But if you’re passing on quality products and replacing them with cheap cosmetics, you may be doing just that.</p>
<p>A <a href=""https://www.cityoflondon.police.uk/advice-and-support/fraud-and-economic-crime/pipcu/wakeupdontfakeup/Pages/wakeupdontfakeup.aspx"" target=""_blank"">press release</a> from London’s&nbsp;Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit, spotted <a href=""http://mashable.com/2015/05/18/fake-make-up-rat-droppings/"" target=""_blank"">by Mashable</a>, warns locals against purchasing illegally made beauty products created with less-than-sanitary ingredients.</p>
<p>According to lab tests, counterfeit perfumes can contain ingredients such as human urine and cyanide.</p>
<p>Products applied directly to the face reportedly have traces of arsenic, mercury and lead. The press release even alleges rat waste is occasionally found in products.</p>
<p>The news comes as part of the legal effort to <a href=""https://www.cityoflondon.police.uk/advice-and-support/fraud-and-economic-crime/pipcu/wakeupdontfakeup/Pages/wakeupdontfakeup.aspx"" target=""_blank"">put an end</a> to more than $139 million in counterfeit cosmetic purchases made yearly in the UK. Among the items are fake styling tools that are liable to overheat and burn both hair and the person using it.</p>
<p>Police warn it’s <a href=""https://www.cityoflondon.police.uk/advice-and-support/fraud-and-economic-crime/pipcu/wakeupdontfakeup/Pages/wakeupdontfakeup.aspx"" target=""_blank"">particularly easy</a> to accidentally buy fake items online because you’re incapable of examining the products.</p>
<p>Double-check the website for grammatical errors before purchasing, as that can be a clue the website’s not all it’s cracked up to be.</p>
<p>Before you buy the product, the FBI <a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2014/january/counterfeit-cosmetics-fragrances-hazardous-to-your-health"" target=""_blank"">recommends</a>&nbsp;price checking your item against other online stores.</p>
<p>If the price is comparable, you’re probably safe from potentially toxic fake cosmetics.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151233/Stocksy_txp4172e78bJqW000_Small_677363-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/men-do-not-like-curly-hair/1094961/,Beauty,I Have Obnoxiously Curly Hair And I Don’t GAF What Men Think About It,"<p>After an upwards of 10 years spent straightening, blowing, flattening and scorching my ringlets into the latest “It” style (read: straight; it’s always some f*cking version of straight), I recently decided to forgo the tools, leave it up to Mother Nature and just wear my curly hair naturally.</p>
<p>I was tired of having to schedule when I should do my hair a week in advance.&nbsp;I was tired of choosing between working out and salvaging my blowout.</p>
<p>Because “doing my hair” isn’t just a 30-minute ordeal.&nbsp;It’s a sweaty, grueling arm workout that take 75 minutes when I’m being careful and 60 when I burn some part of my face.</p>
<p>And just so we’re clear on the definition of “curly” before we move forward with this article, I’m not referring to the girl who has Gisele-like, curling-iron waves and tries to pass this off as <em>wah, curly</em>. No one feels bad for you. Your hair is the sh*t I dream about.&nbsp;I’m talking about Solange-meets-Felicity tight coils that can never be slept on correctly and for which there is no dream Pinterest board.</p>
<p>On a good day (when the weather is bone-dry and slightly cool) my hair has been compared, more often than I consider to be complementary, to Carrie Bradshaw’s.&nbsp;The remaining 364 days of the year, however, it varies somewhere between a gelled Lionel Richie and Shakira’s estranged cousin, caught in a sandstorm.</p>
<p>But I soldier on, wearing my crazy curls proudly, not caring if they get a little messed up or if they’ve expanded two feet, even in air-conditioned spaces.&nbsp;Yes, despite my curly-girl frustrations, I really do love my hair.</p>
<p>That is, until I go out to the Singles’ Club and don’t even get so much as a side-eye glance from a man.</p>
<p><em>Nothing</em>. Not even something I could misconstrue as a remote pick-up line.&nbsp;When trying to grab a man’s attention, it’s like my massive head of hair and the body attached to it don’t even exist (which, given the diameter of my curly mass, is quite a feat).</p>
<p>I don’t get it. I’m not not attractive. I’m embracing the Year of the Booty and wearing dark, flared jeans that have that special “oh-you-workout” effect.&nbsp;I put my happy face on thanks to a generous application of makeup. And as for my curls, I actually styled them, meaning they’re looking closer to Kate Hudson in “Almost Famous.”&nbsp;Everyone loves Penny Lane… or so I thought.</p>
<p>I say this all not to brag, but to paint a picture of the typical scene that’s led me to believe the foregone conclusion: Men Do Not Find Curly Hair Attractive.</p>
<p>To further prove my point — and isolate my hair as the sole variable causing all the problems — I always get favorable male responses after, of course, I’ve succumbed to society’s sleek-hair standards and splurged on a blow-dry bar.&nbsp;I’m talking about both a “Hey, there” <em>and</em> an invitation to drink.</p>
<p>So there. That’s my scientific experiment. Without changing anything except my hairstyle, I’ve convincingly found men&nbsp;favor straight, polished hair.&nbsp;Case closed.</p>
<p>When I asked one of the few men who’s ever-preferred my hair curly over straight why he thought this prevailing sentiment was true, he was genuinely baffled by my observation.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think men, if anything, don’t know how to approach such a bold statement of a person,” was his explanation. “Your hair is not the norm, and it makes you harder to figure out.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Seriously?&nbsp;I have to be comforted with the same men-are-intimidated-by-you excuse that’s doled out to perennially-single girls when you don’t want to hurt their feelings? It’s not even about my personality, it’s about my hair.</p>
<blockquote><p>“<em>I</em> love it. I think it’s sexy. And it’s much more you,” he quickly added.</p></blockquote>
<p>This makes me think of Michelle Williams’ <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2057264/Michelle-Williams-keeps-boys-hair-cut-late-Heath-Ledger.html"" target=""_blank"">quote</a> about her unconventional pixie haircut: “I cut it for the one straight man who has ever liked short hair and I wear it in memorial of somebody who really loved it…. Of course, the only people who like it are gay men and my girlfriends.”</p>
<p>The same holds true for curly hair. Women f*cking love it, have no hesitation touching it and often&nbsp;gasp in excitement over it.&nbsp;No joke, I receive more attention from women than men when I’m out with my natural hair. Women just appreciate the look more.</p>
<p>Normally, when I’m really determined to reign in some male recognition and want a sure-fire come-talk-to-me look from a man, I’ll opt for the blown-out ‘do.&nbsp;It’s not because I don’t like the way I look with straight hair (I actually <em>love</em> the way I feel with a fresh blow-out), it’s that this style is not my hair-texture norm, and I’m afraid of misleading a man about my appearance.</p>
<p>This messed up reasoning has become a pervasive mindf*ck in my early courtship exploits.&nbsp;<em>If I meet a guy with my hair straight, how many dates do I have to wait to flip-the-switch and reveal what I actually look like? Will he still find me attractive with curly hair? Did he not find my Bill Cosby joke funny because I didn’t put gel in?</em></p>
<p>It’s ridiculous, I know. I literally have to reassure myself the Right Man will love me for my natural hair, as if curls are some kind of shortcoming.</p>
<p>Between Dove’s latest <a href=""http://promo.dove.us/loveyourcurls/"" target=""_blank"">Real Beauty Curls</a> campaign and more Love-Your-Whatever advertisements than ever, curly girls are having a moment in the spotlight. For this, I am grateful.&nbsp;Like plus-sized models and gay sex on television, we need more diversity&nbsp;in mainstream media, not only to comfort people like myself, but to also introduce the idea beauty does not come in one set shape, size or, in this case, texture.</p>
<p>Despite all these observations, I’m not asking&nbsp;to stop nor advocating against wearing your hair naturally. I still champion my native curls every day. Because I genuinely love it this way — it feels more “me” — big, unique and real.</p>
<p>The day will come when a curly-haired girl like myself meets a nice guy who appreciates all of her attributes and qualities and textures, both outside and in.&nbsp;Until then, I vow to&nbsp;embrace the fantastic head of hair I’ve been&nbsp;blessed with, bask in the praise from other women and remember, never let my kinks&nbsp;fall flat.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4b69175a8d2b260844ec3aedf14777cc-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/an-open-letter-to-all-single-women-you-are-beautiful/,Beauty,An Open Letter To All Single Women: You Are Beautiful,"<p>Dear all beautiful single women,</p>
<p>What I’m about to say feels extremely ordinary for women as extraordinary as yourselves, but I’m going to say it because I’m tired of all the beautiful girls letting the monotony of being alone chip away at them.</p>
<p>I’m sick of hearing that the sexier, hotter, prettier girls are better. I’m over letting what some loser <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/14-signs-worst-ex-boyfriend-ever/"" target=""_blank"">ex-boyfriend</a> says about you bring you down.&nbsp;What I want to shout over all this ugly noise is that just because you’re single doesn’t mean you’re not beautiful.</p>
<p>This includes you, trying to conceal that you’re going up for seconds. You, worrying that your eyeliner has smudged. You, self-consciously touching her hair at her desk.</p>
<p>Beauty is rare and special and it takes a rare and special person to spot that. You are worth that wait. Think about how long it took to mold the incredible person you’ve become. It’s only natural that it will take longer to find your perfect complement.</p>
<p>Wait for that man who knows what you look like barefaced and thinks it’s even more desirable than after you’ve applied makeup.</p>
<p>The man who understands that it’s more than your body, or what he can see or hold on to or anything that he can experience with five senses. He loves you deeper, to the very fibers of your soul’s being, where your true splendor lies. He’s the one to grow old with you because he believes your beauty is timeless.</p>
<p>Being with just yourself and your thoughts all the time can be quite dulling. We all need a soulmate who will <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/the-beauty-of-falling-in-love-with-someone-who-makes-you-a-better-person/"" target=""_blank"">enliven us</a>. When you find that special someone, he’ll see you for what you possess, not what you think you lack within yourself. He builds you up when you get down on yourself.</p>
<p>It’s not that you’re a stranger to dating, or getting asked out for that matter; it’s that somewhere between being single and shining on your own, you got tired of carrying your own torch.</p>
<p>But if you don’t champion your own exquisite prowess, how are you going to expect others to find that charm within you? Own your beauty and don’t be afraid of that spark you emulate.</p>
<p>Remember, you don’t need a man to ignite this fire, but rather, to enhance your natural brilliance. Don’t lose sight of what makes you this alluring person.</p>
<p>You might not be the person you hoped you’d be or thought you’d be when you were younger, and that’s okay. The man you find won’t put that kind of expectation on you. He will, however, challenge you to be the best version of yourself, and you’ll do the same in return.</p>
<p>What are you doing this Friday night? I bet you don’t have any special plans, and if you do, it probably involves your other single girlfriends. Your nether lands are starting to feel as cold as the Netherlands and you’re debating if it’s even worth putting on the skinny jeans anymore.</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you something about those skinny jeans and a beautiful girl like yourself: There are times when you don’t fit or when you’ve cut too loose, but you will <em>never</em> go out of style.</p>
<p>So get your pants on, and get going. You’ve got a whole world of admirers.</p>
<p><em>With all my love,&nbsp;Laura</em></p>

<p>Calling herself the “curvy Canadian” with measurements of 34-29-44, Mayday was diagnosed with a rare form of ovarian cancer just as she was ready to be signed with modeling agencies in New York and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>She has serous carcinoma, an uncommon form of cancer that is usually seen in post-menopausal women, but Elly and her family are hopeful that she’ll go into remission after her last installment of treatments.</p>
<p>Although the brave model lost 40 pounds due to her illness, she is now resuming her modeling, bearing her bald head, scars and all. And she’s changing the way we view models and cancer patients alike.</p>
<p>In her return to modeling, Mayday can be seen wearing lingerie and a green wig in support of ovarian cancer research. She’s already shot a campaign for Vancouver company Forever Yours Lingerie, which sells lacy undergarments.</p>
<p>Elly Mayday looks even hotter than she did before her diagnosis. Why? Because she’s exuding confidence, pride in her body and strength. And that is a photo worth looking at.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/powerful-illustrations-womens-bodies-photos/655120/,Beauty,These Powerful Illustrations Let Everyone Know Who Controls Women’s Bodies (Photos),"<p>The Hobby Lobby case, which determined that corporations don’t have to pay for birth control, has sparked lots of discussion over who has control over a woman’s body. Is it the government? Is it the woman? Is it Jesus? It’s Jesus.</p>
<p>Just kidding. It’s not Jesus.</p>
<p>Brazilian graphic designer Carol Rossetti posted some beautiful, colorful illustrations of women and their stories on her&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/carolrossettidesign"">Facebook</a>&nbsp;page that she calls <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.607626906023523.1073741830.562486247204256&amp;type=3"" target=""_blank"">“WOMEN in English!</a>”</p>
<p>The pictures portray a great range of potentially sensitive topics, including body image, racism, ableism, sexism, ageism and the LGBTQ identity. A few of the characters are based on real experiences, but others are drawn from inspiration across the Internet.</p>
<p>The project has already affected people on a global scale. The captions were originally written in Portuguese, but Rossetti worked with somebody to translate them into English.</p>
<p>Some Israelis even translated the captions into <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.614889911963889.1073741832.562486247204256&amp;type=3"" target=""_blank"">Hebrew</a>, and other people want to translate them into&nbsp;Russian, German, Spanish, Lithuanian and more.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/video-shows-unnatural-becoming-perfect-woman/747023/,Beauty,This Video Perfectly Breaks Down How Impossible It Is To Look ‘Perfect’,"<p>Women are held to impossible standards of beauty.</p>
<p>Between the media and celebrity culture, the proliferation of Photoshop and the glorification of the “<a href=""http://elitedaily.com/news/world/men-and-women-have-quite-different-ideas-of-what-the-perfect-body-type-is/"" target=""_blank"">perfect</a>” body, society has defined what women should look like: white skin, large breasts and a thin body.</p>
<p>The problem is this: Nobody is perfect and no one “look” is perfect. To strive for perfection is to limit yourself and define yourself on appearance alone. And ladies, we’re better than that.</p>
<p>Beauty comes in all different forms, shapes and sizes. Let’s celebrate it.</p>
<p>This <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-q14ez2NtI"" target=""_blank"">video</a>, an art piece named “Supervenus” by French artist Frédéric Doazan, aims to illustrate just how ridiculous the idea of the perfect woman is.</p>
<p>It begins with a cartoon image of a woman from a vintage illustration. She looks like an average, white woman with curvier hips and thighs, medium breasts and a soft face. Nothing special or dramatic. Instead, she’s made to look simple and plain.</p>
<p>Doazan, the illustrator, begins to “edit” the image of the woman and transforms it into the “perfect” female, with long hair, plump lips and a thin waist.</p>
<p>She’s a completely different illustration than she was in the beginning.</p>
<p>He then works on changing her more, adding larger “implants” to the figure’s breasts and removing her uterus. He then removes the cartoon’s brain.</p>
<p>Finally, the image of the woman sort of just implodes into herself, relaying a somber, yet powerful message.</p>
<p>Perfection is not only unattainable — it’s a dangerous and unfulfilling fantasy to chase.</p>
<p>Celebrate yourself, flaws and all (besides, <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/perfection-is-boring-how-your-flaws-make-you-interesting/"" target=""_blank"">perfection</a> is boring, anyway).</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04150905/Stocksy_txp4eb78dc4luW000_Small_2725751-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/why-gen-ys-definition-of-beauty-is-skewed-and-how-i-tried-to-change-it/,Beauty,Why Gen-Y’s Definition Of Beauty Is Skewed And How I Tried To Change It,"<p>The idea for this article, or maybe even experiment, started when my boyfriend stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We (guys) don’t like it when girls wear makeup; you girls are doing that for yourselves and to yourselves.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I was stunned and replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I bet you wouldn’t even have come to talk to me the night we met if I wasn’t wearing makeup.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It made me think. Why was I wearing makeup? It makes me look prettier, of course. In whose eyes, though? Mine, or those of other people? To other girls or boys? Why is it necessary to make myself look prettier at all?</p>
<p>When I go without makeup, I typically get remarks like: “Are you sick?” “What’s wrong with you?” “You don’t look good.” Little do these people know, it’s just me, barefaced and natural. I usually smile and apologize for my apparently distasteful appearance by saying: <em>“No, sorry, this is just what I look like.”</em></p>
<p>These comments always make me feel bad about myself, but I have to admit, I tend to agree with them.</p>
<h2>The Experiment</h2>
<p>I wanted to do an experiment in which I would go without makeup for one week. I wanted to see what would happen. Would I get less attention from boys? How often would people ask me if I was sick?</p>
<p>More importantly, how would I feel? Would I be aware of the fact I wasn’t wearing makeup all the time? Would I feel more self-conscious? I was praying I wouldn’t have any breakouts that week.</p>
<p>I noticed I was delaying the start of this makeup-free week. I was making all kinds of excuses for why I couldn’t go somewhere without makeup. I put off important parties, meetings and anniversaries. I noticed I really didn’t want to go without makeup cause I wouldn’t feel my best. As soon as I realized what I was doing, I pushed myself to go forth with the experiment. After all, I felt I was being ridiculous for feeling afraid of just being me.</p>
<hr>
<h2>#NowTrending: Natural Beauty</h2>
<p>I kicked off the week by posting a selfie on Instagram and Facebook, so people would know what I was doing and why — a great way to start the discussion.</p>
<p>The comment left by my boyfriend, “How to lose a boyfriend in a week,” got more likes than the actual picture. It was all tough talk, of course, since he insisted he liked me better au naturale. Someone texted me without hesitation to say that I looked great, but I looked better with makeup. Though I may agree, it still pissed me off. I was offended; I felt like I was being criticized for being myself.</p>
<p>In the weeks I was pushing this experiment ahead, the #nomakeupselfie went viral. What started out as support from author Laura Lippman for Kim Novak, who was cruelly critized for her appearance at the Oscars, suddenly turned into a social media campaign for breast cancer awareness. While the connection between the two things is still a bit lost on me, it did spark a discussion about natural beauty.</p>
<p>People who always hated selfies were all of a sudden praising the #nomakeupselfie. Then, of course, there was Beyoncé, who (unintentionally) started a whole campaign for natural beauty with #Iwokeuplikethis. Celebs and normal folks alike posted all their morning wake-up photos.</p>
<p>I noticed that in the #nomakeupselfies and the #Iwokeuplikethis, #flawless selfies, women were smiling and laughing; while in most selfies, we generally try to look sexy, bitchy or some other supermodel imitation. When we go au naturale, we seek to display our inner beauty. We smile, we look more open and we show our softer side. In a way, we are actually still enhancing our looks.</p>
<p>I noticed the same thing when I went outside without makeup on. I tried to hide my blotchy, bare skin under a big smile and shine as much as I could. It wasn’t because I felt free; I feel the need to “make up” for my lack of makeup. I was trying to get people to like me, not for looking “pretty” but for looking happy and nice. Without my concealer, I wanted to conceal my imperfections with a smile.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Realizing My Tendency To Want To Cover Up</h2>
<p>Somehow, the growing support for breast cancer awareness and the waking up flawless campaign felt a bit empty and maybe even fake. Don’t get me wrong, anything that supports good causes like health, cancer awareness, feminism and a healthy self-image, I advocate for. However, most of these pictures touted filters, so that’s adding a layer of concealer in a different way.</p>
<p>Beyoncé covered half her face, and so did many other celebs. Some celebs even had perfect makeup in their #nomakeupselfie. Of course, right after posting these pictures, we all run to the mirror to paint on our faces.</p>
<p>I couldn’t run to my makeup collection after my selfie because I vowed to go a week without it. In my head I was trying to cheat all week: <em>Does dying my eyelashes count as makeup? What about self-tanner? Nail polish?</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>Men vs. Women</h2>
<p>A friend of mine told me that at her old job, every girl was obligated to wear makeup. She said it was because the managers didn’t want the girls’ faces to show whether they were sad or tired.</p>
<p>I’ve had jobs where I wasn’t allowed to wear a lot of crazy makeup and men weren’t allowed to look too grungy. We all had to look clean. However, I find it appalling that women should ever be forced to wear makeup.</p>
<p>I understand that jobs require women to leave our personal lives at home and not look like a zombie at work as a result of some drama-induced episode, but what about men? Do they have to wear concealer and blush to look like their freshest selves? Nope. Only women were forced to wear makeup at said company.</p>
<p>Why does this company not even think twice about telling women their natural faces aren’t appreciated, but for men it’s fine?&nbsp;Somehow makeup is a must for women and unnecessary for men. Why aren’t we just accepted the way we are? Why aren’t the physical appearance expectations of men held to the same standard of women?</p>
<hr>
<h2>Stepping Out Of My Comfort Zone</h2>
<p>During the day, I wouldn’t feel so bad about not wearing any makeup, but I knew that at the end of the week, the biggest challenge would come: going out without anything on my face. A little black dress just doesn’t seem complete without a little bit of black mascara.</p>
<p>I didn’t wear any jewelry that week, or any fancy clothes. Is self-enhancement a slippery slope? If makeup leads to wearing jewelry, fake eyelashes and push-up bras, where do we draw the line? Cosmetic surgery? How many? Are we ever good enough?</p>
<p>So, at the end of the week, I went out in sneakers, jeans and a t-shirt — hair down, no jewelry, just me and some necessary clothing. Where I live, in Malta, girls tend to dress up a lot for going out. The dresses couldn’t be shorter, the heels couldn’t be higher and there is never enough fake eyelashes, glitter or red lipstick. Here, more is more, and less is not good enough. Needless to say, I definitely felt weird.</p>
<p>I was apologizing the whole night for my appearance, even though I knew I shouldn’t. While talking about my makeup-free self, all the boys in the group agreed: They like girls with makeup. Ha! I knew it! One point for me, but then I felt even worse sitting there, face naked.</p>
<p>One guy said <strong>now&nbsp;</strong>he doesn’t care whether his girlfriend wears makeup or not; he thinks she is beautiful either way. His emphasis was on the <strong>now</strong>. He did find makeup important <em>before</em>, but now, because of his love for her, he sees her differently.</p>
<p>It’s like seeing your ex and wondering if he always looked that bad.&nbsp;Yes, he did, but I guess love is like makeup in a way.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Confidence Exudes True Beauty</h2>
<p>As the week went by, I began to see myself differently. Usually, when I would look in the mirror at my bare face, I would see an unfinished me — ready for bed, or ready for putting on my real face. However, after a week of no makeup at all, I saw myself differently. I saw the same person I would normally see with makeup on: my true self; the real, pretty me.</p>
<p>I think it’s perfectly acceptable for a woman to prefer to wear makeup. I feel better about myself with my mascara and blush applied, but, please, let’s not criticize each other for not all doing the same. I would very much like to be able to hold my naked head high, and I applaud women who do the same with confidence.</p>
<p>Realizing how obsessed I was with not being able to wear makeup made me realize how strong these chains are. We fail to recognize beauty without enhancing it, and men fail to recognize our beauty without us enhancing it. Even though we are all momentarily celebrating our true beauty online, offline, we are enhancing, hiding and portraying ourselves differently than how we really look. Enhancing in itself leads to bigger issues. There is always bigger, better, more.</p>
<p>Only if we would drop all the make-up and flattering beauty-products, we could be truly happy with all we got. But because we keep changing the way we naturally are, our faces will be perceived as unhealthy when they are naked, photoshop will make us all feel like walking cellulite disasters and cosmetic surgery makes us question all of our body parts.</p>
<p>The obsession with beauty is greater than I even realized. Can we ever show who we truly are?</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/beautiful-girl-such-thing/721531/,Beauty,Why There’s No Such Thing As A Beautiful Girl,"<p>“Thin. Pretty. Big tits… Your basic nightmare.”</p>
<p>Marie couldn’t have said it better. “When Harry Met Sally” taught me a lot of things, but none more pressing than the arrival of beautiful women in my life.</p>
<p>They are indeed my nightmare. My compadres, my sisters, my friends, yet — indeed — my worst f*cking nightmare.&nbsp;And these beautiful women are everywhere, trust me… I’m a woman and I see them every day.</p>
<p>I see them running across the street, slouching in line at the deli, eating at the table across from me. Sitting at the bar, standing at the door and stretching in yoga.</p>
<p>They’re the reason I have a constant knot in my back and a twitch in my left eye. They’re the reason I secretly worry about the texture of my hair and the size of my bust. They’re the reason I feel insecure leaving the house without makeup. They’re the reason I’m tired all the time.</p>
<p>Tired of wondering how many girls on the subway are hotter than I am. Tired of worrying if I should eat that bagel and tired of second-guessing every shirt I put on. Tired of wishing I had certain features or didn’t have specific “flaws.” I’m so damn tired of the pretty race.</p>
<p>I’ve spent the past years in a constant state of stress and worry, not because I’m scared of being ugly, but because if I’m not pretty or cute or hot, what will my definer be?</p>
<p>For centuries, women have been bogged down with the plague of the “one attribute” definition. This one attribute always revolves around their physical appearance and it’s what keeps smart, witty and intelligent women unaccredited and unappreciated.</p>
<p>It’s what keeps the accomplishments and skills of hardworking women, unnoticed and unimportant. Because as we all know, women with great personalities are always discriminated against for their looks.</p>
<p>If a woman has a great personality then she mustn’t be beautiful, right? At least that’s how Bruno Kirby believed women to be in the famous scene with Billy Crystal. In his mind, if a woman’s beautiful, there’s no need for her to have a good personality, right?</p>
<p>This is where the problem lies when it should be the other way around. If a woman has a great personality, she shouldn’t need to be beautiful. Instead, we’ve decided that if a woman is unattractive, she has failed in some way. A woman’s good personality is only a consolation prize in the pretty race she lost.</p>
<p>When did a woman’s worth become solely dependent on her looks? When did her definer have to include a mental picture? When did attributes that will last long past looks fade away before getting a chance to come out?</p>
<p>When did women have to acquiesce to this standard of beautiful or nothing?</p>
<p>A woman isn’t just beautiful any more than a man is just tall. She’s got a complexity of attributes and traits that define her worth and her status much more than her features, and it’s time we start looking at women as more than <em>just</em> beautiful.</p>
<h2>Beauty is unquantifiable</h2>
<p>Because beauty cannot be set to one standard, there is no such thing as one type of beauty.</p>
<p>It exists in more than just symmetrical faces and petite features. It lies in a person’s soul, the way he or she radiates from the inside, out.</p>
<p>It’s why people who have great personalities become more beautiful the more you get to know them. It’s also why people who are “classically” beautiful are not always seen that way by people who have known them for who they really are.</p>
<p>It’s this elusive status that means nothing because beauty cannot be defined until someone is truly understood. Beauty is subjective, changing from person to person until everyone is just another beautiful person to someone else.</p>
<p>If everyone is beautiful to someone, describing a woman as just beautiful is giving her as basic a definer as the color of her hair.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Beauty is something we’ve made important</h2>
<p>Beauty is a standard we’ve created. It’s a position we’ve deemed as first and most important. Making women feel like losers in a race they never asked to run in. They are standing on podiums with “hot” “cute” and “beautiful” as first, second and third, crying over a medal they never wanted to compete for.</p>
<p>But why does beautiful trump intelligent? Why does beautiful sit at the top of the tower? Why does every woman with a great personality feel like she’s always second rate?</p>
<p>This phenomenon is perfectly encapsulated in “When Harry Met Sally,” as Jess and Harry discuss society’s preoccupation with beauty over personality.</p>
<blockquote><p>Jess: When someone is not that attractive, they’re always described as having a good personality.</p>
<p>Harry: Look, if you would ask me, ‘What does she look like?’ and I said, ‘She has a good personality.’ That means she’s not attractive. But just because I happened to mention that she has a good personality, she could be either. She could be attractive with a good personality, or not attractive with a good personality.</p>
<p>Jess: So which one is she?</p>
<p>Harry: Attractive.</p>
<p>Jess: But not beautiful, right?</p></blockquote>
<p>That last line crushes every woman’s soul.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we’ve all felt the sting of incompleteness. As great as Harry described Sally, she will always be thought of by Jess as “attractive, but not beautiful.”</p>
<p>Her rate reduced to a sub-par categorization. Yet even if she were “just beautiful,” she’d still be reduced to a definition that hardly encapsulates her true being or the myriad complexities that make her indescribable.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/startup-offer-women-unlimited-blowouts/952883/,Beauty,New Startup Will Offer Women Unlimited Blowouts For Just $99 A Month,"<p>Living in New York is expensive. Pampering yourself in New York? Next to impossible, unless you’re willing to subsist on Ramen for a paycheck cycle (we’ve all done it).</p>
<p>Well, it was impossible — until now.</p>
<p>Enter <a href=""http://vive.co/#/"" target=""_blank"">Vive</a>, the answer to every New Yorker’s hair woes.</p>
<p>The startup, similar in theory to ClassPass, is a subscription-based service for blowouts.</p>
<p>Just $99 per month will buy you unlimited wash and dry treatments at New York’s highest-rated salons (a serious score, considering most blowouts&nbsp;cost upward of $50 per session).</p>
<p>Founder Alanna Gregory started the company after realizing there were few places to get a last-minute, affordable blowout in the city.</p>
<p>She tells <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/vive-offers-unlimited-blowouts-for-99-and-manicures-for-49-2015-3"" target=""_blank"">Business Insider</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>I was getting my hair blown out pretty frequently. I have very curly hair.</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead of splurging on biweekly salon visits — which rack up a hefty price tag — she wanted to create an affordable, reliable service for hair care.</p>
<p>So Gregory teamed up with her stylist of 10 years, Cristin Armstrong, to launch Vive.</p>
<p>Each salon in Vive’s network is hand selected by the pair.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/vive-offers-unlimited-blowouts-for-99-and-manicures-for-49-2015-3"" target=""_blank"">Gregory says</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re very strict about quality control.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/vive-offers-unlimited-blowouts-for-99-and-manicures-for-49-2015-3"" target=""_blank"">Business Insider</a> reports&nbsp;that Vive may also offer unlimited monthly manicures for $49, though Gregory refused to comment on that possibility.</p>
<p>Regardless, the blowout package will launch by the end of this month, and the city’s well-styled set are getting seriously excited.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/vive-offers-unlimited-blowouts-for-99-and-manicures-for-49-2015-3"" target=""_blank"">Gregory confirms</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>The salon experience is something people really enjoy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once funding goes through — the founders expect to raise about $1 million in the next few months — there’s no doubt that Vive will be huge.</p>
<p>It is, after all, the first service of its kind — not to mention, one that will save thousands of women thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>It’s innovation at its finest (as far as the beauty buffs of NYC are concerned).</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/14-lasting-side-effects-of-growing-up-as-the-ugly-duckling/,Beauty,14 Lasting Side Effects Of Growing Up As The Ugly Duckling,"<p>If you’re like me, you grew up being taunted by your unfortunate, disproportionate or unusual appearance. Even though you’ve developed into a beautiful swan since you’ve reached adulthood, you have difficulty shaking the ugly duckling syndrome that was deeply ingrained in your developing brain during childhood.</p>
<p>In your mind, you’re still the person you used to be, not the person you are today. While there are some downfalls to living your adult life with this syndrome, there are certainly some benefits to balance them out.</p>
<p>Here are the 14 signs of ugly duckling syndrome, as experienced by you, the now beautiful swan.</p>
<h2>1. You have difficulty accepting a compliment.</h2>
<p>At the hands of any kind words paid in your direction, you become uncomfortable and rebuke with a self-deprecating statement or silent rationalization of why the compliment can’t be true.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. The idea of jealousy pointed in your direction is baffling.</h2>
<p>Because you can’t rationalize that you are someone worthy of targeted jealousy, you have difficulty understanding the hostility you receive from other women.</p>
<p>You don’t understand why women have the tendency to compete with you, and you can’t fathom why the existence of “frenemies” is present in your life. You also put the blame on yourself for lost or undeveloped friendships.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. You see yourself as a conversationalist, not an object of desire.</h2>
<p>When you’re out socializing in a bar or a nightclub, you’re nice to people, but being approached by a member of the opposite sex is rationalized in your mind as an innocent conversation, not a pick-up tactic. When a stranger asks for your number or pays the bill from across the bar, you’re shocked.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Stares from men (and women) come as an insult, not a compliment.</h2>
<p>When out and about minding your own business, you’re put off by eye contact with strangers. You become defensive and take the stare as an assumed insult, rather than what it truly is: a compliment.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. Your vision is poor when it comes to noticing appreciation from others.</h2>
<p>Though the stares you do catch from others come as an insult, they come rather rarely, since the majority of looks you receive aren’t on your radar. Since you’re not aware of your beauty, you’re not on the lookout for others noticing it, and because of this, you hardly ever notice the appreciative glances in your direction.</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. The powers of your beauty are lost on you completely.</h2>
<p>You don’t realize you can get nearly anything you want or have almost anyone you desire based solely on your looks. Therefore, you rely on your smarts, your integrity and your inner strength to get ahead in life.</p>
<hr>
<h2>7. When beauty is expected, you become a neurotic mess.</h2>
<p>You’re much more comfortable being the simple, makeup-free you, and when beauty is expected for special occasions, you feel anxious and nervous. Suddenly you have nothing to wear and your makeup and hair are a mess. The object of beautifying yourself is, needless to say, a nerve-racking feat.</p>
<hr>
<h2>8. You opt for moral correctness.</h2>
<p>You have difficulty fathoming how other women leverage their beauty in immoral ways, and the thought of such immorality gets your head spinning and tummy feeling woozy.</p>
<hr>
<h2>9. You value inner beauty.</h2>
<p>Because you had no choice as a child but to turn inward to find your beauty, you now look for the same in others. You judge a book by what’s inside, not the pretty cover.</p>
<hr>
<h2>10. You have high expectations in friends and loved ones.</h2>
<p>You won’t be friends with someone just because he or she is pretty and popular. Since you learned at a young age that values and morals are much greater than appearances and facades, you have high expectations of your friends.</p>
<p>You grow slowly connected to your friends, knowing it takes time to discover one’s inner beauty, and once you’ve established a friend, you consider him or her a friend for life.</p>
<hr>
<h2>11. You have an undying need to stand up for the less fortunate.</h2>
<p>Nothing gets your blood boiling more than seeing someone being bullied, picked on or humiliated by stronger (and meaner) individuals. When faced with these situations, you suddenly transform into a human rights activist, a raging protective figure, a knight in shining armor or a combination of all three.</p>
<hr>
<h2>12. You appreciate your privacy.</h2>
<p>Though you’ve likely developed your social skills much more than those who were beautiful from birth, you still appreciate your privacy and alone time. You might light up a room when you enter it, but since you likely don’t realize it, you prefer to light up your own quiet room, instead.</p>
<hr>
<h2>13. Other beautiful women inspire you.</h2>
<p>Although an annual dose of inspiration is found watching the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, you truly look up to the women in your life who you believe are beautiful on the inside and out.</p>
<hr>
<h2>14. You aspire to be beautiful</h2>
<p>…Not realizing you already are.</p>
<p>Do you think you might be suffering from ugly duckling syndrome? Well, as it turns out, there’s no need to pay a visit to your therapist, since the benefits are clearly much greater than the side effects.</p>
<p>Just keep being the beautiful swan you are, and keep putting forth the many great lessons you learned as an ugly duckling.</p>
<p>Learn to give yourself credit once in a while, will you?</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151400/Stocksy_txpcd7015d3EgW000_Small_334655-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/things-you-should-know-before-getting-brazilian-wax/1046783/,Beauty,7 Essential Tips You Need To Know Before Getting A Brazilian Wax,"<p>Ah, the Brazilian wax.</p>
<p>It’s often the subject of graphic horror stories among friends. It’s taboo for mothers who grew up in the 70s.</p>
<p>It’s the fantasy of many porn-obsessed 17-year-old boys. And it’s a personal choice.</p>
<p>After&nbsp;announcing my plans to undergo this process for the first time and then write about it, my friends&nbsp;offered advice, tips and sympathy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Remind yourself that even if I feels like your vagina is being ripped off, it probably isn’t.</p>
<p>Your hair has to be as long as a grain of rice.</p>
<p>Don’t look down.</p></blockquote>
<p>I heard all of this (I’ll spare&nbsp;you the more graphic details), and I still wasn’t fazed. I could handle a little pain. People got Brazilian waxes all the time. It would be OK. I could handle it.</p>
<p>Nope. I’ll publicly admit it was the worst pain I’ve ever felt.</p>
<p>Specifically, when&nbsp;she arrived at&nbsp;my innermost nether region,&nbsp;my waxer announced, “This is the most painful section,” and I seriously thought about jumping off the table, putting my underwear back on and going back to my trusty razor.</p>
<p>One of my friends described it as a “childbirth-like experience.”</p>
<p>In the moment, you can’t think of any good reason you should be doing this to your body.</p>
<p>But when it’s over, you forget about the pain, and you think to yourself, “Oh, that wasn’t that bad. Now I have this soft, hairless bundle of joy.”</p>
<p>Although the advice from my lovely friends was somewhat helpful, I decided to go to the professionals (something I should have done&nbsp;<em>before</em>) and&nbsp;hear their tips&nbsp;on the hair removal process.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;spoke with Christi Alldredge, a senior specialist at <a href=""http://www.sprucebond.com/"" target=""_blank"">Spruce &amp; Bond</a>, to get expert advice on this popular beauty trend.</p>
<h2>1. You have options.</h2>
<p>If going completely bare&nbsp;makes you feel like a 7-year-old again, you can opt for leaving a strip of hair or a triangle shape.</p>
<p>Can’t decide? Alldredge&nbsp;suggests doing “whatever makes you feel comfortable and confident!”</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. Pop pills beforehand.</h2>
<p>Obviously, removing every hair from an extremely sensitive part of your body is going to be painful.</p>
<p>So, take some precautions. According to Alldredge, “It’s a really good idea to take ibuprofen 30 minutes before your appointment.” It’ll help reduce the discomfort.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Schedule your appointment according to your cycle.</h2>
<p>Yeah, your waxer doesn’t need to work around a conspicuous tampon string.</p>
<p>Alldredge notes, “You are much more sensitive to pain during your period, so try to schedule in the&nbsp;week or two following.”</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Waxing doesn’t make your hair thicker.</h2>
<p>This is a shady old wives’ tale your mom tells you when she wants to shelter you from all that pain and suffering.</p>
<p>Hair doesn’t become any thicker after a Brazilian wax; Alldredge says hair actually becomes “finer over time.”</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. You get what you pay for.</h2>
<p>Toilet paper, shoes and Brazilian waxes all have one thing in common: They should always be splurged on. Alldredge suggests going to a “place you can trust” because the “quality of wax and experience of the person waxing you is very important.”</p>
<p>And this is not an area you want to&nbsp;mess around with.</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. Some medications can alter&nbsp;your skin down there.</h2>
<p>Just <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/life/scary-facts-fake-tanning-women-need-know/1001201/"" target=""_blank"">like tanning</a>, waxing can be affected by certain medications.</p>
<p>Alldredge warns potential clients against waxing when taking Accutane, and she suggests avoiding “any exfoliating products like scrubs, or anything with ingredients such as retinol or alpha hydroxy acids a week before your wax. ” These products can result in skin sensitivity, which in turn,&nbsp;makes you susceptible to unwanted&nbsp;side effects.</p>
<hr>
<h2>7. Avoid immediate exercise.</h2>
<p>Yes! There’s finally a good reason to skip the gym. Your sore crotch does not need to be bouncing up and down on a spinning bike (or another person) directly after a waxing appointment.</p>
<p>Alldredge says you should wait until the day after to go back to your workout routine.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04150913/Stocksy_txp7d39a704GkW000_Small_438350-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/why-you-should-date-a-girl-who-has-curly-hair/,Beauty,Why You Should Date A Girl Who Has Curly Hair,"<p>In kindergarten at a fancy private school, I received a compliment that would forever stay with me.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Laura, you can no longer wear your hair down in the classroom. It’s a distraction to your classmates,” </em>said Mrs. Halleron, my head teacher.</p></blockquote>
<p>At just 5 years old, I already had a mane of coiled hair that was as supreme as Diana Ross’. Apparently it was too big for this world of primly dolls in barrettes whose hair textures weren’t detrimental to the learning of the other children.</p>
<p>As a total narcissist from a young age, if my hair was the focus of the classroom, I’d want to keep it that way. But this was bigger than me. This was for fro-y toddlers everywhere who don’t yet have the coordination or years of expertise to care for their own kinks. It wasn’t our faults we didn’t have access to a Johnson &amp; Johnson curls product line.</p>
<p>We wouldn’t be humiliated into pulling our hair back into pom-pom ponytails just because some kids couldn’t stop touching our bushes during storytime.</p>
<p><em>“Can’t I just sit in the back?” </em></p>
<p>It wasn’t much (and I now believe this compromise was a direct cause of my <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/life/23-things-that-only-people-who-wear-glasses-will-understand/"" target=""_blank"">blackboard blindness</a>), but it was a small victory for cute “Annie”-style fro kids everywhere. The sun will indeed come out tomorrow (and we know how that low-humidity weather excites us curly-haired ladies).</p>
<p>I was allowed to continue wearing my hair down, provided I did not obstruct the views of the other children.</p>
<p>Though, in retrospect, after looking at past school photos of my mother’s attempts to tame my Big Bird mane, maybe Mrs. Halleron was on my side…</p>
<hr>
<p>Girls with seriously curly hair have a mutual respect for one another. I’m not talking about the kind of curl that looks like a Victoria’s Secret model wave. Those blessed hair Athenas know they don’t belong in the same category as the rest of us free-frizz-balling lasses. I’m referring to authentic, I-once-tried-relaxing-it-with-chemicals-in-the-90s, curly-haired ladies.</p>
<p>When we see a fellow corkscrew, we have an understanding that comes from years of accepting that our hair can never look like Gisele’s without a ton of effort. We harbor a special deference stemming from a shared experience in which we both got high off unapproved FDA keratin. And that is a gateway drug no straight-haired girls were ever exposed to (those naive, flat-haired beauty queens…)</p>
<p>You’ll know a beautifully curly-haired girl when you see her proudly bouncing along with her curls. She’s got a head full of twists and a certain spunk about her. You literally get lost in these girls’ locks, so here’s to hoping you find the key.</p>
<p>Here’s why you should date a curly-haired girl:</p>
<h2>1. She turns up the volume</h2>
<p>Curly-haired girls aren’t afraid to stand out or spiral out of control. They’ve got a wild side to spice up any routine, and they know how to live big. Curly girls are used to pumping it up a notch, being bold and letting their hair down. We kind of got a big head about it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. She won’t cut it short</h2>
<p>Just like in the bedroom, a curly-haired chick knows better than to cut her hair off. She also won’t bang out lest she becomes attached and then it requires too much upkeep. That’s why coiled girls got it going on — they know just how long it takes to keep it looking good.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Rainy days are a cinch</h2>
<p>If it’s super gross outside, she’ll have no qualms keeping dry and opting to cuddle with her partner, instead. <em>Hello, have you seen Susie Carmichael by the pool?</em></p>
<p>Alternatively, if you two prefer to brave the storm, she won’t care that the rain ruins her style since she didn’t have much of one to begin with.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. She’s not afraid to try new things</h2>
<p>Chances are a wavy girl is pretty adventurous, especially after testing dozens of gels and mousses and products on her locks. Her experiences have made her extremely knowledgeable (even if it is on the subject of hair care), and she’s always willing to give something a first shot at winning her over. If you’re lucky enough, she’ll swear by your skills until you go out of style.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. The girl can twirl</h2>
<p>Sometimes you just gotta make like Florence + the Machine’s and “Shake it Out.” A curly-haired girl will be right there with you.</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. She gives great head</h2>
<p>Come on, we’re not above this joke — mainly because it’s true. A curly-haired lady can do all sorts of things with her head. She can rock all kinds of styles and constantly surprise you. This girl is all about changing it up, keeping it playful and embracing versatility.</p>
<hr>
<h2>7. She can’t be replicated</h2>
<p>From looking like Beyoncé, to a member of the Continental Congress, no curly-haired girl is the same. They’ve got different textures, cuts, curl velocity and bounce and are proud of their unique spirals. Underneath every blow-dryer is a special set of screws.</p>
<hr>
<h2>8. She can roll with the punches</h2>
<p>Whether it’s owning a bad hair day or taking her aggression out on an elastic, a curly-haired girl can take anything in stride. She’s also capable of overcoming any obstacle — like when her big hair gets in the way of hugging people.</p>
<hr>
<h2>9. She plans ahead</h2>
<p>A curly-haired girl does not leave her styling up to chance; she’s got the whole week of hairdos planned. You’ll never hear her suggest spontaneously jumping into the pool or having a romantic shower after sex (unless she can leave to spray her hair real quick afterwards). When it comes to sticking to plans, though, and getting shizz done, she’s your girl.</p>
<hr>
<h2>10. Nature is her nurture</h2>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/road-to-a-positive-self-image/1038867/,Beauty,Beauty Comes From Within: How I Found My Positive Self-Image,"<p>I used to stare in the mirror and hate what I saw.</p>
<p>I’d glare at myself from head to toe, poking and prodding at each section of my body that I thought needed improvement.</p>
<p>I’d formulate extreme plans in my head on how to change the parts of me that I couldn’t bear&nbsp;to look at. “Maybe if I only eat vegetables I can lose this extra weight,” I’d mutter to myself.&nbsp;And perhaps if I can save up enough money, I can fix my nose.</p>
<p>I would limit my intake of food to try to lose an extra pound while I slipped into my size 0 jeans. I’d try makeup tactics to mute my features.</p>
<p>But, the truth was, the more I tried to “improve” myself, the more miserable I became.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is almost impossible not to judge your body image as an impressionable teen in our society.</p>
<p>Though we are taking strides to change the ideals of a woman’s perfect image, we undeniably are faced daily with magazine covers, advertisements and articles of clothing that subconsciously remind us we are less than perfect.</p>
<p>My question now is who gives a damn?</p>
<p>I grew up in a family obsessed with body image and health. Each morning, they’d sit around babbling about who worked out harder, comparing their progress and sipping on freshly-made juices.</p>
<p>You do not understand the term “fit-fam” until you have sat at vegan breakfast with my parents and siblings post-CrossFit workout.</p>
<p>They dissect everything they eat to make sure it is vegan, gluten free, organic, low fat and high fiber, limiting the intake and being sure not to “overeat.”</p>
<p>I can hardly complain; I know many would love to be in my situation, living in a household that encourages health. My mother is a great vegan cook and helps many on their roads to wellness.</p>
<p>But, seeing it first-hand, I believe the goal my family has is not <em>always</em> about wellness, and often slips toward physical appearance. That simply drives me mad.</p>
<p>Growing up in this immediate environment made my journey to self-confidence a rocky one. Being scrutinized for “unhealthy” eating often led me to scrutinize myself.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I moved out and went to college that I was able to break the pattern.</p>
<p>I realized that no matter how thin I was, I would only want to be thinner. No matter how much I deprived myself, I would only want to deprive myself more, and no amount of exercise would ever lead to confidence when I was doing it for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>People who are trying to obtain unrealistic outward physical goals will never be happy. They will always want more.</p>
<p>I am casting no shade whatsoever on those who enjoy working out and bettering themselves. I, too, workout daily and try to improve myself.</p>
<p>But, the difference between me doing so now and doing so before is that I do it for <i>health, </i>as a hobby, and as a stress reliever<i>.</i></p>
<p>I do not have unrealistic expectations. If my body ends up changing, great, that’s a bonus! If not, fine, that wasn’t my ultimate goal anyway.</p>
<p>I am confidently in a place of my life where my image in the mirror does not define who I am as a person. I am healthy, and that is all I care about.</p>
<p>How did I get here? There were a lot of things I had to let go of:</p>
<p>I had to let go of the idea that other people cared about how I looked&nbsp;and realize that striving for my definition of the perfect image was completely selfish.</p>
<p>When it comes down to it,&nbsp;<i>you </i>are your biggest critic and it is up to <i>you </i>to decide if you prefer confidence or a goal that will never satisfy you.</p>
<p>I had to realize that when I was putting my health on the line in order to look a way only <i>I </i>cared about, I had gone too far.</p>
<p>I realized there are so many better things in life to be than skinny. There is SO much more to life than the way I look.</p>
<p>There are foods to taste, places to see and things to try that I will never deprive myself of because I don’t want the added calories.</p>
<p>Whoever first said, “Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels,” deserves to be force fed a mac ‘n’ cheese topped burger.</p>
<p>Then tell me that doesn’t taste better than skinny, girlfriend.</p>
<p>Confidence became part of me when I stopped comparing myself to other people. That is a nasty habit that needs to be blunted as soon as it begins. You are not anybody else.</p>
<p>You are you; you have wonderful qualities that make you who you are. The comparing game leads nowhere but self destruction.</p>
<p>Confidence also came with encouraging myself and other people to be their best selves.</p>
<p>Hating on skinny girls will not lose you any more pounds, and wrongfully calling someone anorexic will not make you feel any better about your size.</p>
<p>When you stop tearing others down to mask your insecurities, you will be better able to face them head on, which is what you need to do in order to eliminate them.</p>
<p>The most important part of gaining positive self-image for me was recognizing my positive qualities and doing things to emphasize them.</p>
<p>I am smart, driven, witty and a good friend. I think I have many great qualities, and I don’t feel that I should be ashamed to say so. Nobody should.</p>
<p>I am earning my masters degree, I enjoy volunteer work and I like to immerse myself in new cultures. Focusing on bettering myself in ways besides physical helps my self-image immensely.</p>
<p>These qualities and many others make me great, and they have absolutely nothing to do with the way I look. Being thin won’t get me a job or friends — my inner characteristics will.</p>
<p>If someone cannot see past your body image to get to know who you are, he or she is by no means worth your time.</p>
<p>Cut people out of your life who tear you down. If you are aiming for self-confidence, but have friends who&nbsp;constantly talk about their cellulite in the mirror, you will never get there.</p>
<p>Or simply, ask your friends to keep a “fat-talk-free” zone. Conversing about weight will do nothing but make you fixate on it.</p>
<p>Don’t talk about your physical insecurities because it only brings light to them and gives them power.</p>
<p>Instead, when you are feeling less than beautiful, take a step away from the mirror and positively affirm yourself of all the non-tangible reasons you are great.</p>
<p>Be healthy. I eat healthy, but don’t deprive myself of a good burger when I need it.&nbsp;Exercise.</p>
<p>It makes you feel great, but don’t do it simply to look a certain way.</p>
<p>I found running was more enjoyable for me when I did it to see how far I could get, not how many calories I could burn.</p>
<p>I found lifting was more rewarding when I saw myself getting stronger, not because I wanted a six-pack.</p>
<p>Abs are made in the kitchen, but so are sandwiches, and I’d prefer a six-pack of craft beer over six-pack abs any day. It’s what makes me happy.</p>
<p>Gaining confidence in yourself is not easy. It takes practice and sometimes it takes quite a while.</p>
<p>I used to think that what the mirror would show me was what I needed to make me happy.</p>
<p>I couldn’t have been more wrong. I think I am beautiful not because of my image, but because I am happy with who I am.</p>
<p>I found that as soon as I loved who I was on the inside, I began to love the way I looked on the outside, too.</p>
<p>My heart hurts&nbsp;for the girls who think reaching the ideal image will make you happy.</p>
<p>To my sister: I love you, you are beautiful from the inside out, and I can’t wait until the day that you recognize that.</p>
<p>I am not perfect, and I want to better my inner self for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I have simply recognized the beauty in knowing that the mirror will never provide me the happiness that having a positive self-image has.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151559/Stocksy_txp481733e1UiW000_Small_462249-800x400.jpg

<p>The Target fail has since been wisely removed from the site (imagine how confusing it must have been to determine your size!), but that hasn’t stopped them from hacking other models <a href=""http://jezebel.com/http-res-cloudinary-com-gawker-media-image-upload-v13-1540999903"" target=""_blank"">as well</a>.

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/5-ways-every-girl-can-feel-beautiful-whenever-she-wants/,Beauty,5 Ways Every Girl Can Feel Beautiful Whenever She Wants,"<p>Now that spring has sprung, it’s time to wake up, smell the flowers and feel good about ourselves. Winter glum is a force that plagues far too many and regaining self-esteem, along with a fresh, positive attitude, can require quite the concerted effort.</p>
<p>But have no fear, below are five awesome ways to feel beautiful — no boyfriend required!</p>
<h2>1. Give someone else a compliment and mean it.</h2>
<p>Don’t just give anyone a compliment — give someone a compliment that you know he or she will truly appreciate. The compliment doesn’t have to be about aesthetics, it can be about something deeper than that. Compliment someone about his or her kindness or quick wit. Altruistic behavior without pretense can be surprisingly satisfying. If you grant someone else the power to feel good about him or herself, you will too.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. Accentuate one of your features.</h2>
<p>Pick out one of your features of which you feel most proud of and accentuate it! Pretend that your favorite feature is your secret weapon for feeling confident about important things like interviews or meetings. For some, the lips are a favorite feature, so they pick out a new lip color and rock it. My eyes are my favorite feature, so I always have mascara handy for a quick touch up. You can also pick a non-aesthetic feature, such as your love for a certain hobby.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Dress to impress yourself.</h2>
<p>Too many women dress how in a way that they believe that men desire. Too often, we focus on what others find sexy rather than what we find to be appealing. This can lead to a lot of unnecessary anxiety about our appearances. Next time you go shopping, pick out clothes that YOU find appealing. If you feel that you look great, nothing else matters. It’s guaranteed that you will feel better about yourself if you’re wearing something that you have picked out. Of course, try not to get too carried away.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Treat yourself to something that makes you happy.</h2>
<p>Every person has something that never fails to make him or her feel better. Maybe it’s a song or maybe it’s a favorite drink, either way, a little treat can go a long way. If you’re feeling low, treat yourself to a frappe from the coffee shop or a manicure. Pick something little that makes you feel happy and instantly boosts your mood. Don’t be afraid to treat yourself — you’re totally worth it!</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. Get some exercise.</h2>
<p>If you don’t like something, then change it! Despite what most people think, exercise is an incredible anti-depressant. Also, exercise can give you an incredible endorphin high that will instantly make you feel better about yourself and give you a happy glow.</p>
<p>You will also be less critical of yourself after a workout because you will feel as though you did something worthwhile for your health. And, anything that makes you feel simultaneously less critical about yourself and happy is a fabulous thing!</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151224/Stocksy_txp787c3ba1cnW000_Small_126641-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/contouring-makeup-how-to/1046608/,Beauty,How To Use Contouring To Actually Make Your Boobs Look Bigger (Photos),"<p>The power of makeup is pretty incredible, especially when it comes contouring.</p>
<p>Thanks to celebs like Kim K,&nbsp;contouring has become a mainstream makeup trick a lot of ladies use to&nbsp;achieve perfect, chiseled cheekbones.</p>
<p>But did you know you can&nbsp;use&nbsp;contouring for more than just your face?</p>
<p>That’s right, this coveted, age-old makeup trick can also be used to&nbsp;enhance your boobs.&nbsp;I repeat: You can now use makeup to make your lady lumps look bigger!</p>
<p>If you’re not sure how contouring works, let me break it down for you.</p>
<p>It’s basically an optical illusion.</p>
<p>Contouring tricks your eyes by using shadow and light to distort your perception of depth, therefore, it makes things seem larger or smaller than they really are.</p>
<p>By using makeup to make something darker, with say, bronzer, you create a shadowing effect that&nbsp;makes the shaded area appear farther away.</p>
<p>On the other hand, using makeup to make something&nbsp;lighter has the opposite effect and&nbsp;makes the highlighted area appear more prominent by bringing it into the foreground of your vision.</p>
<p>So, when it comes to contouring your breasts, all you have to do is use some strategically placed light and dark makeup to create a shadowing effect that looks exactly like faux cleavage. Simple!</p>
<p>With this little trick, we can finally have the killer cleavage we’ve always dreamed of without stuffing socks in our bras or going under the knife.</p>
<p>Since I’m always looking for ways to increase my bust, I set out&nbsp;to master the art of cleavage contouring and show you step-by-step how it’s done.</p>
<p>Your boyfriend can thank me later.</p>
<h2>All you need to make your boobs look bigger is a little makeup and a lesson in cleavage contouring, which you are about to receive.</h2>

<h2>You’ll need an angled brush, a powder brush, a setting powder, a powder or cream bronzer two shades darker than your natural skin tone and a powder highlighter two shades lighter than your natural skin tone.&nbsp;To make it easy, you can just get a contour palette that has all the shades you need.</h2>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/women-shouldnt-wear-makeup-first-date-guy/657045/,Beauty,Dare To Go Bare: 4 Reasons Why A Girl Shouldn’t Wear Makeup On A First Date,"<p>Every single woman likely has a first date ritual in her repertoire.</p>
<p>For many women, it probably includes dusting off the tried and true LBD, finding the classic pair of pumps that would never be worn out to a bar on Friday, and maybe even mixing a drink to take the edge off before the new date arrives at the door.</p>
<p>And judging by the amount of beauty tutorials gearing for first date scenarios in fashion magazines, I’m certain that many women also have a makeup routine that is seemingly religiously practiced before opening the door to greet the guy on the other side.</p>
<p>But while makeup might appear to enhance and elevate, hopefully more women will consider baring it all on their first date.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to be in the business of shaming women into doing one thing or another. But there are too many women who rely on makeup as a crutch, without ever considering that foundation and concealer doesn’t need to be present for a person to feel beautiful.</p>
<p>If women truly “put their face on” to please themselves, then I’m all for it. But I’d still suggest going on at least one blind date where your face is as blank a slate as your history with the individual sitting across from you.</p>
<p>Why? There are many reasons we can point to for braving a face free of makeup on a first date.<b><br>
</b></p>
<h2>Women Have To Learn Confidence Without It</h2>
<p>Ask yourself if you really feel better and more beautiful with makeup on, or if you’ve simply been conditioned to carry yourself with a little more confidence when relying on cosmetic help.</p>
<p>According to Harvard University researcher and author of “Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty” Nancy Etcoff, makeup <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/01/02/does-makeup-hurt-self-esteem/makeup-can-provide-a-fleeting-confidence-boost-to-some"" target=""_blank"">causes a “transient boost of self esteem”</a> instead of creating longer-lasting confidence.</p>
<p>So if women can’t find ways to accept themselves sans any cosmetic assistance, they definitely shouldn’t be looking for a new relationship. The old adage, “You have to learn to love yourself before you can love someone else,” certainly holds true.</p>
<hr>
<h2>If All Goes Well, You’ll Know He’s Interested In More Than A Made-Up Face</h2>
<p><a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0025656"" target=""_blank"">A recent study determined</a> that moderate amounts of cosmetics can boost a woman’s attractiveness — increasing outside perceptions of her likability, trustworthiness and competence.</p>
<p>While this might seem to serve as a surefire reason why women must wear makeup on a first date, knowing this should actually make you inclined to make the opposite move.</p>
<p>Instead of knowing whether this guy was interested in you for your witty conversation, you should question whether he was just preoccupied about showing off his super hot new girlfriend to all his guy friends.</p>
<hr>
<h2>It Allows You To Call The Shots</h2>
<p>The guy asked <i>you </i>out and now he wants to treat you to <i>his </i>favorite place? And who said chivalry was dead?</p>
<p>If you’re like the many women who prefer dudes to be in the driver’s seat (for the first date at least — this isn’t the fucking 1950s), then your makeup (or lack thereof) is one way you can reclaim the date to make the evening be about what you want.</p>
<p>You don’t want to spend 45 minutes in front of the mirror fretting over what a guy you haven’t met yet will think, and you certainly don’t want a deep red lip to set some sort of a precedent that just because he’s already made it clear that he’s paying, you have to look like you’re doing something particularly special.</p>
<p>You’re simply going out with a guy who is going to realize how lucky he is in your company; there’s no need to add anything else to what already seems like a sweet deal for him.</p>
<p>Writer Akilah S. Richards said wearing makeup <a href=""http://everydayfeminism.com/2013/11/make-up-as-my-mask/"" target=""_blank"">can veer from “mere adornment” to “obligation.”</a> Don’t put yourself in a position where you feel like there’s a “look” you must maintain; be yourself, and he’ll be happy for that. And if he isn’t, well, then it’s a good thing you didn’t waste a single swipe of your $24 bottle of liquid eyeliner on him.</p>
<hr>
<h2>It’s the Great Un-Equalizer</h2>
<p>It’s easy to see how men have it easy: They have higher paychecks than women, more job mobility and, oh yeah,&nbsp;<a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/supreme-courts-hobby-lobby-ruling-means-for-them/653049/"" target=""_blank"">no company is trying to co-opt their hard-earned (and paid for) employee health insurance packages</a> as a platform for making all others abide by their scientifically-inaccurate religious beliefs on contraception.</p>
<p>But perhaps this divide is even more observed in the subtle day-to-day: While it’s an expectation for women to wear makeup to appear professional, put together and pretty (on a first date or otherwise), most men get by with running a comb through the hair and making their facial hair clean cut enough to look intentional.</p>
<p>If women don’t expect guys to amp up their appearance for a first date, why should we waste our time fretting over whether the man will appreciate our cat-eye eyeliner or not?</p>
<p>Be barefaced… because you know he will be.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/pixelated-hair-fashion-trend-never-expected/947180/,Beauty,Pixelated Hair Is The High-Tech Fashion Trend You Never Expected (Photos),"<p>Looking to change up your hair? Try <a href=""http://www.boredpanda.com/pixelated-hair-color-x-presion/"" target=""_blank"">pixelating</a> it.</p>
<p>Stamping your strands with colorful pixel patterns is the newest trend in hair color, and it’s unlike anything you’ve ever seen before.</p>
<p>Inspired by visual technology, the trend, pioneered by Madrid-based company X-Presion, has talented hair colorists dye a given section of hair in small, rectangular pieces to emulate the appearance of pixels on a screen.</p>
<p>Usually, the stylist will use several shades of the same color to achieve the dimensional dye job, but multiple colors can also be used.</p>
<p>Officially dubbed #xpresionpixel, the style, according to X-Presion rep Jorge Cancer, “was created by mistake,” but looked so cool, stylists “started to study” the accidental style to recreate it.</p>
<p>Cancer promises pixelated hair “is really easy to maintain,” but the style should only be attempted by a trained hairstylist.</p>
<p>He says,</p>
<blockquote><p>You need to learn a few rules, otherwise it could be a big mess.</p></blockquote>
<p>It definitely looks too complicated to try at home, but if you’re bored with your ombre ends or your all-over color, pixel-printed hair may be the trend to try next.</p>
<p>Check out some photos of the innovative style below.</p>
<h2>Pixelated strands almost look three-dimensional.</h2>
<hr>
<h2>The tech-inspired style was created by accident.</h2>
<hr>
<h2>But stylists loved how it looked, so they learned to recreate it.</h2>
<hr>
<h2>You can use bright colors for the style…</h2>
<hr>
<h2>…or make use of&nbsp;grown-in roots.</h2>
<hr>
<h2>Try a small swatch…</h2>
<hr>
<h2>…or pixelate half of your head.</h2>
<hr>
<h2>Or just dye your bangs for a hint of the trendy style.</h2>
<hr>
<h2>No matter what you do, the unexpected look is so cool.</h2>
<hr>
<h2>And it’s unlike anything you’ve ever seen.</h2></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151237/Stocksy_txp5029b5aajuW000_Small_400364-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/12-things-that-my-imperfect-body-has-taught-me-about-myself/602806/,Beauty,12 Things That My Imperfect Body Has Taught Me About Myself,"<p>My body and I, we’ve seen our fair share of rain.</p>
<p>We’ve weathered the storms together, however begrudgingly, and sat side-by-side through some of life’s toughest surf. We’ve grinned and bore it, smiled and got along while the cameras flashed and then behind the scenes, we waged silent war against one another, sometimes with actions, but more often than not, with words.</p>
<p>We’ve toured the highs and lows together. We’ve been each other’s only confidant, worn the White Hat and been both enemy and friend. We’ve reconciled the fact that we won’t ever have the size 2 waist, done crunch and crunch, tried our best to stay far from body-shaming. And though sometimes we failed a lot and sometimes we failed only a little, we remembered that in the end, it’s still just about us.</p>
<p>Our relationships with our bodies is the first one we form, long before we take those amazing first glances at mom and dad just minutes after birth, long before we look into the eyes of a lover and find ourselves looking right back.</p>
<p>They’re the relationships we take for granted most, always looking back and saying, “I should have…” and “Why didn’t I…” when we had the chance. Our bodies are the <i>only</i> things keeping us above the ground rather than in it, or under it, or, well, off it.</p>
<p>Our bodies are our resting place, both in the beginning, the middle and the end. They are everything – and they are perfectly imperfect.</p>
<p>They’re so flawed, in fact, that we learn to love and hate the imperfections. We shudder and celebrate them, proud that we have six freckles in the shape of an “O” on our forearms, mortified that we have dimples at the base of our backs.</p>
<p>But these things, these little, small consistencies that bind us together, that make us who we are, that are the very essence of everything good and true and brave and smart and beautiful — they are the characteristics we find the hardest to embrace.</p>
<p>It’s easy to berate the qualities that we’re most haunted by, the ones we overanalyze in photos, stare disgustedly at in the mirror, reflexively reach for and withdraw from; our sparkling minds, fit to burst with expression and opinion, with poise and pity, our painstakingly created bodies, expertly crafted and passionately caressed from day one until day one million – these are worth celebrating. They’re worth being proud of.</p>
<p>Why? Because they’re ours.</p>
<hr>
<h2>My frizzy hair reminds me just how important it is to be free.</h2>
<p>On humid days, I curse the heat and the way my mane so shamelessly shrivels up into a nappy mess on the back of my head. I hate that the bigger it gets, the smaller I feel.</p>
<p>At the same time, I want to applaud its unruly nature, how it strays from the status quo, how it is <i>nothing</i> like any other head of hair I’ve seen on the subway, the street, the sidewalk, the park.</p>
<p>Much as I try to, it isn’t tied down (or tied up), constrained, held down or buried behind anyone or anything. It is entirely its own, free to blow, flow and mangle itself any which way it wants.</p>
<hr>
<h2>My laugh lines remind me how hard I’ve laughed and how much I’ve smiled.</h2>
<p>They are a reminder of every good, funny, hysterical and happy thing that has happened to me both then and now and much as I might find myself fretting over how they look in pictures, or if they give me Bitchy Resting Face, I know that these lines are the very essence of my beauty.</p>
<p>They reflect just how often I’ve smiled when I could have cried, how often I’ve laughed instead of falling straight to pieces and just how many times I’ve let hysterical tears guide me toward happiness and out of an endless wading pool of misery.</p>
<hr>
<h2>These narrow shoulders are strong enough to carry the weight of the world.</h2>
<p>Day in and day out, the stresses of both the small and big picture sit comfortably perched on my shoulders and though giving in and letting it swallow me whole is always an option, the strength of these narrow little shoulders persists.</p>
<p>They are strong enough and secure enough to keep me afloat, even when I can’t swim, even when I’m tired of trying. They are my security, my strength.</p>
<hr>
<h2>My love handles remind me that there’s <i>always</i> more to love – even when you can’t see it.</h2>
<p>Tucked neatly inside a well-loved pair of high-waisted jeans, no one ever has to see ‘em, but I know they’re there.</p>
<p>And though every day is a constant battle between all of the pizza and cheese and pasta and bread I <i>want</i> to eat, I know exactly where they’ll go the minute they leave my lips.</p>
<p>But I also know that, sometimes, the things you can’t see are the things you learn to love most. So I treasure the secret, hidden parts of my body, knowing that some day I will revel in just how perfect I was, back when I didn’t even know it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>These flabby arms are strong enough to hold me up, even on my weakest days.</h2>
<p>They hold up grocery bags, they hold back my hair after a night of one too many, they lift weights, they load, unload and reload laundry, they move boxes, they hold friends, they hold strangers, they hold tightly on to lovers – but most importantly, they keep me up, even when I’m at rock bottom, even when I’m at my lowest. They always seems strong enough to keep <i>me</i> up.</p>
<hr>
<h2>My thicker thighs keep me rooted to the ground.</h2>
<p>The world is tough. There’s so much to see, to discover, to lose, to gain. These legs, no matter how big, no matter how small, no matter how strong or weak… they keep me firmly planted, two feet on the ground.</p>
<p>They make sure I only go where I want to go – they never take me further than the path that takes me home.</p>
<hr>
<h2>My stomach is the only place beer, cheese, wine, tequila and pasta coincide together peacefully.</h2>
<p>Some days it’s five pounds too much, others it’s five pounds too little (just kidding, I never have that problem), but my stomach, my tummy, my beer belly, whatever you wish to call it, is the only place on this earth where every one of my favorite food groups, no matter how good or bad for me they may be, can live in harmony and equilibrium. What about that <i>isn’t</i> worth celebrating?</p>
<hr>
<h2>These undefined abs have endured morning-after pukes, body shots, crop tops and thousands and thousands of crunches – and yet still, they want more.</h2>
<p>And yet somehow, through all of that, they manage to be better, stronger, flatter and flabbier than I ever thought possible. The fact that they continue to allow me the opportunity to fail, succeed, start over and try again is amazing.</p>
<hr>
<h2>My wide feet help me stay balanced, even when I’m scared I might topple over.</h2>
<p>They dodge curve ball after curve ball; they duck and cover when it comes to life’s craziest lunges – and surprisingly enough, they keep me here, on both feet, standing tall (even when I want to shrink into my toes).</p>
<p>They keep me upright, erect – they give me the courage to stand my ground – there are no other feet on this earth made explicitly for my very wear and tear.</p>
<hr>
<h2>These smaller-than-C-cup boobs are just a reminder that good things come in small packages.</h2>
<p>Diamonds, macaroons, mac-n-cheese bites, pizza bagels, just-because greeting cards — they’re all little reminders of just how <i>good</i> things really are. I’m pleased, time and time again, to remember that I don’t need a D-cup to remind myself of this.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<hr>
<h2>This brain, however inclined to point out failure and to highlight imperfection, is the home of my bravery, my intelligence, my humor, my passions, my excitement and my drive.</h2>
<p>It is the birth place of <i>every</i> good, bad, dangerous, creative, inspiring, silly, dumb and passionate idea I’ve ever had. It is the meeting point of emotion and action, it is where my feelings manifest themselves, the place my decisions embark from.</p>
<p>It is the only place where I am both the most incredibly brilliant person I have ever met and the most perpetually confused person I have ever laid eyes on. It is my Maker. And it is genius.</p>
<hr>
<h2>More important than anything, it’s totally and completely mine.</h2>
<p>This one very big and very little body, the gatekeeper to my thoughts, ideas, beliefs, insecurities, confusions, realities, organs, veins, blood and beauty, is mine. Just mine. It belongs to no one else, was made for <i>only</i> my use, made to endure my failures and successes, my bravery and my stupidity.</p>
<p>It is the most beautiful gift I have ever been endowed with. It is also the most terrifying. And it was then, is now and forever will be, the most perfectly imperfect amalgamation of me to exist, which makes it pretty damn cool.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/butt-implant-operations-increased-2014/954064/,Beauty,Baby Got Back: Butt Implant Operations Increased By 98 Percent In 2014,"<p>Chalk it up to “Anaconda,” Kim K’s infamous Paper magazine <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/topic/kim-kardashian-internet/"" target=""_blank"">shoot</a> and Vogue’s “Era of the Big Booty” article: 2014 saw a 98 percent <a href=""http://www.complex.com/style/2015/03/butt-implant-surgery-rose-dramatically-in-2014-more-than-13000-operations?utm_campaign=complexmag%2Bsocialflow%2B03%2B2015&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social"" target=""_blank"">rise in implants</a> to the derrière.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons released its <a href=""http://www.plasticsurgery.org/Documents/news-resources/statistics/2014-statistics/cosmetic-procedure-trends-2014.pdf"" target=""_blank"">annual report</a>&nbsp;— compiled from 953 surgical groups — totaling&nbsp;body modification procedures and trends for the year.</p>
<p>Even though&nbsp;surgeons performed the ever-popular breast augmentation only one percent less in 2014 than the year before, butt-based procedures are truly becoming a rival.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only implants, either. The&nbsp;ASPS reports a 15 percent rise in fat-graft booty augmentations&nbsp;while the famed butt lift saw a boost of 44 percent. And there’s been a 158 percent increase in butt lifts since the year 2000.</p>
<p>Scot Glasberg, ASPS&nbsp;president, <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/02/27/thanks-kim-nicki-iggy-and-jlo-love-plastic-surgeons-everywhere/"" target=""_blank"">told</a> the Washington Post the increase in procedures is almost certainly due to celebrity influence. He said,</p>
<blockquote><p>The media effect, Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez, are having a phenomenal effect on what patients want, what they are coming in and asking for.</p></blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind, however, it’s all relative to trends that have been in style longer, like liposuction.</p>
<p>Out of the roughly 1,678,000 procedures performed in 2014, butt enhancements only made up a&nbsp;scant&nbsp;16,873.</p>
<p>But, that’s really no surprise because procedures can reportedly cost upward of $7,o00.</p>
<p>Baby&nbsp;got back, well, more accurately, baby&nbsp;<em>purchased&nbsp;</em>back.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151406/Stocksy_txpf0c10511xfW000_Small_476491-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/photo-series-depicting-women-with-armpit-hair-looks-to-change-the-standards-of-beauty/,Beauty,Photographer Aims To Change The Standards Of Beauty By Shooting Women With Armpit Hair (Photos),"<p>Some may call it gross, others call it liberating. But whatever your initial opinion, this new photo series that features women with full-grown armpit hair is provocative, and makes the viewer think about what we define as our traditional standards of beauty.</p>
<p>As some commercials like to reinforce, men and women alike tend to observe that <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/misogynistic-ad-claims-dont-shave-legs-one-youll-turn-dude/"" target=""_blank"">hairlessness for the ladies is the normal sign of beauty</a>.</p>
<p>But London-based artist Ben Hopper is calling into question these ideas with his latest photo series, <a href=""http://www.policymic.com/articles/87151/photographer-uses-female-body-hair-to-challenge-traditional-beauty-standards"" target=""_blank"">Natural Beauty</a>. He asked friends, models, and other women to participate in the black-and-white pictures by growing out their armpit hair to be photographed.</p>
<blockquote><p>“‘Natural Beauty’ could be classified as a type of protest. By creating a contrast between common ‘fashionable’ female beauty and the raw unconventional look of female armpit hair, thoughts are intrigued and a discussion is made.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Although the reactions to his photos have so far been mixed, Hopper said it’s the dialogue around how women and others dictate beauty standards for the female body that he wants to encourage and maybe even change.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/long-hair-vs-short-hair/961757/,Beauty,"Short Hair, Don’t Care: 7 Awesome Reasons To Chop Off Your Locks","<p>We’ve all had moments of not being able to&nbsp;tolerate our long hair anymore, but we still love how it looks.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, sometimes we choose to&nbsp;chop it off and we feel born again, even though we may feel like we just committed a <del>capital sin</del>&nbsp;huge mistake.</p>
<h2>Either way, here are some perks of cutting almost all your hair off so you can rock your short hair look:</h2>
<hr>
<h2>You will start saving money on&nbsp;shampoo.</h2>
<p>This will not only benefit your wallet, but it will also reduce the time you spend washing your hair. Less hair, less shampoo, less time showering and more time to do everything else&nbsp;you want.</p>
<p>You now can even afford a super expensive shampoo that will last months, so every penny will be worth it. And, let’s not forget&nbsp;how much less you’ll have to&nbsp;wash your hair.</p>
<hr>
<h2>You will save in practically&nbsp;<em>every </em>hair product.</h2>
<p>You no longer have Rapunzel’s hair, so you don’t have to buy that detangling spray or that special treatment you used so your hair wouldn’t have broken ends.</p>
<p>Now, you can practically not use any of them because of the micro haircut with which you are stuck, no matter if it’s a pixie cut or a bob. Used your saved money to buy anything else.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Your can freely wear sticky lip gloss or any kind of lip gloss.</h2>
<p>Isn’t it annoying how your hair feels automatically attracted to your lips,&nbsp;especially&nbsp;when you are using those amazing Victoria’s Secret sticky, scented and sexy lip glosses?</p>
<p>Don’t even get me started when you step out and a gush of wind traps your hair in your mouth.</p>
<p>When this happens, it&nbsp;in no way looks sexy, like in&nbsp;those TV commercials. With short hair, you don’t have to worry about this&nbsp;at all.</p>
<hr>
<h2>You don’t have to worry about accidentally shoving your hair into your food (and later your mouth).</h2>
<p>When your hair goes beyond your boobs, you know you will live eternally with the risk of eating your own hair or staining it with your food.</p>
<p>Even the food crumbs are your worst enemy because you don’t know if that teeny-tiny crumb of garlic bread will fall prisoner to&nbsp;your mane, which will make you look like&nbsp;you don’t know how to eat because you end up with food in your hair.</p>
<p>By having a cute short cut, you will win at eating any and every food.</p>
<hr>
<h2>When you have sex you won’t suffocate the other person.</h2>
<p>With short hair, you won’t do any sexy hair flipping while having sex. Instead, you’ll just&nbsp;be able to concentrate on doing the deed.</p>
<p>When you have long hair, you have to be careful not to bring your hair into your partners mouth or all over his body, and doing this&nbsp;consumes so much energy that you are constantly taking out your hair of the way.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Your shower drains are eternally thankful of the lack of hair balls after every bath.</h2>
<p>After a long-haired shower, you have to remove&nbsp;all the excess of hair, which is disgusting.</p>
<p>When your&nbsp;hair barely reaches your collarbone, the amount of hair chunks that you will shed (yes, just like a dog) is minimal, nearly nothing, in fact.</p>
<hr>
<h2>You can try different do’s for your hair,&nbsp;which will look completely cool.</h2>
<p>You can braid your hair, straighten it, do it&nbsp;like Miley Cyrus (if you are very adventurous) and&nbsp;all will look very unique.</p>
<p>You can basically even not do anything to your hair, wake up, get dressed, perhaps apply a little makeup and be on your way.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you have either&nbsp;long or short hair, you learn to live with it and you should definitely switch your look every now and then. It will be like a fresh start into something.</p>
<p>You may hate you that you changed it and even wish that you had never decided to&nbsp;chop it off, but with time, you will start loving every inch of it. So, enjoy and experiment&nbsp;with it.</p>
<p>After all, it grows back eventually, so it’s not a permanent choice.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151354/Stocksy_txpa92d3c793gW000_Small_338631-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/need-know-anti-aging-products/1036852/,Beauty,10 Things Every 20-Something Should Know About Anti-Aging Products,"<p>Our early 20s are full of changes. We graduate. We move to new cities. We meet new friends. We date new people.</p>
<p>We replace bodycon skirts with pencil skirts. It can be a tough time, but overall, they’re relatively good changes.</p>
<p>But there’s been one not-so-good change: our skin.</p>
<p>As we age, it doesn’t bounce back like it used to. If we have too much to drink, our faces take a solid day to look healthy again.</p>
<p>You thought you’d skip through life never&nbsp;having to deal with acne? Well, now you get a zit at least once every week.</p>
<p>Waking up at 7 am every day brings dark circles even the best concealer can’t hide.</p>
<p>And, though they might not be noticeable to anyone except ourselves, we’re definitely starting to sprout wrinkles.</p>
<p>Still quite terrified of the aging process in general, we have a million questions running through our heads. (Which is probably going to cause more creases…)</p>
<p><em>Were we supposed to start using anti-aging products five years ago? What does a 25-year-old truly need when it comes to anti-aging products? Will I actually stop looking this way soon?</em></p>
<p>Thankfully, Dr. Jessica Weiser from the New York Dermatology Group was quick to answer our concerns.</p>
<h2>1. Don’t buy products based on price.</h2>
<p>Dr. Weiser says, “The active ingredients determine the efficacy of these products,” so don’t go wasting one month’s rent on the latest miracle cream. Instead, decide what your skin needs and check the back of the product instead of its pricetag.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. There are specific ingredients 20-somethings&nbsp;should look for in anti-aging creams, lotions and serums.</h2>
<p>Just like haircare or the best wardrobe for your body, the anti-aging routine differs for everyone.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to brighten your skin by removing the general gunk from the surface, Weiser suggests simply exfoliating twice a week.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something to&nbsp;reverse the damage already done to your skin, look for antioxidant-based products and ones made with hyaluronic acid.</p>
<p>Retinol can also be incorporated into your skin care routine at any age, as long as it’s used in a very small amount.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. If you want to splurge on something, look for a “good quality antioxidant-rich serum.”</h2>
<p>Weiser suggests <a href=""http://www.skinceuticals.com/c-e-ferulic-635494263008.html"" target=""_blank"">Skinceutical CE ferulic serum</a> because it provides protection against free radicals in the environment, keeping your skin “healthy and radiant.” And isn’t that all we really want? (Yes.)</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Starting the anti-aging process early isn’t bad, just be careful of what you’re using.</h2>
<p>If you want to avoid wrinkles for as long as possible, feel free to start using anti-aging products the minute you get home from work today. Just be informed about what you’re putting on your skin.</p>
<p>For instance, the previously-mentioned retinol can cause “excessive irritation, redness and dryness” if it’s used too much, but a “collagen-stimulating retinol will help stimulate collagen production,” advises Weiser.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. Yes, sunscreen is crucial.</h2>
<p>Yep, we’ll <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/life/scary-facts-fake-tanning-women-need-know/1001201/"" target=""_blank"">say it&nbsp;again</a>:&nbsp;Stay out of the sun. When asked for the one thing she wanted 20-somethings to know about anti-aging products, Weiser answered with “sunscreen.”</p>
<p>Wear sunscreen every single day, multiple times a day.</p>
<p>Tanning and smoking are two of the biggest contributors to fine lines and wrinkles.</p>
<p>No anti-aging miracle cream will replace UV protection, and you might love your tan now, but you’ll regret it in a couple years.</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. More isn’t always better for your skin.</h2>
<p>Don’t buy every item you see because each promises a different kind of flawless skin. Instead, choose one or two that work best for you; they’re likely just as efficient — maybe&nbsp;even more so than countless creams and serums.</p>
<p>This rule will keep you from overdoing it and drying out your skin in the process.</p>
<hr>
<h2>7. Anti-aging serums and anti-aging creams are not the same things.</h2>
<p>We know, we know: It’s confusing to remember which anti-aging product does what. Here’s a helpful hint: If you’re looking for nourishment and hydration, go with a cream.</p>
<p>Serums, on the other hand, are “highly concentrated delivery products packed with active ingredients in small molecules so they are able to penetrate into the skin,” according to Weiser.</p>
<hr>
<h2>8. You’ll probably need to change your routine as you get older.</h2>
<p>Maybe you’re worried about wrinkles now, but in 15 years, sunspots might be your biggest enemy. Again, it’s a very individualized process, so Weiser warns your skin and the product regimen should “change to reflect new symptoms of aging.”</p>
<hr>
<h2>9. Botox will not solve all of your problems.</h2>
<p>Planning on tanning and casually smoking your way through your 20s because you have Botox and filler injections to rely on? You might want to rethink your grand&nbsp;plan.</p>
<p>Sure, this procedure will certainly get rid of some wrinkles, but in the long run, it’s best to use a well-rounded skincare treatment to keep your skin healthy.</p>
<hr>
<h2>10. Some anti-aging products are good to use in the morning, others aren’t.</h2>
<p>A lightweight lotion with SPF should be your go-to choice in the morning if you have oily skin.</p>
<p>If your face tends to be dry or sensitive, it’ll benefit from “a more active protective barrier to the skin” applied at night, says Weiser.</p>
<p>If the product increases your sensitivity to the sun, or it’s negatively affected by UV rays, use it at bedtime.</p>
<p>Some serums and creams are good to use two times a day, but you can still see results (and save some money) with once a day application.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151354/Stocksy_txpc420a643hnW000_Small_503450-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/plus-size-woman-photoshopped-different-cultures/880030/,Beauty,Plus-Size Woman Gets Photoshopped Based On 21 Cultures’ Idea Of Beauty (Photos),"<p>Another day, another Photoshop challenge.</p>
<p>We’ve seen what happens when strangers are asked to Photoshop a woman they’ve never met based on their ideal of beauty — on more than one occasion, actually — but Marie Southard Ospina’s <a href=""http://www.bustle.com/articles/52018-i-asked-21-photoshop-experts-from-around-the-world-to-make-me-a-plus-size-woman-beautiful"" target=""_blank"">Photoshop challenge</a> is a bit different than any we’ve seen before.</p>
<p>Similar to the past experiments (the first conducted by <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/envision/woman-photoshops-her-headshot-to-portray-the-standard-of-beauty-in-25-different-countries/646658/"" target=""_blank"">Esther Honig</a>&nbsp;and the second by journalist <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/envision/woman-color-asked-people-around-world-photoshop-look-beautiful-photos/743459/"" target=""_blank"">Pricilla Yuki Wilson</a>), Ospina asked strangers around the world to edit a photograph of her to make her what they would consider “beautiful.”</p>
<p>What differs from the previous challenges is that Ospina identifies herself as plus-size, adding a new, unaddressed element to the table.</p>
<p>Ospina admits that her take on the social beautifying experiment was influenced by both Honig and Wilson, as well as by her own knowledge about the Ugandan Hima Tribe, in which “being fat is still considered a sign of prosperity, health, wealth, and/or grace.”</p>
<p>Ospina explains,</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m…aware that the notion ‘thin is the <em>only</em> beautiful’ doesn’t permeate the entirety of the world… So, inspired by Honig and Yuki, and my own perceptions of weight and beauty, I decided to replicate their original experiments&nbsp;— with a plus-sized twist.</p></blockquote>
<p>She sent out an untouched, makeup-free portrait of herself to 21 Photoshop experts around the globe.</p>
<p>Below, you’ll see what they chose to do.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/thoughts-girls-head-sephora/776112/,Beauty,Is Beauty Pain? 16 Questions Every Girl Asks Herself While Shopping At Sephora,"<p>Sephora is like the retail equivalent of a boyfriend for every girl — it’s there for you on bad days when you just want to get lost for a while, it’s got everything you need to feel beautiful and no matter what, you somehow end up spending way more time and money than you originally planned.</p>
<p>When shoes are too expensive and trying on clothes sounds too frightening, Sephora is the place for a quick purchase pick-me-up. A new lipstick is instant gratification. Nail polish is a collector’s item. These are our thrills and they need no explanation.</p>
<p>BRB, we’re getting high just thinking about that Prada Candy perfume and vibrating YSL mascara. You know you shouldn’t, but you’re going to anyway because, to quote “American Beauty<em>,”</em> “Sometimes there’s so much beauty [products] in the world, I feel like I can’t take it, and my heart is just going to cave in.”</p>
<p>Or something like that. Here are all the thoughts that go through a girl’s head when she’s in Sephora.</p>
<h2>1. Do they know I’m not actually going to buy anything?</h2>
<p>It was really nice shmearing this $95 BB cream all over my face, though. Thank you and I <em>will</em> come again.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. Why do they make orange lipstick?</h2>
<p>Why is this blue? Why does this look very passable, though?</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. How do you open this?</h2>
<p>Beware: If you draw attention to yourself, a salesperson will approach you and question why you’ve been there for close to an hour. Quickly conceal all traces of bronzer on your face.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Do I really need a case of four lip glosses?</h2>
<p>Long Answer: If you put one in your bag for like, every day, then you have one for going out, one for fun days and one to lose immediately in a jacket pocket. Or you could give one to <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/big-sister-made-for-you/698206/"" target=""_blank"">your sister</a>, who would appreciate anything you give her. Short answer: Yes, yes you do.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. Am I going to contract an eye infection?</h2>
<p>Was that brush germ-free? Because I am not finding disinfectant cleaner <em>anywhere.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>6. Will she ever move out of the way of the mirror?</h2>
<p>There should be lanes and time limits, like a gym for applying makeup.</p>
<hr>
<h2>7. (While deciding on “Better Than Sex” mascara) I am a sucker for marketing</h2>
<p>I’m probably going to buy “Orgasm” blush, too. Because I need it, okay?</p>
<hr>
<h2>8. Is the Sephora brand really that bad?</h2>
<p>This gold eyeliner is $10. F*ck it.</p>
<hr>
<h2>9. Am I below stealing the tester?</h2>
<p>Bad question. What you should be asking yourself is, <em>“Is it gross to steal the tester?”</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>10. Why make an eyeshadow palette with four colors when two of them are clearly colors no one would ever wear?</h2>
<p>What to do when the NARS eye-quad is more like an eye-half because you don’t wear mauve eyeshadow and shudder at the thought of sea green. An investment piece?</p>
<hr>
<h2>11. Should I start working here?</h2>
<p>It would score me some serious discounts. And one fewer points-card to sign up for.</p>
<hr>
<h2>12. I might smell like a Russian bathhouse?</h2>
<p>That’s what you get when you go H.A.M. in the perfume section.</p>
<hr>
<h2>13. Why does this Christian Louboutin nail polish cost me an arm, a leg and my Loubs?</h2>
<p>They carry $50 nail polish, but they don’t carry MAC.</p>
<hr>
<h2>14. What’s the difference between lip crayon and lip marker?</h2>
<p>Both sound like painting my face like a kindergartener.</p>
<hr>
<h2>15. Why. Are. There. So. Many. Colors?</h2>
<p>I’m overwhelmed. Sephora is turning on me!</p>
<p>Deep breaths. Ooh, contour powder!</p>
<hr>
<h2>16. If I ask for enough samples, I won’t have to purchase it, right?</h2>
<p>I shouldn’t feel bad because Sephora is, like, mass-produced and on every street corner and suburban mall that’s doing reasonably okay.</p>

<p>The pillow is the final product of the horrifyingly crafty work of <a href=""http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Out-Practice-Pillow-for-Valentines-Day/?ALLSTEPS"" target=""_blank"">Emily Grace King at Instructables</a>, who generously provides a step-by-step tutorial should you want to make-out with Freddy Krueger instead of a real person.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you are still in middle school, King suggests using this pillow as a kissing aid; kind of like practicing making out on your hand except way, way creepier.</p>
<p>The makeout pillow dismembers the mouth from a CPR practice doll and then attaches it to a fluffy pillow to create a some sort of “Buried Alive” horror. King also mentions that she <a href=""http://www.neatorama.com/2014/02/11/How-to-Make-a-Make-Out-Practice-Pillow/#!voUAv"" target=""_blank"">found her materials</a> by a dumpster, so that seems healthy.</p>
<p>Who wants a whole boyfriend when all you really need is a mouth?</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/these-ads-show-the-madness-perpetuated-by-our-beauty-standards-photos/661720/,Beauty,These Ads Perfectly Capture The ‘Madness’ Of Beauty Standards For Women (Photos),"<p>There’s a new trend in ads targeting women: Instead of appealing to their shopping prowess in an attempt to get them to buy certain products, advertisers and brands are going more inspirational and empowering route to get women’s attention.</p>
<p>First there was the “<a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/sorry-im-sorry-women-need-stop-apologizing-general/643454/"" target=""_blank"">Sorry Not Sorry</a>” ad reminding women to apologize less, followed by the “<a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/psychological-effect-likeagirl/654532/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=psychological-effect-likeagirl"" target=""_blank"">Like a Girl</a>” commercial that set out to prove how girls are just as good as the guys.</p>
<p>Now this “<a href=""http://www.stopthebeautymadness.com/"" target=""_blank"">Stop the Beauty Madness</a>” campaign has jumped on the bandwagon, producing images that seek to show women that their value isn’t tied to looking better.</p>
<p>Taking on moronic trends like the “thigh gap,” the 25-ad series seeks to highlight the “madness” that’s involved in determining and meeting these unattainable beauty standards.</p>
<p>And rather than just criticizing the way we’ve come to assess beauty, the “Stop the Beauty Madness” questions the overwhelming value that we put on beauty in the first place.</p>
<p>Robin Rice, the founder of this project, said she wanted to pursue this provocative idea to challenge how women have become so concerned with the superficial standards, instead of the important stuff.</p>
<blockquote><p>My main mission is to say if women are worried about their weight and their looks to the point that they’re not actually putting themselves in the world, then we’re missing out on some really extraordinary individuals and some really important conversations we need to be having.</p>
<p>Women need to be helping the world move in a more beautiful direction — a genuinely beautiful direction.</p></blockquote>
<p>These ads are a reminder of just how diverse and different women can be, and make its viewers focus on the innate instead of the artificial.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/the-connection-between-taking-selfies-and-a-healthier-body-image-for-women/,Beauty,#NoFilter: The Connection Between Taking Selfies And A Healthier Body Image For Women,"<p>Ellen DeGeneres’s <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/entertainment/celebrity/ellen-attempts-take-retweeted-photo-time-biggest-faces-hollywood/"" target=""_blank"">epic selfie</a> proved what sexting teenagers and the Oxford Dictionary already knew: We are living in the Era of the Selfie.</p>
<p>Nearly every phone is manufactured with a camera that can now automatically face towards you and there’s even <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/envision/selfie-queen-the-next-level-way-to-selfie-like-a-pro/"" target=""_blank"">special equipment</a> to ease the stress of having to cram all your friends in at only an arm’s length. We use them in advertisements, as fodder on Snapchat and in place of emojis to communicate our feelings to friends. The selfie has become integral to a family vacation album or excursion some place. Cher Horowitz’s signature technique of using Polaroids instead of mirrors just got a major upgrade now that we have smartphones.</p>
<p>There are two types of selfies: the Ellen DeGeneres kind that draws your attention away from the person in the camera and the more personal kind that directs your focus on the person up-close through the lens. Both invite you in, but the former makes an outside audience privy to an intimacy only the mirror could previously&nbsp;see.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Tumblrs and Instagrams of the world, viewing images of a wide array of women’s bodies via their uploaded selfies has become extremely easy and quite casual. We can scroll through a friend’s Facebook page that’s populated with full-body mirror photos at the gym or the head-to-toe looks from a budding fashionista. Regardless of what we are scanning, there’s always one common theme: a woman’s body.</p>
<p>For once, putting a woman’s body on display does not spell doom for the female gender. In fact, our selfies are actually a way of proliferating body acceptance. We’re now witnessing real girls from all different angles, perspectives, shapes and sizes. They’re on the beach, on the streets or just in their bathrooms. The more pedestrian the setting, the more accustomed we’ll become to seeing authentic women in a bona fide way.</p>
<p>What we may not realize is that selfies are powerful. As <a href=""http://nymag.com/thecut/2012/09/body-acceptance-in-the-age-of-the-selfie.html"" target=""_blank"">NYMag’s The Cut</a> eloquently breaks down, “They’re poorly lit; they’re self-staged. Not only is there no airbrushing, but there’s no flattering lighting, no strategic body positions. They underscore the message of her accompanying words. They say, <em>Here’s me. Just me</em>.”</p>
<p>Look no further than the many female celebrities who are choosing to bare themselves — no makeup, naked or otherwise — for phones instead of photographers. Part of the reason we’re much more fascinated by their selfies than their glossies is that they’re raw; they strip away the Hollywood and put a celeb back in a more relatable, natural state. When these starlets showcase their imperfections, they’re simultaneously redefining what we consider to be flaws. Let’s face it: We can all can sleep better at night knowing Kate Moss has cellulite.</p>
<p>All personal annoyances aside, we’re able to see Kim Kardashian confidently <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/entertainment/celebrity/kim-kardashian-posts-selfie-joins-the-hottest-milfs-club/"" target=""_blank"">flaunt her voluptuous curves</a> without the E! cameras editing her in post-production. Kim doesn’t fit the size two mold and she’s not ashamed of it, but more importantly, neither is her audience. This is how she is choosing to present herself, and despite being a fake person, there’s something very genuine about that. We can at least embrace this act of sincerity in Kim and other celebrities.</p>
<p>Social media is a haven for us to unabashedly and shamelessly put ourselves out there — usually for the validation from “likes” and feedback from friends and strangers. It would be fitting, then, that uploading selfies is an expression of this self-acceptance: You promote your real features in a positive light and random people voluntarily approve of both your self-confidence and appearance. We’re sending a message that says, “Yes, you are nice to look at.”</p>
<p>Take weight loss blogs and photo series, for example. We’re posting images of bodies that aren’t normally depicted in public, unless you’re watching a gruesome TLC special. These selfies, by contrast, are body-positive; that the female anatomy is beautiful at any weight and we should get used to seeing it that way. With all the Lena Dunhams and Robyn Lawleys of the world, it seems we just might be.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note, however, this meta phenomenon that is simultaneously happening: Are we, the users, now employing these bare selfies as yet another masked advertisement, for our own female nudity? Is this really us taking control of our bodies or are we putting them on display for others to judge?</p>
<p>Think about the sexy, often naked selfies both young and old girls (remember <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/entertainment/celebrity/newsroom-actress-alison-pill-accidentally-tweets-topless-photo/"" target=""_blank"">Alison Pill</a>?) send to their lovers and friends. Are these promoting body acceptance or something else?</p>
<p>I ask this not to make us question whether these racy selfies are “good” or “bad,” but rather to point out that not all selfies are meant for public consumption, and thus, this selfie exists for a very different reason. Perhaps if we saw more of these naked selfies — like how British magazines display a woman’s nipples — pornography wouldn’t be such a taboo. But I digress…</p>
<p>There is also the question of filters. Do these undermine the body acceptance selfie movement? Using a preset option to enhance your tan, contour a leg or hide some blemishes definitely doesn’t sound certified organic, but then again, who can really tell the difference? If you’re bold enough to flash some selfie — much like your size — it shouldn’t matter how it’s packaged.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, it’s comforting and refreshing to see so many gorgeous, amazing women flaunting their bodies, their selfies, for the rest of us to praise on social media. It’s not wrong to be proud of yourself and your shape; it’s wrong not to accept it.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/women-vontouring-contouring-vaginas/1117396/,Beauty,"Women Are Now ‘Vontouring’ Their Vaginas, And We Literally Cannot","<p>Women are always being told there is something wrong with the way they look, and vaginas are no exception to the long list of things women have to improve.</p>
<p>In that light, there’s now a <a href=""http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/news/a43591/great-now-people-are-contouring-their-vaginas/"" target=""_blank"">medical procedure</a> using “intensive heating” to “correct the external look of vagina.”</p>
<p>Vontouring (officially called <a href=""http://www.freyaestetica.com/index.php/en/services/non-invasive-labioplasty-prot-g-intima"" target=""_blank"">Protégé Intima</a>) works as a non-invasive, non-surgical labioplasty that increases the flexibility of the labia major and minora, therefore causing a “significant and long-lasting improvement of sexual satisfaction.”</p>
<p>While I think it’s great for women to be able to do whatever it takes to make them feel beautiful, I can’t fathom anyone wanting to undergo that kind of pain just because her vagina looks the way a vagina is supposed to look.</p>
<p>In fact, I have a feeling most guys wouldn’t even be able to tell the difference between a regular vagina and a Vontoured one.</p>
<p>Besides, I’d like to see any man burn his dick to make sex more pleasurable for women.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/countoring_elitedaily-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/keeping-us-warm-winning-at-movember-these-are-things-that-hairy-men-are-good-for/,Beauty,"Keeping Us Warm, Winning At Movember: These Are Things That Hairy Men Are Good For","<p>Okay, so I have another confession to make. On top of <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/everything-you-need-to-know-about-dating-a-30-year-old-man-as-a-20-something-girl/"" target=""_blank"">swooning over older guys</a>, I’m pretty much obsessed with bearded men — not just bearded men, but hairy men… like, the whole friggin’ package: back, crack, even the sac. I’m totally hooked.</p>
<p>Aside from being obviously smokin’ hot, hairy men arouse this kind of carnal desire that is really borderline animalistic, which makes sense based on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection_in_human_evolution"" target=""_blank"">theories of sexual selection</a>: in prehistoric times, women were more strongly attracted to masculine-looking men (i.e. broad shoulders, large chest, hair) because it was a sign of fertility and health. (Sigh, if only mating were that simple now…) The evolutionary version of myself probably went nuts over these virile beasts and now, present-day me is stuck with this stache-loving heart.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that hairless men aren’t sexy, either. Ryan Lochte shaves his entire body to swim in the Olympics and I ain’t complaining! A clean-shaven look after weeks of scruff can be rather dashing (not to mention, a nice break from the beard-burn post-makeout sesh).</p>
<p>Let’s not forget about all the other glorious places men have hair, too, starting with my personal favorite: the chest.</p>
<p>Warning: The content you are about to read contains explicit language, strong sexual suggestions and is intended for mature audiences only. And maybe if you’re my dad you should stop reading here altogether.</p>
<p>The excitement I get when I unbutton a man’s oxford shirt to reveal a luscious thicket of chest hair can only be compared to that special feeling you get when you open a Chinese takeout bag and find an extra bag of crunchy noodles.</p>
<p>I want to do dirty, filthy things to this man’s chest, like give it a rubdown with my tongue and gently tug at the fistful in my hands. Seriously, if I could cover my walls in chest hair just so I could nuzzle against it while lying in bed, I would. And I’m fully aware of how odd that sounds.</p>
<p>There’s something deeply comforting about having a bearish-like man envelop you in a hug. Back hair is an added bonus to round out the entire package; it’s a sign of maturity, the antithesis to the prepubescent Justin Biebers of the world. And I cannot get enough of it.</p>
<p>Just because I already promised you that we’re going to go there, I have no qualms about hairy testicles, either. They’re like stuffed animals, really. They’re soft and fun to play with, and if one happens to casually go in my mouth (kids will put anything in their mouths), it’s toxic-free!</p>
<p>This brings me to the issue of pubes. I’ve had guys tell me they shave theirs to make their ding-dongs look bigger. This pains me.</p>
<p>Your dick isn’t the Mona Lisa and the optical illusion you’re trying to achieve A) doesn’t work, and B) is really inconsiderate to the hair-lovers of the world, myself included.</p>
<p>Especially when the rest of your body is covered in hair, the absence of pubes just looks like negative space. To be fully candid, an extra set of Brillo padding isn’t going to deter me from going for it.</p>
<p>Hairy men are good for more than just their unparalleled sex appeal, jungle balls and getting slowed down by water. They bring lots of joy into my world, as well as those of others.</p>
<p>As if we needed further reason to love these smoldering beasts, here are more things a hairy man is good for:</p>
<h2>Winning at Movember</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #c0c0c0;""><a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;docid=Honqh9v9oLSORM&amp;tbnid=JaL0LNDTYBBgTM:&amp;ved=0CAQQjB0&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsplitend.net%2Fpage%2F2&amp;ei=XdXeUtGBDc3gsASW2YGACg&amp;bvm=bv.59568121,d.eW0&amp;psig=AFQjCNHCYc8ZjNrf-tx2-ONi_Lqzq4yJsA&amp;ust=1390421712988903"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #c0c0c0;"">Split End</span></a></span></p>
<p>They might have a competitive advantage due to their naturally thick follicles. Plus, they are more used to having an abundance of fluff on their faces than the average guy.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Keeping us warm</h2>
<p>Use their body as a blanket. Hairy men have more than enough tufts to go around and they’re way softer than a down comforter.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Looking like GQ models</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #c0c0c0;""><a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;docid=gyJqf5J7076pmM&amp;tbnid=TC1td2fkxaqCFM:&amp;ved=0CAQQjB0&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fweheartit.com%2Fentry%2F11633056&amp;ei=XtbeUsehGrKnsQSJrYDwBw&amp;bvm=bv.59568121,d.eW0&amp;psig=AFQjCNFWJ-HQKNFfY_fQOK_hKaHB4zJ2hg&amp;ust=1390421977011513"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #c0c0c0;"">We Heart It</span></a></span></p>
<p>Dayum, boys. Is it happy hour, yet? Because I can’t see anything but your five o’clock shadow.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Storing food for later</h2>
<p>I love a man who doesn’t let good food go to waste. How thoughtful of him to have a snack handy!</p>
<hr>
<h2>Locks of love</h2>
<p>Hmmm… maybe if they grew their beards to “Duck Dynasty” levels? Could be an interesting texture, that’s for sure.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Looking like hipsters</h2>
<p>Hipsters have cool style and about 96 percent of Brooklyn is attracted to them. They must be doing something right.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Sawing wood and lumberjacking</h2>
<p>Just humor me and play into the stereotype, okay?</p>
<hr>
<h2>Wildlife reserves</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #c0c0c0;""><a href=""http://dangerouscomplicity.tumblr.com/post/72344405611/patrik-j-by-fredrik-augustsson"" target=""_blank"">Dangerous Complicity</a></span></p>
<p>We’re animals, too!</p>
<hr>
<h2>Humidifying a room</h2>
<p>Hairy men sweat a lot more than the hairless cats of the world. Sleep next to one next time you feel stuffy.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Skinning</h2>
<p>How come no one has thought of this before?! I’d love a new pair of beard-lined Uggs.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/woman-hasnt-used-shampoo-six-years-hair-amazing/993268/,Beauty,Woman Hasn’t Used Shampoo In Six Years And Says Her Hair Is Amazing (Photos),"<p>As of late, the “no-poo” movement has been gaining serious traction in the beauty world.</p>
<p>For the unfamiliar, going “no-poo” (yes, I know, <em>poo</em>, ha-ha) is the practice of eliminating shampoo from the beauty routine, opting instead for cleansing conditioners, oils or, in some cases, nothing at all.</p>
<p>Sarah Theeboom, a writer at Time Out New York magazine (and a former colleague of mine) may well be one of the pioneers of the movement — and she <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3028968/Writer-shuns-shampoo-SIX-YEARS-admits-experience-isn-t-dirty-think.html?ito=social-facebook"" target=""_blank"">makes a damn good case</a> for ditching the TRESemmé.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with <a href=""http://www.seventeen.com"" target=""_blank"">Seventeen</a>, the New Yorker <a href=""http://www.seventeen.com/beauty/a29092/i-havent-shampooed-my-hair-in-six-years/"" target=""_blank"">revealed</a>&nbsp;she first gave up shampoo six years ago, following the lead of a friend with miraculously shiny, frizz-free locks.</p>
<p>Theeboom hoped changing her haircare routine so drastically would help revitalize her limp, greasy strands.</p>
<p>The first few weeks were, in a word, nightmarish, Theeboom recalls. Her scalp had become greasier than ever, and she’d developed a nasty case of dandruff.</p>
<p>She recalls,</p>
<blockquote><p>It was really unpleasant, and I was so embarrassed that I didn’t want to show my head to anyone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Still, she “felt committed” to forging ahead with her new, shampoo-free routine.</p>
<p>Theeboom added,</p>
<blockquote><p>Thankfully, it paid off: After 12&nbsp;grueling weeks, I started to see what my natural hair was like when I wasn’t constantly doing stuff to manipulate it. It was silky and wavier and totally frizz free.</p></blockquote>
<p>Six years later, Theeboom remains an impassioned advocate for her “poo-free” routine.</p>
<p>So if you’ve been considering going “no-poo,” know it will take time for your scalp to adjust to the change — but one glance at Theeboom’s gorgeous, shiny, healthy hair is proof the wait is worth it.</p>
<h2>“I don’t think shampoo is evil,” says Theeboom. “But I like my hair better this way.”</h2>
<hr>
<h2>She continues: “It looks and feels so much healthier. Plus, I save a lot of money…”</h2>

<h2>“…my hair is <em>free</em>, in every sense of the word.”</h2></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151033/Stocksy_txp8f72adb0mxW000_Small_658171-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/the-secret-to-figuring-out-whether-you-are-hot-or-beautiful-is-realizing-that-youre-already-both/,Beauty,The Secret To Figuring Out Whether You Are Hot Or Beautiful Is Realizing That You’re Already Both,"<p>Lately, I’ve seen a lot of “the difference between” articles. The difference between the <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/dating/women-marrying/"" target=""_blank"">people you date and the person you marry</a>, <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/the-actual-difference-between-women-who-are-hot-and-who-are-beautiful/"" target=""_blank"">the difference between someone who is beautiful and someone who is hot</a> — the list never ends. I’ve read a lot of these articles and, while I’ve understood many of the points they make, I’ve often felt that I qualify as both ends of the argument.</p>
<p>There are qualities I possess that make me every parent’s dream daughter-in-law — I’m motivated, educated and determined to make something of myself — but I’ve also danced atop many bars upon finishing finals.</p>
<p>A problem with these articles is that they force us to put ourselves in a box. They force us to ask ourselves which of two polar ideas we are without realizing we possess the ability to be both.</p>
<p>I actually loved the recent post about <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/the-actual-difference-between-women-who-are-hot-and-who-are-beautiful/"">the difference between being beautiful and being hot</a>. I loved that it supported women being loved and accepted in their own skin and that it exposed problems with a lot of current beauty trends.</p>
<p>We live in a world where we strive to meet unattainable image standards, surrounded by Photoshopped models and a constant internal struggle to fit in a cookie-cutter mold on which no woman should ever waste her energy.</p>
<p>I loved the points about men viewing women as beautiful rather than hot, but I couldn’t help but wonder if it’s so bad to want to feel hot every now and again. Not for the approval of someone else or to keep up with the latest trends, but simply because sometimes, it feels good to feel hot.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about whether or not I have to choose one or the other. Just like all of the other “difference between” articles, I feel as though it forces you to put yourself in one category or another. Decide not to shove yourself into a box and realize that you can have it all.</p>
<p>The truth is, you are both beautiful and hot. You can be hot anytime you want to be. We use celebrities, models and the popular girl in our Spanish class to define “hot” at the moment. Hot is a night out on the town with your ladies, wearing heels as tall as your hair is long and a dress that fits perfectly. Hot is knowing your best angle for a picture, using a filter because it makes you look tan and holding eye contact extra long with the cute guy across the bar.</p>
<p>As much as those things don’t define you or create anything more than an image, we all do them and I don’t consider it a negative thing. Sometimes a night of dancing makes you feel alive, and sometimes the perfect picture is the confidence boost you needed to get your groove back.</p>
<p>We all have moments when we want to feel hot: after a breakup, on a girl’s weekend in Vegas, or maybe even after watching the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. Hot is an image and it usually fades or changes with the season or ends up being something you look back on and say, “<em>W</em><i>hat was I thinking</i>?”</p>
<p>“Beautiful” is a state over which you have no control. It’s something that happens when you least expect it. It is the look in your eyes when you find something about which you are passionate, or tell someone you love him or her, or hear a song that gives you goosebumps.</p>
<p>Beautiful is your face in the morning without makeup or lipstick or hair extensions. Beautiful is being there for your friends when they need you most, chasing dreams that scare the hell out of you and taking chances even though you might fail.</p>
<p>Hot is trying to cover up your flaws, while beautiful is loving yourself unconditionally, no matter how flawed you may be. In fact, your flaws probably contribute to your beauty.</p>
<p>Hot is adding more; beauty is peeling back the layers.</p>
<p>Hot is on the outside; beauty stems from within.</p>
<p>Anyone can purchase hot; beauty is priceless.</p>
<p>Hot is however you define it; beauty is what you already are.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with having moments in your life when you want to be hot. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to feel confident in your own skin, or working hard to achieve a physical goal or feeling sexy while wearing red lipstick.</p>
<p>However, promise yourself that you won’t focus so much on being hot that you fail to see how beautiful you already are.&nbsp;The secret to figuring out whether you are hot or beautiful is realizing that you are already both.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/body-acceptance-movement-isnt-seems/860497/,Beauty,Why The ‘Body Acceptance Movement’ Isn’t Exactly What It Seems,"<p>In early September, Vogue Magazine <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/vogue-big-booty-era/750887/"" target=""_blank"">controversially declared</a> that we have officially entered the “Era of the Big Booty.”</p>
<p>While the magazine faced major backlash for the irresponsible statement, it was, to an extent, true: For the first time in what seems like ever, the media’s portrayal of the “ideal” female body is not the thin, heroin-chic look that dominated the 90s.&nbsp;Instead, it’s a curvier, more voluptuous figure.</p>
<p>It’s hard to pinpoint a single catalyst that ushered in this new body ideal.</p>
<p>Perhaps, it was born out of our cultural fixation on the famously bodacious Kardashians. Maybe it was inspired by Megan Trainor’s ever-popular <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/meghan-trainors-all-about-that-bass-is-this-summers-body-image-anthem-video/628538/"" target=""_blank"">body acceptance anthem</a> “All About That Bass.”</p>
<p>No matter the cause, however, it’s clear that when it comes to curves, the more, the merrier.</p>
<p>While the newfound appreciation for the curvier body is great — no longer are women held to impossible standards of thinness — it is, at the same time, also flawed.</p>
<p>See, it’s not so much a body acceptance movement as it is a glorification of curvy bodies. And in glorifying the shapely, we’re effectively ostracizing those who lack so-called “womanly” curves.</p>
<p>This realization was introduced to me by Natty Valencia, a singer-songwriter who <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/all-about-that-bass-cover/819444/"" target=""_blank"">performed a lyrically altered cover</a> of “All About That Bass” on her Youtube channel.</p>
<p>In the video’s introduction, Valencia&nbsp;explains that while the song is awesome, it also shames thin women (in one line, Trainor refers to thin women as “skinny bitches,” and in another, insinuates that ladies who don’t have curves can’t please a man without something to “hold onto at night.”)</p>
<p>The backlash against Victoria’s Secret (admittedly poorly-labeled) <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/body-every-body-except-majoritys/844363/"" target=""_blank"">Perfect “Body” campaign</a>, which featured thin women modeling one of the&nbsp;brand’s lines of underwear, reveals another instance of skinny-shaming.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after the advertisements’ release, the company was publicly apprehended for the “perfect” label coupled with&nbsp;thin women.</p>
<p>Many complained that the advertisements suggested that the thin body is the perfect body, insinuating that those with curvier figures were imperfect.</p>
<p>While the campaign could have been better&nbsp;thought-out, many argued that the women in the advertisements didn’t reflect what “real women” look like.</p>
<p>And therein lies the problem: To suggest that thin women aren’t <em>real</em> women is to discriminate based on body type — which is exactly what we’re trying to get away from.</p>
<p>Instead of embracing all body types, we’ve essentially replaced one ideal with another, outcasting all those who don’t fit into society’s newly-defined&nbsp;body norm.</p>
<p>Instead of idealizing a specific body type, we should be accepting all bodies because <em>all</em> bodies are beautiful.</p>
<p>By allowing ourselves even to suggest an ideal body, we’re simply perpetuating the notion that a woman’s worth lies in her&nbsp;appearance. That what a woman looks like is more important than, say, her intelligence, or her skills.</p>
<p>It’s not time to change the discussion, it’s time to <em>end</em> it. To discuss the female figure is to allow the continuation of appearance-based judgement; we cannot idolize one shape, one size, without denying the beauty of all others.</p>
<p>Who we are is more important than our dress size. It doesn’t matter what fruit or letter our bodies resemble — what matters is that we have bodies, beautiful bodies. We need to drop the negative speech and instead celebrate ourselves for who we are and what we can do.</p>
<p>Until that happens, this vicious cycle of judgement cannot end.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151354/Stocksy_txpc420a643hnW000_Small_503450-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/tips-tricks-and-natural-hair-care-remedies-photos/1010380/,Beauty,"5 Easy, Wallet-Friendly Tips To Restore Your Hair’s Health For Summer","<p>No matter how we decide to style, wash, color or cut our hair, it endures a variety of damaging irritants on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Some of these impurities are packaged in the form of beauty products; some are incorporated into the manufactured foods we eat, and others are simply the result of the environment&nbsp;and sun exposure.</p>
<p>Although hair fibers are mostly composed of hard keratins known to strengthen follicle&nbsp;cells, these durable proteins can be broken down over long periods of time.</p>
<p>With so many preventative hair restoration serums and regimens advertised on TV and in magazines, trying to come up with the perfect routine can be pretty frustrating — not to mention, expensive.</p>
<p>So, instead of pulling your hair out while determining the best strategy for protecting it, here are some simple, cost-efficient ideas for naturally and safely improving the quality of your hair:</p>
<h2>1. Study&nbsp;labels.</h2>
<p>Most of us think soapy bubbles are a good indication of a deep cleaning in process, but looks can be misleading.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the suds shampoos and conditioners create contain sulfates, which <a href=""http://www.babble.com/beauty/15-sulfate-free-shampoos/#aveeno-pure-renewal-shampoo"" target=""_blank"">severely dehydrate and irritate the scalp</a>.</p>
<p>Aside from avoiding sulfates, here are some positive ingredients and production styles&nbsp;you should look for while reviewing labels: non-GMO, sulfate-, surfactant- and paraben-free, vegan, eco-friendly, sustainable packaging and cruelty-free.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. Always&nbsp;use low heat.</h2>
<p>When drying your hair, always try to use a low heat. Although it’s timelier, high heat can burn strands, dry out hair follicles and cause unwanted frizz.</p>
<p>Try testing the heat intensity of you dryer beforehand by gently blowing the air on your hands or forearms.</p>
<p>If it burns, chances are the temperature is way too hot! After all, you’re trying to dry your hair, not fry it!</p>
<hr>
<h2>3.&nbsp;Stay hydrated.</h2>
<p>Drinking plenty of water is one of the easiest ways to replenish the fluids our bodies use throughout the day.</p>
<p>In addition to maintaining internal hydration, massaging your roots with a variety of consumable and essential oils is a quick treatment that can boost the scalp’s ability to retain moisture and prevent dandruff.</p>
<p>Some of these oils include&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/oils/coconut-oil-for-hair.html"" target=""_blank"">coconut oil</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.naturalhairrules.com/3-best-oils-for-natural-hair/"" target=""_blank"">avocado oil</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.chagrinvalleysoapandsalve.com/idascorner/ingredients/ingredients-faqs/essential-oil-faqs/essential-oils-used-in-hair-care"" target=""_blank"">rosemary oil</a>.</p>
<p>Most of these ingredients can be purchased at your local market or health food store, and they have fantastic shelf lives with no preservatives or expiration dates.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4.&nbsp;Consider a detox.</h2>
<p>Structured nutrient cleanses not only aid in body purification, but also have positive effects on natural hair restoration.</p>
<p>Homemade detoxification applications are ideal for replenishing our hair and eliminating residues or harsh chemicals.</p>
<p>Try out&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.md-health.com/Lemon-For-Hair.html"" target=""_blank"">lemon water</a>&nbsp;(with equal parts lemon juice and water) or tomato juice (with equal parts tomato liquid and water).</p>
<p>The naturally occurring acids in both of these liquids safely break down accumulated buildup from alternative hair products.</p>
<p>A quick rinse once a week (or every other week) should do the trick.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5.&nbsp;Be aware of&nbsp;nutrition.</h2>
<p>Most of us are familiar with the saying, “You are what you eat,” so it should come as no surprise we can fortify the strength of our hair follicles with food. Here are some of the best options:</p>
<p>1. Walnuts are rich in biotin and vitamin E, which help protect our cells from sun damage. Walnuts also contain copper, a mineral utilized for hair color maintenance.</p>
<p>2. Salmon contains a significant amount of omega-3 fatty acids, which the body requires to grow hair and sustain hydration.</p>
<p>3. Sweet potatoes are high in beta-carotene, which the body turns into vitamin A. Vitamin A helps the body produce natural oils to sustain moisture in the scalp and to prevent itching and dandruff.</p>
<p>4. Berries are loaded with antioxidants, which promote a variety of restorative properties.</p>
<p>5. Specifically, blueberries contain the most vitamin C, which supports the circulation within blood vessels that directly feed&nbsp;hair follicles.</p>
<p>6. Aronia berries are completely packed with polyphenols, which increase circulation and help reduce irritation.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href=""http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/amazing-health-benefits-of-almonds/"" target=""_blank"">almonds</a> are well known for containing large amounts of magnesium, a mineral vital for hair strength and sustained growth.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/helen-mirren-loreal-paris-photos/817718/,Beauty,Helen Mirren’s New L’Oréal Campaign Proves Beauty Has No Age Limit,"<p>Beauty has always been a&nbsp;woman’s most universal&nbsp;struggle: We are, and always have been, seasoned to strive toward impossible standards, be it a tiny waist in the age of the corset, or flawless, poreless skin in the age of the Instagram filter.</p>
<p>Despite claims that, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder” and “It’s what’s on the inside that counts,” it seems that we’re all pressured to seek one thing: physical perfection.</p>
<p>Of course, we all know that <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/dating/perfect-will-never-get-man/670131/"" target=""_blank"">perfection is a mirage</a> at best. Nobody is without flaws, and time only further reminds us that traditional, youthful beauty is fleeting — no quantity of “magic” creams or serums can change that.</p>
<p>What <em>can</em> change? Our perceptions. And one cosmetics company has set out to do just that.</p>
<p>L’Oréal Paris recently appointed 69-year-old actress Dame Helen Mirren as the UK brand ambassador in an effort to prove that beauty has no age — and no limits.</p>
<p>Though this isn’t the first time L’Oréal&nbsp;has hired an older actress to represent the&nbsp;company, it <em>is</em> the first time the campaign is going <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/11190510/Dame-Helen-Mirren-dont-retouch-my-image-LOreal.html"" target=""_blank"">sans Photoshop</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the company faced major backlash after a similar campaign featuring 68-year-old Diane Keaton appeared to be <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/13/loreal-diane-keaton-commercial_n_4591313.html"" target=""_blank"">heavily retouched</a>, essentially undermining their “ageless” beauty message.</p>
<p>As an older brand ambassador, Mirren says,</p>
<blockquote><p>I hope I can inspire other women towards greater confidence by making the most of their natural good looks.</p></blockquote>
<p>And though Mirren claims she is only “ok-looking,” she looks stunning in the debut images from the campaign, modeling a fresh, feminine look.</p>
<p>As <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/pictures/lmj45jdlf/no-3-loreal/"" target=""_blank"">the third largest cosmetics company</a> in the world, L’Oréal&nbsp;holds a lot of swaying power, and other companies are beginning to <a href=""http://www.graziadaily.co.uk/beauty/makeup/age-aint-nothin-but-a-number-beauty-brands-opt-for-mature-campaign-fronters"" target=""_blank"">follow its&nbsp;lead</a> in hiring unconventional beauties to head their campaigns.</p>
<p>This year, luxury cosmetics company NARS hired 68-year-old British actress and model Charlotte Rampling as a brand ambassador, while 64-year-old actress Jessica Lange was cast as the face of Marc Jacobs beauty prior to that.</p>
<p>So, what does this all mean? In short,&nbsp;we’re getting somewhere.</p>
<p>There’s still work to be done: The fashion and beauty industries remain overwhelmingly white, young and thin, and scandals like Walmart’s public <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/news/world/walmart-fat-girls-halloween-costumes-photo/815503/"" target=""_blank"">fat-shaming</a> are, unfortunately, still common — but it’s a step in the right direction. And for that, let’s be grateful.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are the&nbsp;first images from Mirren’s new campaign with L’Oréal.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/what-women-are-really-thinking-at-the-nail-salon/,Beauty,What Girls Are Really Thinking At The Nail Salon,"<p>Getting a manicure is our time to ourselves when we can read some salacious celebrity gossip and do absolutely nothing for a half an hour.</p>
<p>Yet what should be a relaxing time is actually overrun by our comical inner monologues. Here’s what women are really thinking at the nail salon…</p>
<h2>Did I choose the right color?</h2>
<p>That midnight purple looked a lot more midnight than purple when you tested it on your thumb beforehand. “It’s in the plum family though,” you rationalize to yourself as the nail technician moves from one hand to the next. You breathe a sigh of relief – it’s much darker with two coats. Okay, you can live with it…but, um how much is a polish change?</p>
<hr>
<h2>Are they talking about me?</h2>
<p>You’re sure that the manicurists are making fun of your wrecked cuticles, but it’s just been a really stressful week! Do they secretly mind your cellphone use or are they laughing about your telephone conversation? You resolve not to care and tip a little extra for having them endure your chatter about your weekend recap.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Don’t make eye contact during the hand massage</h2>
<p>This part of the manicure can get unexpectedly intimate…and fast. It feels really awesome, but is she lingering a little too long on your hand?</p>
<hr>
<h2>Picking your nail color based on the name of the polish</h2>
<p>How would you describe yourself? Are you an “Ole Caliente” or an “Armed and Ready”? You are such a sucker for marketing, you think to yourself as you settle on Essie’s “Smoking Hot.”</p>
<hr>
<h2>Is that sanitary?</h2>
<p>That blue light machine is questionably clean and looking a little suspect. Is it a hundred percent hygienic? Oh well, you’ll take your chances on this one.</p>
<hr>
<h2>I hope my feet don’t smell</h2>
<p>Pedicures are a serious luxury for a reason. Being a pedicurist is kind of being like a middle school chorus teacher – it’s an unpleasant job, but someone’s got to do it!</p>
<hr>
<h2>My nail beds suck</h2>
<p>This is a very real thing. We understand.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Wow, I feel so clean all of a sudden!</h2>
<p>Despite the tools’ unconfirmed sanitation status, your hands and feet feel like a whole new level of freshness. You admire how your fingers look dangling your keys or how perfect your feet are in your peep toe pumps. Is that a musical chorus in the background? We think it is!</p>
<hr>
<h2>I should have shaved my legs</h2>
<p>The pedicurist has seen worse, right? You can’t be the first person who’s forgotten to groom her hairs before a rubdown. Er, at least that’s what you’re telling yourself as the technician towels your legs dry.</p>
<hr>
<h2>She’s cutting too much off</h2>
<p>That was a good 6 weeks of hard work letting your nails grow that the manicurist just trimmed off. Now you’re going to have to start from square one again. Bummer.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Ouch! That’s my cuticle</h2>
<p>That green liquid those manicurists are applying to your cut is probably not the safest, but it gets the job done. What kind of magic potion is stopping the bleeding, you’ll probably never know. There’s no going back now though.</p>
<hr>
<h2>I feel so bad that she has to touch my toes right now</h2>
<p>Feet are gross.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Ohh…that tickles…I hope I don’t kick her in the face</h2>
<p>But seriously, stop tickling us. And we’re tired holding our legs up while our heels are scrubbed.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The girls sitting next to us sound like idiots</h2>
<p>Do we sound like that when we’re getting our nails done together? Why are they talking so loudly about their boyfriends? Are they planning on inviting everyone to their party tonight because these sole sisters (see what we did there?) are certainly sharing all details?</p>
<hr>
<h2>Should I have gotten square? Or round?</h2>
<p>The ultimate debate. No matter what you choose, you won’t be satisfied.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04150851/Stocksy_txp2e21cfdakuW000_Small_6756211-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/perfection-is-boring-how-your-flaws-make-you-interesting/,Beauty,Perfection Is Boring: How Your Flaws Make You Interesting,"<p>My name is Laura Argintar and I was born with a slight underbite and a sliver of space in between my two front teeth. The underbite has since been fixed, but pushing my two front teeth together to permanently close the gap has been a lifelong battle.</p>
<p>I don’t know if never having braces is my biggest regret or blessing. I thankfully never experienced that specific middle school torture that comes with owning a metal mouth (although I did have my fair share of taunts, I am a writer after all). But I now have found myself in an almost 24-year relationship with my retainer.</p>
<p>Everything about me screams full adult — save for my nightly routine that is not unlike a prepubescent eighth grader’s. I retrieve my plastic case from its hiding spot (lest a potential suitor should find it, or heaven forbid, smell it) that still has water-stained shreds of my orthodontist’s “In case of missing” label.</p>
<p>I rinse it off, give it a quick brush and pop the plastered piece into my mouth. I next carefully make sure that the thin wires are wrapped around the two front teeth so that they’re gently pushed together in my sleep, like cuddling dentures I suppose.</p>
<p>And then every morning, without fail, I pop it back out, wipe the excess drool from my lower lip and smile into the mirror.</p>
<p>The gap is closed, temporarily sealed until the silent force of my mouth separates the doomed teeth and once again they must be put back into their place later before bed. And it will be this way for the rest of my life. Eternity, or at least until the teeth are replaced by false ones when I’m older.</p>
<p>There is no date for when I’m expected to no longer need it. There is no timeline for when the retainer gets removed, as would braces or other orthodontic measures. As long as I want to keep these bad boys together, I’ve no choice but to wear my retainer.</p>
<p>There is, however, the alternative. One that doesn’t involve any orthodontics or plastic surgery at all, but that somehow terrified me the most: leaving my teeth alone and letting my gap-tooth take over.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, I finally stopped wearing the retainer. It honestly just stopped making sense to keep fighting what came natural to me. And though it sounds trivial, it was rather exhausting having to remember the retainer every night.</p>
<p>So now I have a slim space between my two front-teeth that I affectionately refer to as my gap-tooth. I no longer mind it. </p>
<p>I no longer recognize it when first glancing at my reflection. I actually think it looks quite cute. And I’m secretly smitten when a man slips his tongue inside my mouth and can feel the sensation on that small strip of gum.</p>
<p>I’ve come to prefer the way I look with my gapped teeth than when they’re perfectly straight. It’s more authentic and that, to me, is beautiful.</p>
<p>But gap-tooth or not, it doesn’t really matter. Because I am still Laura Argintar.</p>
<hr>
<h2>1. Birthmarks</h2>
<p>Moles on your lip. Freckles on your butt. These are like your own personalized tattoos, no needles required. Birthmarks are super special parts of your body because only you know them best. Wherever you have them, consider yourself lucky because no one else’s is quite like yours.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. Bumped noses</h2>
<p>Whoever said bumped noses needed to be straightened clearly did not meet Penelope Cruz or Owen Wilson, two very good-looking celebrities with less-than-perfect noses.</p>
<p>If an irregularly shaped nose fits your face and makes you feel beautiful, there’s no need to conform to generic idealizations of beauty. Don’t go changing a good thing.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Crooked smiles</h2>
<p>Don’t go through life frowning about your mouth, especially when it was made to smile. People don’t remember what another person’s grin looks like, but they will remember yours.</p>
<p>Use your imperfect smile to share joy and laughter and you’ll make an even more lasting impression.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Hammer thumbs</h2>
<p>We wouldn’t even characterize hammer thumbs as flaws, except we know how sensitive people are about their phalanges.</p>
<p>Hammer thumbs are awesome! You get a major advantage when it comes to playing video games and gripping things. And your version of “thumbs up” is much more fun to look at.</p>
<p>Hammer thumbs are the level above opposable ones.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. Dimpled chins</h2>
<p>Dimpled chins are the holy grail of facial imperfections — they’re sexy, interesting and rare. How many people can say that their chins double as slot machines? Cha-ching!</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. Missing limbs</h2>
<p>Lacking a certain appendage doesn’t make you any less of a beautiful human being. What you have is spectacular and what you’ve gained from what you’ve lost is so much more important.</p>
<hr>
<h2>7. Scars</h2>
<p>Over the course of your life, you’re going to accumulate many scars. They tell the stories that you would otherwise forget and fail to learn from. The time you fell off your bike and now you’ll always wear a helmet.</p>
<p>The time you burned your hand helping grandma bake cakes for Passover, which has now become an annual tradition. These are the signs that you’ve lived a life full of adventure and risk and fulfillment.</p>
<hr>
<h2>8. Untameable hair</h2>
<p>Why are we so obsessed with making sure everything is in its proper place? Messy is real and perfectly polished has been done before.</p>
<p>Whatever texture your hair and no matter how far out it spans — it’s your unique style and only you can wear it best. Don’t be afraid of your natural beauty.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/lets-end-the-bikini-bridge-madness-right-here/,Beauty,Why We Need To End The Bikini Bridge Madness Right Now,"<p>The Bikini Bridge: What started as a “<a href=""http://www.today.com/health/dont-fall-bikini-bridge-prank-internet-playing-you-2D11872362"">hoax</a>” (can someone explain to me how posting photos of emaciated bodies and asking everyone to talk about it is considered a hoax?) from the anonymous users of 4chan, has now become a viral, Internet phenomenon.</p>
<p>Not because the term’s creators were particularly clever (<a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/bikini-bridge-started-internet-prank-real-damage-article-1.1569783"">according to Urban Dictionary</a>,&nbsp;this term has been around since 2009), but because a woman’s body has become the focal point in today’s society. And, following the popularity of the “thigh gap” and “skinny arm,” it was only a matter of time until scrutinizing a new appendage became all the rage.</p>
<p>When I first heard about the “bikini bridge,” I rolled my eyes and laughed (which perhaps was what 4chan was hoping for when they dubbed their propaganda a “hoax”).</p>
<p>And then I continued about my merry day, writing some articles and googling pictures of celebrity mug shots. And that was it. Zero f*cks given about yet another ridiculous body standard. Because, as an only partially-insecure woman, I care more about my nail beds totally sucking (hats off to Gretchen Weiners for that one).</p>
<p>The kind of physique referenced here would never be in my realm and it’s not because I don’t care to starve myself. If I hated myself that much and really wanted to perpetuate this ridiculous trend, I suppose I could lie down on my back, angle my body just so, and super-suck-it-in while quickly snapping the photo.</p>
<p>Frankly, unless you were born with naturally protruding hip bones and/or missing ovaries, there’s no way that sunken image of the bikini bridge is even remotely attractive.</p>
<p>The point is that the whole notion of the bikini bridge is absolutely moronic. Just like how the original mention was (supposed to be) a hoax — the bikini bridge itself is not real.</p>
<p>You mean to say that somewhere between where I’m supposed to carry babies and where I digest my nutrients, I’m also supposed to have a concavity that is indicative of my fitness?! I hope everyone realizes how ludicrous it is that an absence of an abdomen is supposed to mean that we’re toned.</p>
<p>Some women have space between their thighs. Some women have space between their stomachs and bikinis. But the space that matters is the one in your heart.</p>
<p>From someone who makes her living writing for the Internet, don’t listen to everything you read on the Internet! (With the exception of any compelling literature from yours truly). If the whole idea of the bikini bridge was meant to be funny, then let’s all just laugh it off and move on.</p>
<p>And most importantly, Elite Daily apologizes for offending readers in our coverage of this news yesterday. There was a space inside our skulls.</p>

<p>In Japan, however, where women are encouraged to maintain their “ochobo” or “small and modest” mouth, it is considered bad manners for them to stuff face.</p>
<p>So what’s a gal to do when all she wants is to sink her teeth into one juicy mouthful? Enter the “<strong>Liberation Wrapper</strong>,” a specially designed burger wrapper that mimics a closed woman’s mouth while simultaneously masking her open chops. It’s printed with the lower half of a woman’s face, which allows her to publicly chow down on a burger without committing a social faux-pas.</p>
<p>The Liberation Wrapper has been so effective that sales of the Classic Burger from the FRESHNESS BURGER chain have increased by more than 200%. Now, that’s what we call a mouthful!</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/photoshop-retouching-too-skinny-women-healthier/,Beauty,"As If Photoshop Couldn’t Get Any Worse, Now They’re Retouching Too-Skinny Models To Look Healthier","<p><a href=""http://en.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/1u3rqz/models_are_so_thin_magazines_have_to_photoshop/"" target=""_blank"">According to Leah Hardy</a>, a former editor at Cosmopolitan magazine, the obsession with thinness has gone so far in that direction that models are often too skinny for the shoots they show up to, and photo editors must try to make them look fuller and healthier.</p>
<p>What happened to us? Photoshop used to be our friend. We used it to cover up our booze-filled <a href=""http://www.boozecats.com/"" target=""_blank"">Facebook pics with cats</a>, and to superimpose pictures of Avicii over our boyfriends’ faces (Oh weird, was that just me?). It was the rich man’s Instagram, the professional filter that allowed us to reclaim just a little control over how our memories are recorded.</p>
<p>But somewhere between <a href=""http://fashionista.com/2013/07/is-claire-danes-missing-a-leg-in-vogue/"">Claire Danes’ questionably missing leg </a>and an <a href=""http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/11/what-has-lucky-done-to-kerry-washington.html"">unrecognizable Kerry Washington</a>, it became Photoshop itself that needed the editing. Society stood all aghast as magazines came forward about removing wrinkles, adding tanner tones and, of course, slimming down their already-fit cover girls. But today, in light of recent admission that Photoshop must now be used to achieve the opposite effect — to bulk up the sickly-skinny who show up for shoots — we’re still left standing with the same dumb, bewildered look on our faces.</p>
<p>Where did it all go wrong? Is this our fault? We have proven unable to stay within a happy medium, and instead pervert Photoshop to both ends of the extremes.</p>
<p>On one hand, Photoshop has been used to distort women’s bodies from beautifully flawed imperfections to uniform testaments of our obsession with Stepford-esque stick figures.</p>
<p>Case in point — Jennifer Lawrence, a perfectly perfect human being who has been an outspoken advocate <i>against </i>body shaming, <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/entertainment/celebrity/wont-believe-jennifer-lawrence-looks-like-photoshopped/"" target=""_blank"">became a victim of the Photoshop</a> phenomenon when Flare Magazine decided in the editorial stages that her cheekbones had to appear more sunken in and her figure even more hourglass-y. The touch-ups might have been minimal but the message reads loud and clear: Women will continue to be scrutinized for their weight, their shape and their skin. You might be happy with yourself, but society sure isn’t.</p>
<p>Photoshop has proven to be a tool by which the haters can create a false reality for themselves, and for the masses who have sadly grown accustomed to glorifying a nonexistent ideal.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s comforting or harrowing to discover that models now — the very genetically gifted whom we females are taught to emulate — have themselves fallen prey to the Photoshop trap. Maybe in seeing the augmented mags, they forgot that the “them” staring up from the pages wasn’t the real “them” to begin with, but rather a concocted (Skinnier! Clearer-skinned!) version based on their original beauty (but after watching <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2480191/Who-IS-girl-Time-lapse-video-shows-radical-effect-Photoshop-models-body.html"" target=""_blank"">this Photoshop time lapse clip</a>, I’m not sure that we need models since robots or inanimate objects would seemingly do the trick).</p>
<p>These models are competing against this manufactured and unreal ideal, losing weight like they have to be literally less-than their Photoshopped selves.</p>
<p>While it’s probably a benefit to impressionable and insecure teenage girls everywhere that magazine editors decided not to glorify these emaciated forms and instead added pounds and curves to their cover photos, it’s disconcerting that even models — people professionally invested in the business of being beautiful — are unable to size up accurately, so to speak, to the expectations of the industry.</p>
<p>If supermodels can’t figure Photoshop out, how can we expect budding women to wade through all this body image bullsh*t?</p>
<p>We do know that when those images surface, we feel a true need to consume and comment. Minutes after Kim Kardashian <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/entertainment/celebrity/haters-gonna-hate-internet-loses-kim-kardashian-apparently-photoshops-instagram-photo/"" target=""_blank"">posted a butt selfie</a> on Instagram (always a good move, I say), followers and media outlets alike were sent into a frenzy, accusing the new mama of “new manipulation” for alleging Photoshopping the post work-out pic.</p>
<p>Image manipulation is a real cause for concern, <a href=""http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/a11-new-policies.page"" target=""_blank"">according to the American Medical Association</a>. AMA Board Member Dr. Barbara McAneny has said that “the appearance of advertisements with extremely altered models can create unrealistic expectations of appropriate body image. In one image, a model’s waist was slimmed so severely, her head appeared to be wider than her waist. We must stop exposing impressionable children and teenagers to advertisements portraying models with body types only attainable with the help of photo editing software.”</p>
<p>Although scientific data directly linking these Photoshopped, false advertisements with the development of eating disorders and other emotional issues are lacking, it doesn’t seem too far-fetched to state that such an unhealthy obsession with looking unhealthy has a negative impact on women today.</p>
<p>The AMA suggested (in 2011, mind you) that editors and advertisers work together with health organizations to create guidelines that prevent Photoshop from being used to propagate unrealistic and only drastically-attainable beauty standards. Needless to say, I don’t think that Vogue gave WHO a call.</p>
<p>But regardless of the preferred solution to our Photoshop pandemic, it’s clear that something has to change. If both the average woman and the seemingly super-human supermodel are failing to meet the Photoshop ideal, then this little tech tool is no longer working in our favor.</p>

<p>The site just posted four untouched photos of Lady Gaga posing for Versace’s Spring 2014 campaign, and has dissected every point where the original photos differ from the final, publicized product.</p>
<p>At this point, I don’t think anyone is surprised — Photoshopping is clearly something that magazines and fashion houses just do, and if you thought Gaga’s milky sheen in the ad photos was natural, then joke’s on you.</p>
<p>While Versace understandably erased some of Lady Gaga’s bruises, fixed the weird wig she’s wearing and amped up the photos’ contrast to give the whole setting a more dramatic look, they also slimmed down her arms, which makes little sense to me.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga seems to be another star (not unlike Lena Dunham) who has been outspoken about <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/entertainment/celebrity/lady-gaga-shows-figure-personal-blog/"" target=""_blank"">being a role model for a positive body image</a>, but then had her own form critiqued and changed through a partnership with a fashion brand.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/powerful-breast-cancer-photos-spark-controversy/,Beauty,Brave Woman Shows That Beauty Still Exists After Breast Cancer Through Powerful Photos (Graphic),"<p>Few brave women come forward to speak about their breast cancer battles, but even fewer are courageously willing to share intimate photos of themselves post-surgery.</p>
<p>Beth Whaanga from Queensland, Australia, a self-proclaimed “breast cancer preventer,” teamed up with photographer Nadia Masot after having multiple surgeries to rid her body of cancer in a photo series called “Under the Red Dress”.</p>
<p>The moving pictures depict Beth fully naked with labels directing the viewer to which scars correspond to the specific surgery. She posted the images to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/beth.whaanga/media_set?set=a.10152264624616514&amp;type=1"">Facebook</a> with the disclaimer:</p>
<blockquote><p>“WARNING: these images are confronting and contain topless material. They are not in anyway meant to be sexual. The aim of this project is to raise awareness for breast cancer.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Beth and Nadia’s message was that we have no idea what people are carrying around with them underneath all their layering and clothes. We have scars, we have flaws, we have insecurities — but every body is beautiful and tells its own story.</p>
<p>Regarding the photo shoot, she said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“At first it was confronting but after a little while rather empowering. A good experience, my scars are not ugly they mean I’m alive.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite Beth’s good intentions, however, the photo shoot went viral after people complained it was “inappropriate content.” Both Beth and her sister, Emma, wrote powerful responses, chief among them being that these Internet trolls “missed the point and I feel sad for you.”</p>
<p>Beth’s photos were meant to encourage breast awareness, as evidenced by her profound images and accompanying commentary. The fact that she needed to even explain herself and her photo series makes us question humanity.</p>
<p>But, like any true fighter, she and Nadia are hoping to continue their photo series with even more volunteers to show that “cancer effects everyone.”</p>

<p>It’s a six-week online course that teaches women how to maximize their climax, or what we like to call “climaximizing” (see what we did there?).</p>
<p>Tantra practitioner and vagina whisperer Layla Martin developed this class in hopes of helping women experience their full orgasmic pleasures, because why should boys be the only ones who get all the glory?</p>
<p>Over the six weeks, women learn how to use their body chemistry, pelvic floor, mind and breathing to enhance their Big O’s. Promised results include turning into a sexual unicorn and orgasm goddess, all for a hefty fee of $180.</p>
<p>But is an advertised lifetime of sexual bliss worth the price tag?</p>
<p>Sex editor <a href=""http://www.yourtango.com/2014203327/sex-can-class-teach-you-how-orgasm"" target=""_blank"">Rachel Khona from YourTango</a> enthusiastically volunteered herself to try it out. In her editorial, Khona describes participating in different sessions like “Pussy Breathing” (“breathing” from your vagina), the “Sexy Squeeze” (Kegels), “Inner Smiling” (smiling to yourself) and “Emotional Theater” (releasing negative emotions), among many others.</p>
<p>And according to Rachel, the classes didn’t disappoint.</p>
<blockquote><p>“My <a href=""http://www.yourtango.com/experts/susun-weed/six-amazing-things-you-didn-t-know-about-your-clitoris"">clitoris</a> was happier than she had been in a long time,” Khona says.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s nice to see a woman and her vagina receive a happy ending.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/5-beauty-benefits-of-vodka/989143/,Beauty,4 Ways Drinking Vodka Might Actually Benefit Your Appearance,"<p>We know vodka isn’t exactly great for our livers, waistlines, dance skills or public behaviors, but what you might not know is vodka offers&nbsp;many beneficial beauty uses.</p>
<p>It turns out vodka doesn’t just make you<em> think</em> you look great; it can help you look great, too.</p>
<p>While consumption still remains my preferred method of use, it’s good to know the translucent liquid isn’t just a one-trick pony. After reading this, vodka may just become your new beauty secret:</p>
<h2>1.&nbsp;Fresh Breath From That Hangover</h2>
<p>It may be a little hard to believe, but vodka can combat stinky morning breath.</p>
<p>Strange, considering after a big night out, you hardly wake up with good breath. But, apparently, it works just like store-bought mouthwash you sip, swish and spit.</p>
<p>Be careful not to swallow, though.</p>
<p>If you’re worried you might “accidentally” ingest some of it, or you’ll get boozy breath (not the best way to start the morning when you’re heading into the office), there is another option.</p>
<p>For a diluted version, you can add five tablespoons of cinnamon powder to one cup of straight vodka, stir and then store in an airtight container for one to two weeks.</p>
<p>After that, just strain the liquid. When it’s ready to use, add a capful of the liquid to some warm water and gargle.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2.&nbsp;Skin Toner After A Night Of Drinking</h2>
<p>Vodka can be great for your face in a number of ways: It helps tighten pores, gets rid of facial grime and leaves your face feeling clean.</p>
<p>New York-based dermatologist Jeannette Graf suggests dunking a cotton ball in a pre-made potion of green tea and vodka and applying it to your face every morning and night, just as you would any other facial product.</p>
<p>Simply boil a jug of green tea, let it cool and add 1.5 teaspoons of vodka.&nbsp;The green tea soothes your skin while the vodka helps to tighten it.</p>
<p>You can also opt to simply dab a cotton ball in the vodka and apply straight to your face.</p>
<p>Mixing watermelon juice, water and vodka also works great as a cocktail — err,&nbsp;skin toner.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Eliminate Wrinkles While You Stay Up All Night</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, you can’t stop wrinkles or get rid of them completely, but you <em>can</em> minimize their appearance.</p>
<p>You don’t have to blow your budget on pricey salon creams that claim to work; vodka can help!</p>
<p>Mix together a tablespoon of vodka, honey and fennel.&nbsp;Rub the paste all over your face and leave it on for approximately 20 minutes before washing it off.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Hair Spray That Stays The Whole Party</h2>
<p>There’s nothing worse while getting ready to go out on a Friday night than having your can of hairspray hiss in defeat: empty.</p>
<p>Never fear, vodka is here! And, let’s be honest: You are more likely to have a bottle of vodka laying around than a spare bottle of hairspray.</p>
<p>Siobhan O’Connor and Alexandra Spunt, authors of “<a href=""http://www.xovain.com/how-to/beauty-uses-for-vodka"" target=""_blank"">No More Dirty Looks</a>,”&nbsp;have a recipe that’s simple and easy to whip up.</p>
<p>All you need is water, vodka and two lemons or limes.</p>
<p>Combine the water and roughly-sliced citrus in a saucepan and cover with a lid. Turn to a low heat and let the mixture simmer for about 20 to 30 minutes. Once it’s cooled, remove the slices and transfer the water into a spray bottle.</p>
<p>Add a tablespoon of vodka to the bottle, then shake and spray. Voilà! You’ve got yourself a bottle of homemade hairspray.</p>
<p>So, go get your glow on (in more ways than one).</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151408/Stocksy_txpd7941517ouW000_Small_6296011-800x396.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/spring-nail-color-wear-based-horoscope/,Beauty,The Spring Nail Color You Should Wear Based On Your Horoscope,"<p>We’re combining our two favorite obsessions, nail polish and astrology, to determine what spring 2014 varnish best suits your horoscope.</p>
<p>When it comes to choosing nail lacquer, we’re all about making it personal. Feeling on edge, whimsical or super chic? Take a page from Beethoven, and express it with your fingertips.</p>
<p>Here is the spring nail color you should be wearing based on the stars. It’s fate.</p>
<h2>Aries (March 21 – April 19): Bold Fuchsia</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via <a href=""http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcltjbNqeH1qki2k3o1_500.jpg"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">Tumblr</span></a></em></span></p>
<p>You’re adventurous and headstrong at times, which is reflected in your audacious nail color. The Aries girl is always willing to take risks and is usually the first among her friends to totally go for it — your nails should be no different.</p>
<p>Have you met your match in a bright and brazen fuchsia?</p>
<hr>
<h2>Taurus (April 20 – May 20): Earthy Oranges</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via <a href=""thezoereport.com"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">Zoe Report</span></a></em></span></p>
<p>This retro palette looks good on every skin tone, just like your complementary personality. You’re fiercely loyal and you crave stability — this muted, yet cool varnish isn’t going anywhere. You’re also known to be somewhat stubborn, but take our advice, these spicy, folksy colors look super gorgeous especially paired with a crisp white piece for spring.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Gemini (May 21 – June 20): Half Moons</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via <span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""https://31.media.tumblr.com/803f5ac41f9c55d8f05238f5ab2bdb08/tumblr_n2g1jgL5ee1si7td4o1_500.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Tumblr</a></span></em></span></p>
<p>Geminis’ exciting personalities always come with a twist and the half-moon update on the french manicure is no different. You’re bright and quick-witted, so have fun with this modern manicure trend. Choosing two lacquers shouldn’t be a problem considering your fickle and conflicting nature.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Cancer (June 21 – July 22): Pastels</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small;""><em>via <a href=""http://media4.onsugar.com/files/2013/09/10/041/n/1922153/550a89ad247ec798_Barcelona_bks_M_RS14_9075.xxxlarge/i/Custo-Barcelona-Spring-2014.jpg"" target=""_blank"">On Sugar</a></em></span></p>
<p>Sensitive and emotional cancers will love the sweet and soft pastel nail trend for this spring. You love caring for others but tend to hold things in — much like the delicate, yet striking Easter egg tones. Cancers have a natural sense of peace about them, as do these nail varnishes.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Leo (July 23 – August 22): Fierce Nail Art</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via <a href=""styleblazer.com"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">Style Blazer</span></a></em></span></p>
<p>Leos love to be the center of attention and these ornately decorated nails are sure to turn heads. You’re always proud of your accomplishments, including your carefully executed nail embellishments. Your roar will be in full force this spring if you can remember to share the spotlight with your ornamental fingertips.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Virgo (August 23 – Sept. 22): New Nude</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via <a href=""https://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcdwb9J1Sv1rf01xpo1_400.jpg"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">Tumblr</span></a></em></span></p>
<p>The modest Virgo will welcome this spring’s new take on nude polish. Ranging from chai to blush, the practical hue will be more than appealing to the sensible and discerning Virgo girl. You are precise and like to keep to yourself, especially when it comes to your nail polish color.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Libra (September 23 – October 22): Blue Hues</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via <a href=""http://couturecourier.tumblr.com/page/100"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">Tumblr</span></a></em></span></p>
<p>Balanced, level-headed and graceful, Libras will put others at ease with their smooth blue nails. As the most sociable of the signs, you can entertain pretty much every shade there is, from royal to pale to sea blues. Your nails will be as charming as your refined and classy demeanor.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Scorpio (October 22 – November 21): Shady Lady</h2>
<p><em><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;"">via <span><a href=""http://media.tumblr.com/2864ffbdf8f5c663327592af2f9ae3f8/tumblr_inline_mieg3eyx4A1qz4rgp.png"" target=""_blank"">Tumblr</a></span></span></em></p>
<p>Murky greys and greens feel fitting for your emotionally powerful and, at times, cunning presence. Donning smokey nails appropriately reflects your sultry and resourceful disposition. Spring better watch out for the Scorpio who is determined to take nail color by storm.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/know-guac-extra-5-ways-use-avocados-beauty-product/986026/,Beauty,I Know Guac Is Extra: 5 Ways To Use Avocados As A Beauty Product,"<p>Ah, avocado: the glorious fruit that us, ladies, cannot get enough of. Say the word “avocado” and we are there. Avocado in salads, avocado on toast and, of course, the holy grail of all dips: guacamole.</p>
<p>I mean, guac is basically the sole reason to even step inside Chipotle, and we all know it.</p>
<p>Avocados are hardworking multi-taskers. In addition to being delicious, they also provide some serious benefits in the beauty department.</p>
<p>Because avocados are full of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, it’s not hard to find excuses to eat&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise, then, that avocados offer nutrients for our inner and outer health, as they are common&nbsp;ingredients in many beauty products.</p>
<p>But, you don’t need to make a&nbsp;Sephora run to take advantage of all the&nbsp;delicious fruits have to offer.&nbsp;In fact, look no further than your own kitchen.</p>
<p>Here are six ways to&nbsp;use raw avocados straight from your kitchen shelf to improve your beauty game:</p>
<h2>1. Make your own avocado hair mask.</h2>
<p>When it comes to hair, there are many old wives’ tales about what might make your locks&nbsp;soft and shiny. And, avocados are the king of hair softeners.</p>
<p>There are many recipes out there for DIY avocado masks. Some <a href=""http://www.allure.com/beauty-trends/blogs/daily-beauty-reporter/2014/09/diy-avocado-hair-mask.html"" target=""_blank"">contain other ingredients</a>,&nbsp;like olive oil and lemon, <a href=""http://backtoherroots.com/2014/04/28/whipped-avocado-honey-and-olive-oil-hair-mask/"" target=""_blank"">others suggest</a> blending in honey.</p>
<p>If you’re the kind of person who worries about how her hair smells, add&nbsp;<a href=""http://thebeautydepartment.com/2011/06/whip-it-real-good/"" target=""_blank"">a few drops of jasmine or lavender</a> for a lovely scent.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. Use avocado oil as sunscreen.</h2>
<p>If you’re worried about chemicals from drugstore sunscreens, think about creating your own natural sun protection using avocado oil.</p>
<p>Avocado oil by itself only provides <a href=""http://livingprettynaturally.com/natural-oil-sunscreens-what-you-need-to-know/"" target=""_blank"">up to 15 SPF</a>, but you can mix it with other oils to create a stronger ointment.</p>
<p>By mixing avocado oil with other ingredients, you can create a sunblock that contains a higher protection. <a href=""http://greatbodyskin.com/natural-sunblock-recipe/"" target=""_blank"">This recipe</a> calls for coconut, sesame, avocado and carrot seed oils, as well as shea butter and aloe vera gel.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Turn guacamole into body lotion.</h2>
<p>The vitamins in avocados are great&nbsp;for achieving softer skin, and the texture of avocados translates perfectly to a lotion.</p>
<p>You can simply mash an avocado until it reaches a creamy consistency, then spread it over your skin. Leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes before rinsing it off.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling crafty, try<a href=""http://mom.me/mind-body/1145-homemade-avocado-moisturizers-dry-skin/"" target=""_blank""> this recipe</a> for a more advanced concoction. You’ll need a cooked, mashed carrot, honey, one egg and heavy cream in addition to your avocado.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Smear&nbsp;that avocado right on your face.</h2>
<p>Ladies, who’s with me? Sometimes, there’s nothing more refreshing than a good, old face mask; nothing feels quite as good as peeling off that layer and then washing your newly-fresh skin.</p>
<p>Avocados are often the top ingredient in the face masks you find in beauty or drug stores, and for good reason. Vitamins A, E, B and K are all found in avocados and they can do wonders for the skin on your face.</p>
<p>There are dozens of options when it comes to a DIY avocado face mask. Try mixing that awesome green stuff with <a href=""http://mom.me/mind-body/1145-homemade-avocado-moisturizers-dry-skin/"" target=""_blank"">banana and egg yolk</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=""http://theeverygirl.com/at-home-avocado-honey-yogurt-face-mask"" target=""_blank"">honey and yogurt</a>. Use a brush or your fingers to apply it and let it sit on your skin for 10 to 15 minutes before rinsing.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. Put down the ChapStick and make your own lip scrub.</h2>
<p>In addition to being a sunscreen substitute, avocado oil also lends itself to working as a lip scrub.</p>
<p>If you <a href=""http://diybeautydiva.com/recipe-items/diy-avocado-lip-scrub/"" target=""_blank"">combine avocado oil with sugar</a>, you’ll find yourself holding a perfect product for softer and healthier lips.</p>
<p>A bonus idea: Purchase small tins and make mini lip scrubs for all your girlfriends. These could make great holiday or bridesmaid gift (so long as no one is tempted to eat them).</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151214/Stocksy_txp427cc5adccW000_Small_622308.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/celebrity-stylist-rule-behind-short-hair/1035701/,Beauty,Celebrity Stylist Reveals The ‘Rule’ Behind Having Long Or Short Hair,"<p>Deciding to cut your hair into a bob can feel like a decision on par with changing your career path or taking on a juice cleanse.</p>
<p>On one hand, it takes years for your hair to accumulate any real length. On the other, who wants to go through summer with a sweaty neck?</p>
<p>As it turns out, there might be an easy way out of your endless mental pro-con lists.</p>
<p>Giles Robinson, a senior stylist at&nbsp;John Frieda Salons UK, <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3079436/Do-pass-2-25-inch-rule-Celebrity-stylist-reveals-secret-formula-short-hair-suit-face-shape.html?ito=social-facebook"" target=""_blank"">recommends an easy measurement</a> as the deciding factor in chopping off your locks.</p>
<p>Daily Mail reports the technique, reportedly&nbsp;created by John Frieda, asks women to hold a pencil or straightedge horizontally under their chins.</p>
<p>Then, the ruler is placed directly under the earlobe, running perpendicular to the pencil.</p>
<p>If the pencil meets the ruler anywhere 2.25 inches or under, Robinson believes you’re best suited for short hair. For women who measure over 2.25 inches, however, long hair may be more flattering.</p>
<p>Or you could just cut your hair to whatever length you’d like. It’ll grow back.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151233/Stocksy_txp4172e78bJqW000_Small_677363-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/harvard-womens-rugby-team-send-powerful-message-photos/687465/,Beauty,Harvard Women’s Rugby Team Strips Down To Send A Very Powerful Message (Photos),"<p>Today’s uplifting body image news comes straight from Harvard University, where the women’s rugby team stripped down to teach us all a lesson in acceptance.</p>
<p>In a photo project called “<a href=""http://ruggedgrace.tumblr.com/"" target=""_blank"">Rugged Grace</a>,” the Harvard Women’s Rugby Team members wear nothing but grey sports bras and shorts.</p>
<p>Across random body parts are inspirational words and compliments scribbled in black marker — after taking off their clothes, teammates took to one another to remark what they appreciated about their fellow athletes.</p>
<p>And, unsurprisingly, the comments that came out of this activity aren’t superficial, like “nice abs” and “good butt,” but the more meaningful, such as “so strong,” “humble” and “big heart.”</p>
<p>Not only are the ensuing images a true mark of camaraderie, but they teach us that body appreciation and happiness doesn’t have to be obvious or even come from our physical being; sometimes, the way we make others feel is much more important, and reflects positively back onto us.</p>
<p>On the <a href=""http://ruggedgrace.tumblr.com/"" target=""_blank"">Rugged Grace Tumblr</a> site, the women write their impetus for starting this project:</p>
<blockquote><p>We decided to have players write their favorite things about other players physically on their bodies to demonstrate the immense body positivity, encouragement of strength and utility, and the overall supportive nature of this team.</p>
<p>Rugby is so much about physically throwing your body on the line for your teammates during games and training, and that intense appreciation, love, trust, and support for each other is what we wanted to reflect.</p>
<p>The sport necessitates a strength that we find beautiful and powerful.</p></blockquote>
<p>These images make such a positive impact on how women should be looking and evaluating their own bodies.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/creams-treatment-cure-sunburn/1101620/,Beauty,"5 Weird, Cheap And Effective Treatments You Can Use To Cure Sunburn","<p>Overexposure to sun rays is as unnecessary as men commenting on women’s sports.</p>
<p>According to <a href=""http://www.skincancer.org/prevention/sunburn/facts-about-sunburn-and-skin-cancer"">The Skin Cancer Foundation</a>, overly basking in the sun can cause long-lasting damage to the skin (think fine lines and wrinkles) and ups repeat offenders’ chances of skin cancer.</p>
<p>Recent studies <a href=""http://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(15)01352-3/abstract"">reveal</a>&nbsp;only 29 percent of women apply sunscreen regularly, leaving the forgetful few to roast like chickens at KFC.</p>
<p>Whether you bunker down in a concrete jungle or spend your off days beaching, be sure to soak up your vitamin D responsibly.</p>
<p>But if you’re already a burned-out trainwreck à la Amy Schumer, look no further than your kitchen or medicine cabinet for a sunburn cure.</p>
<p>Here are five <em>almost</em> all-natural reliefs for curing your skin after you’ve been cooked.</p>
<h2>1. Mad-Real Remedy: Advil</h2>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/science-behind-winter-skin-routine/926175/,Beauty,Show Mother Nature Who’s Boss By Winter-Proofing Your Skincare Regimen,"<p>Skincare woes top the list of reasons why I hate winter.</p>
<p>Blistering winds and sub-zero temps wreak havoc on my skin, and by this time of year, I’m ready to throw in the towel and hide out in my apartment until spring.</p>
<p>I know I’m not alone, though. Nearly everyone deals with some sort of winter-related beauty problem, be it chapped lips, dry skin, redness or dullness.&nbsp;While it seems these beauty concerns are unavoidable, they’re not — at least, not <em>entirely</em>.</p>
<p>Similar to how your wardrobe changes seasonally, your skincare routine should, too.</p>
<p>But, simply swapping out lightweight moisturizers for richer ones isn’t enough; your beauty cabinet should see a complete overhaul, with products designed specifically for protecting your skin from the elements.</p>
<p>If this all seems a bit confusing, it’s because it is.</p>
<p>Unless you’re a dermatologist, it’s tricky to determine&nbsp;which ingredients lock in moisture best, or soothe the redness caused by harsh winds.</p>
<p>That’s where we come in.</p>
<p>We’ve recruited top skin guru&nbsp;Dr. Harold Lancer (dermatologist to Kim Kardashian and Victoria Beckham) to teach us everything there is to know about winter skincare needs.</p>
<p>From which ingredients to seek out, to the best products to add to your beauty arsenal, our comprehensive guide will teach you everything you need to know about cold-weather beauty.</p>
<p>Follow our advice, and come spring, you’ll be looking as fresh as a damn daisy — even if they haven’t bloomed yet.</p>
<h2>1. Dry Skin</h2>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>The Sitch:&nbsp;</b>Dry, chapped skin tops the list of most common beauty concerns during the cooler months. That’s because once the temperature drops, so does the humidity. This, in turn, effectively strips the moisture from our skin (and blasting the heat only makes it worse).</p>
<p><strong>Doctor’s Orders:&nbsp;</strong>To combat dryness, Dr. Lancer suggests “adding in products that contain ceramides, which help to improve and maintain skin’s barrier function, as well as hyaluronic acid, [to] boost moisture levels.”</p>
<p>Ceramides are often used to treat eczema because they replenish the skin’s natural lipids and restore its natural barrier, preventing future damage.</p>
<p>Hyaluronic acid, on the other hand, is a humectant, meaning it draws moisture from the air to the skin. In fact, each molecule can retain over 1,000 times its weight in water, which, when applied topically, makes for some serious hydration.</p>
<p><strong>What This Means For You: </strong>Those<strong>&nbsp;</strong>itchy, dry splotches are in serious need of some TLC.</p>
<p><strong>The Fix:&nbsp;</strong>Look for products with a high concentration of the acid, like&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.lorealparisusa.com/en/products/skin-care/treatments/revitalift-daily-volumizing-concentrated-serum.aspx#ingredients"" target=""_blank"">L’Oreal Revitalift Daily Volumizing Concentrated Serum</a> ($25), for optimum moisturizing potential.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. Flakiness</h2>
<p><strong>The Sitch:</strong>&nbsp;It looks like it’s snowing on your face because your skin is so flaky.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor’s Orders:&nbsp;</strong>If you’re finding your skin is flaky, Dr. Lancer suggests “scal[ing] back on exfoliating acids (glycol, lactic, and fruit acids) or retinoids.” While these ingredients make wonderful exfoliants, they may be too harsh when combined with winter’s frigid, drying winds.</p>
<p>Instead, look for products with lightweight oils to create a hydrating barrier that&nbsp;keeps your skin from succumbing to the elements.</p>
<p><strong>What This Means For You:</strong>&nbsp;Unless you’re a snake, ditch the chemicals to shed all that&nbsp;scaly skin.</p>
<p><strong>The Fix:&nbsp;</strong>We love the <a href=""http://store.swbasicsofbk.com/products/oil-serum"" target=""_blank"">Oil Serum</a> ($29) from Brooklyn-based company <a href=""http://swbasicsofbk.com"" target=""_blank"">S.W. Basics</a>.&nbsp;It’s packed with vitamin-rich avocado, geranium, turmeric and coffee oils, all rich in soothing fatty acids.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s non-comedogenic — it won’t clog your pores — and organic. Any similar facial oil will have comparable benefits; but peek at the ingredient list to make sure there aren’t any harsh chemicals to&nbsp;counteract the oil’s soothing properties.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Dullness</h2>
<p><strong>The Sitch:</strong> It’s totally grey outside and so is your skin. You can’t even achieve that “glow” from cuffing season.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor’s Orders:&nbsp;</strong>The number one thing you can do to combat dullness is exfoliate. Dr. Lancer suggests minimizing the usage of chemical exfoliants, so look for a facial cleanser with microbeads, which are gentler than natural exfoliants like crushed seeds.</p>
<p>It’s best to exfoliate a few times a week. On the other days, wash with a creamy facial cleanser that’s preferably sulfate-free. Though sulfates produce a better lather, they can strip too much from the skin.</p>
<p><strong>What This Means For You: </strong>Slough away&nbsp;dead skin to reveal a healthy, youthful glow.</p>
<p><strong>The Fix:&nbsp;</strong>A good bet? <a href=""https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/corp/area/shop-online/category/face-masks/product/0568/wild-rose-beauty-balm-1-76-oz/&nbsp;"" target=""_blank"">Neal’s Yard Wild Rose Beauty Balm</a> ($70), which includes rejuvenating patchouli, antioxidant-rich rose hip seed oil, and starflower, known for its anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>It’s pricey, but&nbsp;so is Botox.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Redness</h2>
<p><strong>The Sitch:&nbsp;</strong>Rudolph isn’t the only red guy in town anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor’s Orders:&nbsp;</strong>Redness in the winter has two causes: irritation and sunburn. As Dr. Lancer explains, “Just because it’s winter does not mean you should forgo the use of sunscreen.&nbsp;Make sure [to use] an SPF of at least 30 every day.”</p>
<p><strong>What This Means For You:&nbsp;</strong>Follow Mom’s advice and always use protection.</p>
<p><strong>The Fix:&nbsp;</strong>Look for daily moisturizers with sunscreen, such as <a href=""http://www.fresh.com/US/black-tea/black-tea-age-delay-lotion-broad-spectrum-sunscreen-spf-20/H00002682.html"" target=""_blank"">Fresh Black Tea Age Delay SPF 20</a> ($65), which includes nourishing natural ingredients, like black tea and lychee seed extract, to fight free radicals and repair damage.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/shaving-social-norms/664625/,Beauty,Why Shaving My Head For Cancer Created Controversy For Me,"<p>For most of my life, except for that middle school awkward period, I have been fairly confident in my personality and appearance.</p>
<p>Nearly four months ago, I had my head shaved at my university’s St. Baldrick’s Day event to raise money for and support children’s cancer research.</p>
<p>Right off the bat I received mixed opinions, before even having my head shaved. I had a cousin suggest I participate in a different charity so I didn’t <i>have to</i> shave my head.</p>
<p>While I appreciated the suggestion, I was disgruntled by his lack of support; that was until I received an even more controversial reaction from my grandfather who said, “I will not support a bald grand<i>daughter.</i>”</p>
<p>No one, male or female, in my family had participated in St. Baldrick’s, so I had been unsure how they would all react.</p>
<p>As usual, I was proving myself to be the black sheep in the family and became upset that all they could see in the matter was my head shaving, not the charity I was supporting.</p>
<p>Five days after my decision, the day arrived and I sat in a chair in front of the campus fountains, baring my head to the world one section of hair at a time. I smiled, ready to face the world that would soon be less likely to accept me.</p>
<p>“I think you can actually pull this off” and “Oh wow, you have a nice shaped head” were two comments I received from the peanut gallery of friends who had come out to support me. I was grateful to have such a solid friend base that did support my decision and the cause.</p>
<p>My favorite comment came two days later from one of the third graders I had been student teaching. He walked up to me, placed his hand on my back and said, “I don’t mean to hurt your feelings, but you look like a boy.”</p>
<p>I should have seen this all coming from my family’s reactions, but that comment would set the stage for the following months.</p>
<p>The first few days, I was over the moon about my new do and the shocked looks on my classmates’ faces. Then, the novelty wore off and it blended into the normality of my everyday life. As I became more used to it, society began going in the other direction.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I was being stared at everywhere I went. For a quick moment, I liked the attention and then that, too, passed, leaving me with a feeling of insecurity and discomfort.</p>
<p>It made me feel less feminine, and I began to wear makeup on a daily basis when, before the shave, it had only been a weekend routine.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it didn’t take me long to see through the stares and blatant whispers within my earshot. From behind, my gender was questioned, from the front, my sexuality, sanity, health and dignity were questioned.</p>
<p>I felt horrible, but I had done something most women would never risk for whatever personal or societal reason. On top of that, I raised money for children’s cancer research and stuck to my guns.</p>
<p>Again, my old self crept back in, and I felt more beautiful and confident than ever. When I was hit on, the men actually tried to get to know me; they asked about my bald head and about my interests.</p>
<p>It was like I had been hiding behind my long brown hair, which honestly exposed a whole new realm of the dating world I had never realized.</p>
<p>It was shallow, thoroughly disturbing and has made me consider staying bald forever. A bald head really is a great conversation starter; even my current super short pixie is a talking point among my friends and newfound acquaintances.</p>
<p>Over these past four months, after my initial experiences with being bald, I have been on a journey to relinquish vanity as best I can. Like all people, I feel myself slip every now and again and need to add a splash of lipgloss, but then I remember those who do not get to choose this feeling of marginalization like I did.</p>
<p>I shaved my head for St. Baldrick’s, not only to raise money for cancer research, but to raise a middle finger to cancer and to stand with those who are suffering.</p>
<p>I do not know the suffering endured physically or even mentally because of the disease, but I do know that those affected shouldn’t have to put up with the way people stare and whisper on top of all that.</p>
<p>Without even realizing it, I placed myself in a difficult position and even risked losing friends. Yes, all over the simple act of shaving my head. The whole experience boiled down to societal norms and the need to relinquish them.</p>
<p>I would love to say that every woman should shave her head and experience this beautiful and soulful journey I have walked, but every experience is different.</p>
<p>What I can say is every woman and every person with or without makeup or disease is beautiful. Every person should make it a goal to step outside of him or herself and take little soul-searching journeys whenever possible.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/weed-beauty-product-skincare/958492/,Beauty,Going Green: Weed Is The Best Beauty Product You Never Knew About,"<p>Looking for your next high?&nbsp;What if we told you your next spliff might be best used for your&nbsp;<em>face</em>?</p>
<p>While&nbsp;you might’ve thought the benefits of marijuana were limited to a recreational high and an <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/news/world/colorado-made-millions-selling-tons-weed-2014/955237/"" target=""_blank"">economy booster</a>, it turns out the magical plant improves hair and skin. And the beauty industry is commoditizing big time.</p>
<p>In fact, according to data from <a href=""http://www.nutritionaloutlook.com/150313/Hemp"" target=""_blank"">Nutritional Outlook</a>, the US is the leading market for hemp-based beauty and food products:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Hemp Industries Association (HIA; Summerland, CA) estimates 21.2% retail sales growth in 2014 for hemp food and body care products, putting the 2014 total at $200 million.</p></blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;sticky icky isn’t just&nbsp;worth its weight in cash, but also in environmentally-friendly cosmetology.</p>
<p>Cannabis can help with a load of different skin ailments, from skin disease and acne to aging.</p>
<p>Though this might be the first you’re hearing about it,&nbsp;going green isn’t exactly&nbsp;as&nbsp;novel as you might think.</p>
<p>According to the Huffington Post, Medical Marijuana Inc., a company specializing in cannabis beauty products, <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marta-wohrle/cannabis-beauty-benefits_b_4533267.html"" target=""_blank"">launched an anti-aging beauty line featuring super-concentrated, cannabis-enriched hemp oil</a>&nbsp;as long ago as December 2013.</p>
<p>Now, even more companies are eagerly jumping on the green highway express to create their own cannabis skincare and haircare lines.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can get in on&nbsp;the latest, greatest and haziest craze.</p>
<h2>You’ve got the urge to herbal.</h2>
<p>Remember those hemp bracelets of yore? They’re not just good for identifying other stoners. As <a href=""https://www.truthinaging.com/article"" target=""_blank"">Truth In Aging&nbsp;points out</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Hemp is particularly ubiquitous in shampoos and conditioners as it is rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and is such a great emollient for hair.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href=""http://www.bustle.com/articles/34207-3-hemp-oil-uses-for-skincare-that-are-totally-legal-and-incredibly-effective"" target=""_blank"">Omega-3 and omega-6 are also essential for healthy skin</a> so really, it’s a win-win.</p>
<p>Forget the salon; look no&nbsp;further than your dealer for lustrous locks. The ingredients in cannabis can&nbsp;turn you into a total smoke-show.</p>
<hr>
<h2>You’ll never run dry.</h2>
<p>Hemp seed oil is great for hydrating your skin. Another weed-inspired company,&nbsp;<a href=""http://metro.co.uk/2015/02/20/could-this-new-cannabis-beauty-range-be-the-next-big-beauty-trend-5071349/"">Curan</a>, uses cannabidiol-rich hemp oil in its skin ointment, skin lotion and body oil.</p>
<p>As the Huffington Post notes, cannabis oil is packed with vitamins, antioxidants and easily absorbs into pores, which means it acts as an <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/08/pot-skin-care-line-apothecanna_n_2432898.html"" target=""_blank"">all-natural alternative</a> to moisturize dry skin, soothe inflammation and redness, and reduce signs of aging.</p>
<p>Dermatologist Zeichner <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2013/01/12/colorado-company-plans-pot-infused-skin-care-line/"" target=""_blank"">told ABC News</a>&nbsp;cannabis can even improve hydration, adding,</p>
<blockquote><p>The seeds of the cannabis plant are rich in nutrients and essential fatty acids. The oils can help hydrate the skin and improve skin barrier function.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>No more acne in this joint.</h2>
<p>Well… <em>hopefully</em>.</p>
<p>In a study published in the Federation of <a href=""http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-07/foas-tbo070208.php"" target=""_blank"">American Societies for Experimental Biology</a>, researchers in the UK, Germany and Hungary found THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the active ingredient&nbsp;in marijuana — the stuff getting you high —&nbsp;<span style=""color: #333333;"">is akin to &nbsp;“endocannabinoids,” a substance naturally created in&nbsp;the human body.</span></p>
<p>According to Metro, endocannabinoids are produced in&nbsp;the body to&nbsp;<a href=""http://metro.co.uk/2015/02/20/could-this-new-cannabis-beauty-range-be-the-next-big-beauty-trend-5071349/"" target=""_blank"">support our immune system and restore the health and balance of cells</a>; they’re also loaded with antiseptic, antibiotic and anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>This means the&nbsp;properties found in cannabis could help eliminate the bacteria causing acne and&nbsp;help your skin heal after a bad breakout.</p>
<hr>
<h2>It’s good to be in the weeds.</h2>
<p>Since marijuana is legal — for either&nbsp;recreational or medical use — in <a href=""http://www.governing.com/gov-data/state-marijuana-laws-map-medical-recreational.html"" target=""_blank"">23 states now</a>,&nbsp;Elle&nbsp;has created a <a href=""http://www.elle.com/beauty/makeup-skin-care/news/a15017/hemp-facial-diy/"" target=""_blank"">perfectly legal face mask</a> using hemp oil. Because THC is an antioxidant and an anti-inflammatory, applying it topically can have wondrous effects.</p>
<p>As an antioxidant, THC helps combat wrinkles and fine lines.</p>
<p>Scientists and dermatologists are currently studying ways THC could combat skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151400/Stocksy_txpcd7015d3EgW000_Small_334655-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/how-long-it-takes-to-be-woman/1069144/,Beauty,"By Society’s Standards, Here’s How Long It Takes To Look Like A Woman","<p>It’s a tough world out there for women, especially in the age of Pinterest.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, keeping yourself beautiful meant styled and set hair, watching your diet and keeping up a basic cosmetic routine.&nbsp;A decade later, beauty standards were even tougher: elaborate bouffants, dramatic eye makeup and more meant plenty of time spent in front of the bathroom mirror.</p>
<p>Thanks to a combination of beauty blogs, social media and celebrity endorsements, more information about glamour is available to women than ever before. In forums like MakeupAlley and specific Reddit threads (here’s looking at you, <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/makeupaddiction"" target=""_blank"">/r/MakeupAddiction</a>), devotees bond over a shared pastime.</p>
<p>After all, who doesn’t love a new product or polish color?</p>
<p>But, as we go deeper down the beauty troll hole, and as the range of options and increasingly specific products grows, so do our stress levels. At what point do we just give ourselves a break and accept the fact we’re not going to be bionic beauty specimens, from perfectly frizz-free head to buffed-and-manicured toe?</p>
<p>The fact is this: You don’t have to drink a green juice every morning or apply cuticle oil religiously to be beautiful. Pick and choose a few habits that are fulfilling and interesting to you, because no one could possibly accomplish it all.</p>
<p>Just for kicks, though, here’s what the average woman’s morning routine might look like if she followed every beauty tip in the book.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>5:00 am</strong>: Wake up naturally, without a sleep app.</span></p>

<p class=""p1""><strong>11:47 am:&nbsp;</strong>Give up.</p>

<p>So basically, it takes over seven hours to “look like a woman” by society’s standards — and that’s all before you’ve gotten dressed. Good news: We haven’t even gotten to the nighttime ritual…&nbsp;<em>yet</em>.</p>
<p>You can live by society’s rules (and endure a talking-to when you <em>finally</em> get into the office at 4:49 pm, once you’ve finished your&nbsp;breathing exercises and at-home chakra treatment) or&nbsp;you can take down your clippings of Blake Lively, give yourself a break&nbsp;and realize your inside shines more brightly than your outside.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/EliteDailyMakeup-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/unconventional-beauty-products-hydrogen-peroxide-baking-soda/,Beauty,Unconventional Beauty Products: Hydrogen Peroxide and Baking Soda,"<p>I’m a huge fan of at-home remedies and anything natural or organic. Some people may watch me perform some of my routine beauty rituals and shoot me a quizzical look. I assure you, they work. Years of experimenting have given me a quirky beauty regimen that I’d like to share with all of you.</p>
<p>Now not all of these are that different. You’ve probably heard of a few of these techniques. Honestly though, why are you going to spend excess amounts of money on products that don’t work as well as things you have laying around your house? Here are some of my favorite ways to use one of my favorite unconventional beauty products: <em>Hydrogen Peroxide and Baking Soda</em>.</p>
<p>I literally use hydrogen peroxide and baking soda for almost everything. Yes, these are common ingredients for fifth grade science fair volcanoes, but the combination of hydrogen peroxide and baking soda is useful for so much.</p>
<p>I use this combination mixed with toothpaste as a tooth whitener. Just mix the three ingredients together and brush your teeth, as you normally would once a week and I promise the results come quicker than whitening strips do.</p>
<p>Another way to use hydrogen peroxide and baking soda: to whiten your nails. Have you ever removed nail polish to find your nails stained? Of course you have, it’s one of the many woes of being a nail polish addict. Mix hydrogen peroxide and baking soda together to form a paste and brush the combination onto your nails. Leave on for ten minutes and wash off, your nails will be white and look just like new.</p>
<p>Use the hydrogen peroxide and baking soda paste as a facemask. No, really. It’s going to tingle (a lot) but five minutes of this paste on your skin will leave your skin glowing and radiant. It’s almost like an all-natural chemical peel that you can perform on yourself every week.</p>
<p>Finally, use just baking soda on your hair to remove product build up. In the shower, apply a handful of baking soda to your wet scalp&nbsp;and let it sit for five minutes. Wash the baking soda out. Your hair will feel so clean, and lightweight that you’ll want to perform this routine at least once a week.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/spray-numbs-pain-high-heels/,Beauty,Women Of The World Rejoice (Or Scowl) As This New Numbing Cream Makes Wearing High Heels Pain-Free,"<p>Why should women switch to a more comfortable, sensible shoe like flats when the thoughtful males of the world are inventing a spray to mask the pain of heels? Numb your pain, ladies. Numb your pain.</p>
<p>The newest product being marketed to vulnerable women everywhere is called “<strong>biochemistry Heel No Pain</strong>” for those who want to wear high heels without feeling the shoes’ uncomfortable pinch.</p>
<p>Created by — who else — a male plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, California (insert obviousness here) named&nbsp;<strong>Dr. Randal Haworth</strong>, the numbing cream contains the chemical lidocaine hydrochloride, which is used by doctors and dentists as a local anesthetic. Hmm, that sounds promising if our teeth were anything like our feet.</p>
<p>Some orthopedic doctors are skeptical of the biochemistry, saying that it only masks the pain and does not heal anything. Doctor Haworth, however, said that the spray (like his pick up lines) worked on about 70 percent of women who tried it.</p>
<p>What will they think of next!? High heels that we can actually walk in? No, heaven forbid we let women be that comfortable.</p>

<p><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/app/id912570794"" target=""_blank"">Carrot Hunger</a>&nbsp;comes&nbsp;to us straight from the gates of hell to say really mean sh*t about our weight, which is supposed&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>somehow</em> encourage us to keep to our diets.</p>
<p>Carrot Hunger tells you like it is without messing around.</p>
<p>According to <a href=""http://www.foodbeast.com/news/really-mean-calorie-counting-app-shames-and-insults-you-into-not-eating/"" target=""_blank"">Foodbeast</a>, Carrot Hunger greets you with the following uplifting message as you input your measurements: “Greetings meatbag.”</p>
<p>It then insults you based on how tall you are or based on how much you weigh.</p>
<p>The calorie-counting app allows you to input what you eat and keep track of your daily meals.</p>
<p>It continues to insult you each step of the away.</p>
<p>The app sets a limit for the amount of calories you’re allowed to consume daily, forcing you to “bribe” it with a .99 cent payment every time you screw up. As messed up as that is; it’s kind of a great marketing scheme.</p>
<p>As Hilary Pollack, editor of Munchies,&nbsp;reported after trying the app:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just to be a jerk, I try to tell the app that I have just consumed 11 Milky Way bars on top of my fairly decadent breakfast. This ‘snack’ pushes me far beyond my daily caloric limit. I’m given the option of bribing the app not to include it in my intake log for 99 cents (a smart monetization model, I will admit), or to ‘ACCEPT CONSEQUENCES.’</p></blockquote>
<p>But that’s not all; no sir. The app has an assortment of “punishments” at the ready for your lack of self-control, including publicly shaming you&nbsp;as well as putting rude ads on the bottom of the app to demonstrate your tendency towards eating everything you see.</p>
<p>After all of this depreciation, we have to wonder: Does the app actually work to help you shed pounds?</p>
<p>According to Pollack:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although I didn’t actually eat the near-dozen Milky Ways, I feel a little bit defensive, indignant, and (yes) ashamed. But truth be told, I kind of enjoy this sense of punishment; the interface is so jolly that it feels more like a playful mental spanking than an emotional beatdown.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, if you’re into feeling like sh*t about yourself at the hands of your smartphone, by all means give this app a try.</p>Carrot Hunger</div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151219/Stocksy_txp339a118awjW000_Small_574871-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/celebrity-makeup-artist/771826/,Beauty,The Inside Scoop From Famous Make-Up Artists: How To Look Like A Celebrity In Your Own Home,"<p>Between tabloids, TMZ and television, we are a celebrity-obsessed culture. And on the days we aren’t worshipping the latest starlet, we are trying to look like her. Because (to state the obvious) celebrities always look flawless, but <em>especially</em> when it comes to their makeup.</p>
<p>We were curious as to what makes them so spectacular, what these beauties are doing that we aren’t, and how much effort <em>really</em> goes into their appearances.</p>
<p>So, we went straight to the sources and talked to the prominent makeup artists who celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Jessica Chastain call their sidekicks.</p>
<p>Their perfection can almost seem unattainable, but these pros let us in on how it’s done. The makeup artists who work with a-listers all day also had some refreshing news — you’re more like a celebrity than you think you are.</p>
<p>Everything you’ve wanted to know, from clear skin, to contouring, to how much makeup is <em>actually</em> going on celebrity women’s faces, we got the inside scoop. And we had a ton of fun getting to know the incredible talent behind the world’s most recognizable faces.</p>
<p>Here’s the truth behind what it takes to make up an icon.</p>
<p><em>Editor’s note: These interviews have been edited and condensed for clarity.</em></p>
<h2>Fiona Stiles, The A-List Regular</h2>
<p><strong>Celeb Cred:</strong> Nikki Reed, Eva Mendez, Jessica Alba, Jessica Chastain, Kate Winslet, Kerry Washington, Zoe Saldana, Heidi Klum, Carine Roitfeld, Camilla Belle, Amy Adams… just to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>On working with celebrity clients:</strong><br>
Real women are much more particular about their looks. Actresses and models… their job is to be transformed and look like someone else. People can be particular, but real women are hesitant to break out of their routine. Whereas actresses are interested and are curious.</p>
<p><strong>On celebrity make-up regimes: </strong><br>
There’s no retouching on the red carpet, so you have to get it right the first time. You have to be careful about foundation and finding the exact color. It can’t be too luminous if the skin is oily. They have makeup on for hours. You have to consider skin type.</p>
<p>A lot of women don’t use highlighter and don’t contour. Those are two things that really make a difference in how you look in pictures and how you look in real life.</p>
<p>I use just a little bit of silvery highlighter so it gives me a wet look. And then I leave my cheekbones fairly unadorned. A little more gold tone to lighten the skin.</p>
<p>Contour powders are amazing as long as you find ones that are not too opaque, not heavily pigmented or like MAC contours — they are really intense. You want something with sheerness.</p>
<p><strong>On the TRUE amount of layers of product a celebrity wears: </strong><br>
We tend to use a lot of product because we’re going for effects. I might do contour and blush and it won’t look like that [heavy].</p>
<p>It’s about knowing how to shape someone’s face to be the most flattering version. I don’t like primer. I don’t like what it does to foundation. Foundation, highlighter and contour. As long as skin looks beautiful, you’re set.</p>
<p>I like moisturizer’s evenness for foundation.&nbsp;From there, a light translucent powder. And then contour blush. It depends on the skin and how old they are. Primer separates the foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Why you are more like a celebrity than you think:</strong><br>
We all have the same issues; 100 percent everyone has a pimple and a sunburn!</p>
<p><strong>On makeup versus airbrushing and retouching: </strong><br>
It depends on the publication. There’s a lot of retouching. When it’s done well, you can’t tell. It’s like an Instagram filter.</p>
<p>They remove excess freckles and change the tone of skin. Same for models.</p>
<p><strong>The look she is most proud of: </strong><br>
I’m proud of my relationship with the client. If my client is happy, I’m happy. (Pauses to consider.) Nikki Reed at the final “Twilight” premiere.</p>
<p><strong>On the time it takes to get a celebrity ready:</strong><br>
It’s about the same for both celebrities and average women. We tag team at the red carpet.</p>
<p>What would take me an hour is an hour and half because I’m working around the hair dresser.</p>
<p>If I’m getting a bride ready for her wedding, it takes three hours. She needs to go delegate, get up from the chair, come back.</p>
<p><strong>Make-up trends she loves and hates:</strong><br>
I love a strong brow or one you can’t see anymore. They’re always going to be timeless.&nbsp;I hate frosted lipstick. And very shimmery lip gloss.</p>
<p><strong>On her celebrity rate:</strong><br>
It’s so varied. Some days you work for zero and some days you work for a rate.</p>
<p><strong>In her make-up bag:</strong><br>
Luminizer, Givenchy foundation, Serat and Rubis tweezers. I’m highbrow-lowbrow like MAC lipstick and Chanel rouge allure velvet.</p>
<p>My greatest experiences are going to drugstores in other countries or a pharmacy in Europe. I don’t care if it’s two dollars or 400. It’s the thrill of the hunt, and new things that I love and are under-the-radar. That’s why I started my site.</p>
<p><strong>Where to get more Fiona and her coveted products:</strong><br>

<h2>Carmindy, The True Beauty Pro</h2>
<p><strong>Media cred:</strong> “What Not To Wear” on TLC; author of “The 5 Minute Face,” “Get Positively Beautiful,” and “Crazy Busy Beautiful”; Self, Cosmopolitan, InStyle, Essence, Lucky, Seventeen, Marie Claire, Glamour… she’s pretty much everywhere you want to be.</p>
<p><strong>On the celebrity advantage:</strong><br>
New technology. They are being given — from beauty experts and makeup artists and professional hairdressers and dermatologists — the newest technology. Besides lighting, foundation is the highest level of technology that hasn’t been seen yet.</p>
<p>It’s new extensions that only the top hair extension guru is doing at the moment. Tape extensions is a new one. New technology is why [celebrities] look a little bit better and more on top of their game.</p>
<p>I’ve been a make-up artist for over 25 years. Every company would send me products, but a lot of mainstream product lines aren’t advancements.</p>
<p>For instance, with foundation, Italy is the place to go. I went to top manufacturers. I now sell the “Game Changer” foundation. As a professional makeup artist, we know about new technologies.</p>
<p>It’s not that [celebrities] are any more special — they have more <em>access.&nbsp;</em>It’s cult things that I just found about on set. Secrets… you’re privy to the cutting edge stuff.</p>
<p><strong>On the differences between celebrities and the “real world” women:</strong><br>
There are no differences. (Editor’s note: Bless you, Carmindy!). Women think that these women have and look this way every day.</p>
<p>Celebrity women age and get broken capillaries and sunspots and everything else. They might have more access to get the treatments.</p>
<p>When I made my stand a few years ago, everyone was telling these women how to look like celebrities. I was telling them the same makeup tips and tricks for everybody.</p>
<p>I tell my ladies, <em>Listen, if you all of a sudden decide not to be a housewife, and all of a sudden you’re famous — </em>you’re <em>the celebrity.&nbsp;</em>The only difference is that [celebrities] are recognizable.</p>
<p><strong>On TV versus red carpet makeup:</strong><br>
There’s a difference with HDTV. Television makeup has changed. It used to be heavier like stage makeup, but with HD it’s much lighter.</p>
<p>The way you wear makeup for daytime is like television these days. In terms of texture, you want to keep it sheer because it shows everything.</p>
<p>Red carpet is different. Lights are brighter, flashes are going on. It’s heavier.</p>
<p><strong>The REAL amount of time it takes to prep:</strong><br>
It’s the same amount of time [for celebrities and clients]: an hour. Getting ready for an event should be fun, not a stressful nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>A look that Carmindy is most proud of:</strong></p>
<p>I’m most proud of (her signature) <a href=""http://carmindy.com/makeup/5-min-face-kit"" target=""_blank"">‘Five Minute Face.’</a> It’s a whole cosmetic kit that took a lot of time and effort for what it is. I really studied it.</p>
<p>What makes a woman most beautiful is not looking like a celebrity or model. What makes her look at her peak, most desirable is when she’s completely in love or aroused. Eyes are intense, skin is flushed and glowing and lips are engorged with blood.</p>
<p><strong>The steps it takes to mimic celebrity makeup:</strong><br>
It’s all about the layering. That’s what women get wrong. The order is what’s going to keep you looking spectacular and fresh.</p>
<p>These makeup artists do not go to the event with the celebrity. Why do they look so great at end of night? It’s applied properly through specific steps.</p>
<p>First and foremost: Face primer. Oily or dry, primer evens everything out. It smooths everything and creates the right canvas.</p>
<p>Second step: Apply foundation. Foundation instead of concealer first. This is the new way. You use less concealer. Foundation over concealer creates cakiness.</p>
<p>Use concealer while face is still moist. Then add a light layer of powder to set everything. Foundation on eyelids acts like a primer – it’s just repackaged concealer.</p>
<p>Carmindize: It’s my signature <a href=""http://carmindy.com/highlighter-duo"" target=""_blank"">Carmindizing highlighter duo</a>. On celebrities on camera it looks fantastic. I do it on every woman. This is the celebrity trick.</p>
<p>Highlighter powder or cream in a champagne color or shimmery pinky white. Apply underneath the eyebrow, on the inside corner of the eye, and on the top of your cheek bones. Those three key places. You get a totally amazing celebrity glow.</p>
<p>After that brows, eyes, lips. Those steps set the tone.</p>
<p><strong>Make-up trends she loves and hates:</strong><br>
Hate: Really, really dark, berry matte lipstick. Although it’s sexy on a runway and an 18-year-old model, most women can’t pull it off.</p>
<p>It makes their lips recede and looks harsh and older. Pink eyeshadow, too. It makes you look like you have the worst allergic reaction in the world. Like itchy.</p>
<p>Love: The fact that we’re getting away from contouring and using highlighter instead is my dream and my mission. Lip crayons. I love lip crayons. You never have to use color lipliner.</p>

<h2>Mario Dedivanovic, The Sought-After Icon</h2>
<p><strong>Celeb bestie:</strong> Kim Kardashian, ’nuff said.</p>
<p><strong>On why you don’t look like a celebrity when you leave your house:</strong><br>
We use products to contour and highlight. We’re defining features. I think most average women don’t use that stuff the way a makeup artist uses on a client. Most celebrities wear false lashes.</p>
<p><strong>How his clients always look beautifully flawless:</strong><br>
With foundation and concealer. It’s all about the technique. I use a foundation and a concealer and plant everything well using the beauty blender sponge. That’s the key to get everything flawless — blend everything really well.</p>
<p><strong>On working with celebrities:</strong><br>
I don’t work that much with non-celebrity women. It’s different because [celebrities] are so heavily photographed. Their needs are different. We work together with celebrity stylists and hairstylists. It’s a team effort to come up with a look.</p>
<p><strong>The amount of time it takes to get his clients looking glam:</strong><br>
Twenty minutes to an hour.</p>
<p><strong>What he loves about Kim’s face (besides, like, everything):</strong><br>
She is gorgeous. I do love her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Favorite products from Kim’s line:</strong><br>
I love the individual eyelashes they have. They are the perfect size and easy to apply. I love their honey lip glosses — the nude colors are really pretty.</p>
<p><strong>A look that Mario is most proud of (if you can choose just one…):</strong><br>
Her wedding with Kanye West. It was a beautiful look, I really loved that one.</p>
<p>There’s one that we both love from Miami, it was an event for the Superbowl a few years back. Also another was from Khloe’s “Unbreakable” fragrance launch party in LA.</p>
<p><strong>Make-up trends he loves and hates:</strong><br>
I don’t follow trends. If you want to go with trends, there are subtle ways to do it. I don’t hate that much. I think all looks are pretty good depending on how it’s done. (Editor’s note: Did we mention how cool Mario is?)</p>
<p><strong>In his make-up kit:</strong><br>
My MAKE UP FOR EVER concealer, Shu Uemura lash curler, Orgasm blush by NARS, black smolder by MAC and beauty blender.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/5-expert-tips-kick-metabolism-high-gear-photos/839332/,Beauty,5 Expert Tips To Kick Your Metabolism Into High Gear After A Big Meal,"<p>You wake up the day after Thanksgiving feeling bloated and sluggish, with a giant food baby pushing over the top of your pants.</p>
<p>The memories of mashed potatoes, gravy and pumpkin pie being shoveled down your throat are foggy at best.</p>
<p>What did you eat? <em>Oh, just everything you could get&nbsp;your hands on.</em></p>
<p>It’s the holidays, after all. Thanksgiving is one of the only days of the year a girl gets to say, “f*ck my diet and pass me the turkey — all the turkey — and the stuffing; hell, just give me the whole damn table of food.”</p>
<p>And now&nbsp;those feelings of food guilt are kicking in as you pull yourself out of your childhood bed and drag your overstuffed self back to reality. You likely consumed more calories yesterday than you have in the past six months.</p>
<p>The only thing to do is damage control, to try and kick your body back into gear so you’re able to put your skinny jeans on and face the rest of your life.</p>
<p>You can indulge again at Christmas, but for now, here are some excellent tips from health expert Ricki Friedman of <a href=""http://www.breaktheweight.com"" target=""_blank"">Break The Weight</a> on how to kick your metabolism into gear the day <em>after</em> your relentless chowdown on Thanksgiving.</p>
<h2>Keep a bottle of water nearby.</h2>
<p>Water is key to jumpstarting your metabolism after a day of heavy eating and drinking.</p>
<p>Friedman points out, “Water helps us digest all that crappy food we may have put into our bodies,” which will help you flush out your system.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Take that hike you’ve been talking about for months.</h2>
<p>Friedman is sure to take a walk after any big meal because, “it gives my body the opportunity to digest, burn some calories and feel less full.” So after your Thanksgiving feast, walk for at least 10 minutes — it’ll help you get your body back on track.</p>
<p>Friedman is also a fan of interval training: 15-20 minutes of intense exercise, “This type of workout will get your heart pumping, body sweating and calories burning.”</p>
<p>Sweating it out is key in recovering from your holiday binge eating,</p>
<blockquote><p>Sweating is an awesome way to get rid of toxins and pumpkin pie. So get moving!</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Don’t skip meals. Instead, eat more often.</h2>
<p>As Friedman points out, skipping out on eating the day after your Thanksgiving pig-out will only do your metabolism harm. Have six, small meals the following day and “think of them as bigger-sized snacks.”</p>
<p>Friedman also points out you should avoid pressing snooze in favor of indulging in breakfast before 9 am. You won’t just jumpstart your metabolism, you’ll also naturally prevent overeating during the day.</p>
<p>An early worm-inspired breakfast will ensure that you eat a lighter, healthier dinner later on.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The leftovers might look good, but they’re not helping.</h2>
<p>You’re probably thinking it’s safe to snack on a little leftover turkey&nbsp;and some roasted veggies, right? And, I mean, mashed potatoes are&nbsp;<em>technically</em> good for you, so a helping of those is safe too, right? Wrong.</p>
<p>While the leftovers might be tempting, Friedman suggests filling up on heart-healthy foods your body can easily digest.</p>
<p>Green tea and water with lemon help amp up your metabolism; Greek yogurt is a natural probiotic, so it’s excellent for the digestive system (aka: pushing all that bad stuff out of your body); egg whites provide a steady stream of protein; and beans and lentils keep you feeling full for longer because they are high in fiber instead of empty carbohydrates.</p>
<p>And now that you’re getting yourself back on track physically, maybe do some good for your soul and give all those leftovers to your local homeless shelter.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Cheating on your diet is actually pretty healthy.</h2>
<p>It’s OK&nbsp;to splurge once in a while, especially around the holidays when food is plentiful and goodies are everywhere. Though you might&nbsp;feel like you’ve self-sabotaged, get back on the horse. Friedman says,</p>
<blockquote><p>Don’t throw in the towel or give up on your healthy journey because you had a few bad nights of eating.</p></blockquote></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151400/Stocksy_txpcd7015d3EgW000_Small_334655-800x400.jpg

<h2>5. The Wet Brush</h2>

<hr>
<h2>8. ghd Eclipse</h2>
<p>Fun Fact: According to the professionals behind the brand, 365 degrees is the optimum temperature for straightening hair.</p>
<p>Anything less will dry out your hair and anything hotter than 419 degrees will cause the keratin protein in your hair to melt.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <a href=""http://www.ghdhair.com/us/ghd-eclipse/ghd-eclipse-styler?PID=PRO-025&amp;CRE=ghd_eclipse&amp;PLA=2&amp;TYPE=ghd_eclipse_level"" target=""_blank"">ghd Eclipse</a>‘s&nbsp;tri-zone technology keeps the temperature consistent through sensors that&nbsp;gauge&nbsp;how well your hair absorbs heat.

<h2>9. Bourjois Magic Nail Polish Remover</h2>
<p>The sponge soaked in <a href=""http://www.feelunique.com/p/Bourjois-Magic-Nail-Polish-Remover-75ml"" target=""_blank"">Bourjois’&nbsp;Acetone-free formula</a> takes off your polish in the same amount of time it takes you to dip nail polish remover onto a cotton ball.</p>
<p>This remover circumvents any traditional nail polish remover problems, like messing up the rest of your nails while holding the soaked cotton ball.</p>
<p>While it’s not ideal for glitter polish — sparkles need the extra strength from the Acetone — it’s perfect for removing chipped polish in no time.</p>
<hr>
<h2>10. Schwarzkopf Ultimate Color</h2>
<p><a href=""http://www.schwarzkopf.com.au/skau/en/home/hair_colour/colour_products/ultimate-colour.html"" target=""_blank"">This is the first ever permanent dye that can be used more than once</a>.</p>

<p>Summer is right around the corner, which means the Instagram photos are making an early debut. From fitness results to bikini pictures, all I’ve seen for the past two weeks are ribcages and flat butts. While our society has always praised the skin and bones look, I think it’s time we retire it and bow down to reality. That’s right ladies, this summer is about curves.</p>
<p>Men have repeatedly shown their devout love for a big ass… And that’s not something you can get with starving yourself everyday until June.</p>
<p>Kim Kardashian or Lindsay Lohan. Who’s sexier? Although she has been slammed for her growing pregnant body lately… Kim’s curves are to die for! A body that can fill out a bikini and show off a womanly shape is far more attractive than the saggy-assed bottoms we see on the girls who strive to look like a tree branch.</p>
<p>There was a time period over the last few years where curves were simply considered “fat” and “unattractive.” But in 2013, those ridiculous adjectives have been replaced with “sexy” and “confident.” If you’re lucky enough to have curves, show them off!</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with eating healthy and exercising, it does tone our tummies and give us to-die-for legs. But when looking like the Olsen twins circa 2005 is your destination, you have to be snapped back to reality. Guys want thickness, it makes a woman just that much more feminine and attractive.</p>
<p>So put down the lettuce and enjoy that cheeseburger that you know you’re craving. There’s nothing wrong with having curves. Be confident, it will just make you that much more seductive while you walk the beach in a hot little bikini. (But not a childish yellow polka dot one, we’re aiming for hip-hugging, not teddy-bear-hugging).</p>
<p>Oh and men — you’re welcome.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/sorry-sorry-xx-beauty-trends-makeup-trends-women-shouldnt-apologize-man-repelling-makeup-trends-stick/634818/,Beauty,"Sorry, Not Sorry: 14 Makeup Trends Women Should Never Have To Apologize For","<p>We love makeup. Sometimes we even plan our outfits around our makeup and not the other way around. So when someone else tries to tell us what we can and cannot experiment with, well, we don’t even bat a (fake) eyelash.</p>
<p>Beauty trends come and go, but your personal style lasts forever. And if that means wearing “Showgirls” lip liner with green eyeshadow, and totally working it, then you certainly don’t need to explain yourself.</p>
<p>Plus, the keepers are those who love you regardless if you’ve got your face on… or, er, your <em>real</em> face on.</p>
<p>And remember, it’s only makeup people.</p>
<p>Here are the 14 man-repelling, “controversial” makeup trends that, #sorrynotsorry, but we’re sticking to!</p>
<h2>1. Red Lipstick</h2>
<p>Perhaps this is why Marilyn had so many suitors — men hated kissing her rouge-stained lips. But there’s a reason why red lipstick is a timeless classic, and it doesn’t involve appeasing the guys of the world.</p>
<p>It’s because red lips look good on everyone! If your outfit is missing something, a little lip action always does the trick. So pucker up and stop mouthing off — this look is here to stay.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. Fake Eyelashes</h2>
<p>Her style might be questionable, but there’s no denying that Kim Kardashian’s eyelashes are on point, albeit fake. (Hey, you can’t expect everything to be real with those ASSets on reality TV…)</p>
<p>And while some people might think that too much will give you whiplash, we’d argue that fake eyelashes are a must-have accessory. If they’re good enough for Kanye, they’re good enough for us!</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Looking Orange</h2>
<p>Take a page from the Oompa Loompas and Netflix hit series: Orange is in! And, (insert mom voice here), with the growing risk of skin cancer, it’s a lot safer to be fake-tanned to a cheese crisp than it is to be tanned to a real crisp.</p>
<p>Plus, your selfie just got a whole lot more interesting now that you can change colors.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Full Brows</h2>
<p>We can’t believe we’re even defending this, given the popularity of model-turned-icon Cara Delevingne and smoldering smokeshow Penelope Cruz. Full brows are not only naturally sexy, they’re also a really great way to bring back the bush.</p>
<p>Anyone who doesn’t like your eyebrows needs to re-examine his priorities in life, just sayin’.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. Poorly-Blended Concealer</h2>
<p>Uh, would our red pimples and blemishes and dark spots be better alternatives? We’re not Beyoncé here, we don’t wake up #flawless. Cut us a break, at least we tried!</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. Violet Ombre Hair Dye</h2>
<p>Colored ombre is basically the hairstyle equivalent of that really hot girl in a sports bra and short shorts at the gym.</p>
<p>It says, “I’m really pretty and I’m confident and I know this because my hair is purple and I’m pulling it off.” Now, who’s going to mess with that kind of attitude?</p>
<hr>
<h2>7. Colored Eyeliner</h2>
<p>You can’t help what looks good on you, and if that’s sparkly green eyeliner at the moment, then you go for it girl! Perhaps your 12-year-old self lost in the Sephora aisle was onto something…</p>
<hr>
<h2>8. Artistic Nails</h2>
<p>The nail art trend is still alive and in full force, and to be honest, we’re not all that unhappy about it. It’s a much more creative way to give someone the finger.</p>
<hr>
<h2>9. Obvious Foundation</h2>
<p>Recall that heinous photo of Katy Perry right as she woke up. Yeah, that pretty much sums up our case for laying on the foundation in the morning. Like chocolate, sometimes more is actually better.</p>
<hr>
<h2>10. Dark Lipstick</h2>
<p>Lorde knows a thing or two when it comes to lip service, and her signature dark lipstick is no exception. Deep berry hues are seductive, stand-out and sultry.</p>
<p>So next time someone tries to tell you differently, remember, <em>we’re on each other’s team</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>11. Glitter</h2>
<p>If you want to sparkle, why should anyone tell you otherwise? Who cares if you look like 30-going-on-13 Britney Spears backup dancer? Those girls have moves, too!</p>
<hr>
<h2>12. Contoured Blush</h2>
<p>If someone has a problem with your amazing makeup job, just turn the other cheek. Those high cheekbones aren’t going to contour themselves!</p>
<hr>
<h2>13. Blue Eyeshadow</h2>
<p>We’re all for being bold, especially when it comes to your eyeshadow. Who cares what color it is? And for anyone who doesn’t like it — you have full permission to give ‘em the stink eye.</p>
<hr>
<h2>14. Heavy, Smoky Eyes</h2>
<p>It’s one way to get yourself looking like a total smokeshow, <em>amIright</em>!? But seriously, rock out with your black out, just, um, be careful of actually blacking out…</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151053/Stocksy_txp90d7348fhuW000_Small_446656-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/10-drug-store-beauty-products-millennial-girls-will-love/858567/,Beauty,Beauty On A Budget: 10 Drug Store Beauty Buys For 20-Something Women,"<p>Women are blessed in that we get to play around with makeup to make us look our very best; whereas men have to just deal with the bare&nbsp;face with which they were born.</p>
<p>While women are&nbsp;not forced to wear makeup, it’s still a lot of fun, and there’s a lot we can do with it. The issue with makeup, though, is there are so many different things we want to buy; yet, we have very limited budgets.</p>
<p>We ladies face a bit of a disadvantage in the hygiene department in general because we have more sensitive skin and, therefore, need many more beauty products in order to keep our skin looking radiant and our makeup looking flawless.</p>
<p>With limited funds to devote to our beauty regimens, it’s important to be savvy with our purchases.</p>
<p>Though we would love to spend all of our free time perusing Sephora and have the luxury of&nbsp;spending $25+ on eye shadow, that just isn’t realistic.</p>
<p>Elite Daily&nbsp;teamed up with professional makeup artist,&nbsp;<a href=""http://instagram.com/badgirl_beatty"" target=""_blank"">Sarah-Jane Beatty</a> of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sjmuartistry"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Jane Makeup Artistry</a> to get the skinny on the best drug store beauty buys for Millennial ladies.</p>
<h2>Must-Have Face Mask</h2>Blue Mercury
<p>In the winter, with the blistering wind battering our skin and drying it out, it’s important to invest in regular face mask treatments to keep&nbsp;our skin looking its best.</p>
<p>Beatty recommends the <strong>M-61 Power Glow Peel,</strong>&nbsp;available at BlueMercury.com.</p>
<blockquote><p>For $28 for 10 treatments, it’s quite the steal and will get you through this freezing season. I don’t think I’ve ever experienced such immediate results in my skin with anything else.</p>
<p>Glycolic and Salicylic Acid exfoliate while Chamomile and Vitamin K soothe your skin.</p></blockquote>
<p>The treatments will leave your skin with an even tone and texture. Sign us up!</p>
<hr>
<h2>Spread on the Moisturizer</h2>Simple
<p>With&nbsp;our skin&nbsp;especially prone to dryness during this time of year, a girl has to rely on a great moisturizer to keep her skin&nbsp;feeling&nbsp;supple.</p>
<p>Try <strong>Simple Replenishing Rich</strong> <strong>Moisturizer</strong> for just $10.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Beatty says:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was very pleased to find the Simple product line gave me the right amount of moisture with zero skin irritation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Beatty also adds that this cream is especially perfect for acne prone skin.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Eye Cream is a Must</h2>Neutrogena
<p>Now that we’re in our 20s, we need to start using eye cream. The skin around the eyes is some of the most sensitive and, therefore, prone to wrinkles.</p>
<p><strong>Neutrogena Healthy Eye</strong>&nbsp;<strong>C</strong><strong>ream</strong> is ophthalmologist tested and hypoallergenic; this cream won’t cause unwanted irritation.</p>
<p>Beatty assures that it “leaves your eye area hydrated and firm, while reducing fine lines and reducing dark circles.”</p>
<p>It’s perfect for the night owl and comes in at a low price point among the competition at $13.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Never Start a&nbsp;Makeup Routine Without the Right BB Cream</h2>NYX
<p>Before any makeup application can take place, it’s vital to protect your skin from the elements with a great BB cream.</p>
<p>This product&nbsp;can be pricey, but luckily, it&nbsp;doesn’t have to be. Beatty says&nbsp;<strong>NYX BB Cream</strong> is her go-to&nbsp;for $13.</p>
<p>She says it gives “beautiful sheer color and coverage, [and it’s] oil free and light enough that you don’t feel like you’re wearing anything.”</p>
<hr>
<h2>Foundation: the Base of all Things Beauty</h2>L’oreal
<p>When it comes to foundation, a girl needs full coverage and a natural color so she doesn’t end up looking like a clown.</p>
<p>Beatty recommends <strong>L’oreal&nbsp;True Match</strong>, which comes in warm neutral and cool shades, so that finding the perfect tone is made easy.</p>
<p>The matte coverage will also eliminate any unwanted shine — no one wants to look like a grease monkey.&nbsp;You can find this foundation for as low as $7.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Line Your Eyes like&nbsp;Catwoman</h2><a href=""http://beautyblogofakind.blogspot.com/2012/11/loreal-infallible-lacquer-liner-24h.html"" target=""_blank"">Makeup, Beauty &amp; More</a>
<p>For these freezing, wet months, you’ll need to line your eyes with something that will stay put. For Beatty, <strong>L’oreal Laquer Liner 24H</strong> in “Blackest Black” is the only way to go for $10:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyone who knows me knows I’m a huge fan of gel liner. It provides the precision of liquid, but the thicker texture allows you more control.</p>
<p>This L’oreal liner glides on smooth and has serious staying power … it also comes with a brush!</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>The Bigger the Lashes, the Better</h2>Maybelline
<p>Of course, the only way to follow up eyeliner is with a ball-busting mascara. Hunting down an&nbsp;affordable mascara might be one of the hardest parts of a Millennial girl’s beauty product roundup.</p>
<p>Luckily for us gals, Beatty has solved the mystery with <strong>Maybelline Great Lash Washable Mascara</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It has a big fluffy brush, much larger than the original, and never clumps — ever. Perfect for building huge voluminous lashes while maintaining separation and definition.</p></blockquote>
<p>How can you argue with that for $5?</p>
<hr>
<h2>Staying&nbsp;Sun-Kissed on Winter Days</h2><a href=""http://szafa.pl/c5501769-rimmel-natural-bronzer-022-sun-bronze.html"" target=""_blank"">Szafa</a>
<p>When the temperature drops to freezing levels and the sun is constantly hidden behind a haze of grey, your summer tan will fade and leave your skin as pasty as Elmer’s glue.</p>
<p>To combat this inevitability, we need to dab (emphasis on dab, Snooki) on a bit of bronzer to give our faces some much-needed color.</p>
<p>Beatty recommends <strong>Rimmel Natural Bronzer</strong>&nbsp;for $5, as it has a matte finish and&nbsp;doubles as a great contour powder.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Keep those Lips Kissably Soft</h2>Smith’s
<p>Keeping your lips soft and hydrated is an ongoing task in a girl’s life. Beatty recommends<strong> Smith’s Rosebud Salve</strong>&nbsp;for $6 and uses it herself every night as part of her bedtime beauty routine.</p>
<p>The subtle, pleasant smell and soft texture will delight your nose and keep your lips feeling velvety all day long.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Pout with&nbsp;the Color of a Minx</h2><br><a href=""http://eatinglipstick.blogspot.com/2013/05/elf-matte-lip-color-in-rich-red.html"" target=""_blank"">Eating Lipstick</a>
<p>For those big nights out, you’ll need a great lipstick you can depend on to get you through all those tequila shots and bargain cocktails. Try <strong>ELF Matte Lip Color</strong> in “Rich Red” at just $3 because, as Beatty puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p>[It’s a] stunning shade of red, easy to use twist up crayon, matte finish. Every girl should have a red lipstick on deck at all times, and at this price you can’t beat it.</p></blockquote>
<p>A girl in red lipstick is always a force to be reckoned with, and that is one fact all of us Millennial girls can relate&nbsp;to.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151056/Stocksy_txp90bc467fiuW000_Small_430889-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/items-millennial-girl-purse/929101/,Beauty,15 Items Every Millennial Girl Should Have In Her Purse At All Times,"<p>When you’re a young professional woman, you’re always on the go — running from the office to the gym, from the gym to drinks with friends, from the restaurant to the subway, from the train to that boy’s place…</p>
<p>As a result, our purses have inadvertently become tiny homes.</p>
<p>We feel compelled&nbsp;to carry around all of our essentials because we never know when we’re going to stop home, or what we’re going to need next.</p>
<p>Every Millennial woman needs those&nbsp;<em>clutch</em> items in her bag to get her from apartment to desk to happy hour in one, gliding movement. We don’t have time to slow down for&nbsp;uncontrollable bangs or a lack of lip&nbsp;balm; there’s just too much world to digest!</p>
<p>We got an&nbsp;inside&nbsp;peek into the purses of a group of 20-something women to find out which accessories&nbsp;they rely on to keep going without a hitch.</p>
<h2>1. Sometimes, you forget that one important step in the morning, in which case,&nbsp;make sure you have…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Travel deodorant! There will be a day when you forget to apply deodorant and you will thank me for this advice. I use Dove Cool Essentials. If you don’t remember&nbsp;to use deodorant and already smell bad, this has enough of a scent to mask it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emily A., 23, carries an <a href=""https://www.everlane.com/collections/mens-all/products/mens-twill-tote-reverse-denim"" target=""_blank"">Everlane tote</a> to the office.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. When your skin is chapped from the cold wind, always carry…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Hand lotion! Preferably any that has a delicious scent.&nbsp;Cracked knuckles are so painful and seem to suddenly strike at the most random times. Moisturize your skin to get it all soft, and then rub the excess on your neck so you smell good when someone hugs you. I like classic Nivea. That’s my favorite.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alexia L., 21, brings&nbsp;a sporty backpack to the office so she can hit the gym after work.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3.&nbsp;A girl can get away with anything, as long as she’s wearing the right shade of…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Lipstick.&nbsp;I won’t go anywhere without my Revlon Super Lustrous lipstick. Their Mink shade is natural enough to give my lips an effortless-looking dark hue. I use it all time! I’ll be the first to admit I wear it to the gym, the grocery store and around my apartment.</p>
<p>Even if other people can’t tell the difference or no one else sees it, it makes me feel pretty and confident to have lips that pop.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kelley L., 23, shrugs&nbsp;a large <a href=""https://www.lulus.com"" target=""_blank"">LuLu</a> tote in black to the office/gym/grocery store.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4.&nbsp;When you can’t help but wear those new, fabulous heels, be sure to remember…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Band-Aids for blisters.&nbsp;I keep them on me because I have a thing with&nbsp;socks; I’m <em>never</em> wearing the right ones. So during winter, I always have cuts on my ankles, and in spring I never break-in my shoes before wearing them… which only means more cuts. Since I live in NYC, I walk everywhere.</p>
<p>Instead of having an excuse to pay for cabs, or waiting forever for the subway, I stick these in my bag so I can continue strolling. I always have them just in case.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kylie M., 26, lugs a <a href=""http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=34181818&amp;parentid=W_ACC_BAGS#/"" target=""_blank"">medium-sized tote</a> to the office.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5.&nbsp;And, when you just can’t stop pressing snooze before your shower, grab…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Dry shampoo is my saving grace and both volumizes and degreases my hair.&nbsp;Batiste&nbsp;is, hands down, my favorite. I use it daily to add volume to my roots and completely refresh next-day hair — aka when I&nbsp;don’t feel like showering.</p>
<p>If you’re going out after work, it can give your hair a little pick-me-up, too.</p></blockquote>
<p>Elizabeth B., 25, brings a backpack&nbsp;or a tote to work/gym/dinner/bars.</p>
<hr>
<h2>6.&nbsp;And, if running&nbsp;on 2 percent makes you nervous, make sure you remember your…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Phone charger.</p>
<p>I’m socially awkward and hate having to ask people to borrow theirs. Plus, I hate when people ask me for mine; I’m secretly scared they won’t return it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Laura A., 24, carries a large, blue tote to the office.</p>
<hr>
<h2>7.&nbsp;Listen to Mom’s advice and always carry…</h2>
<blockquote><p>At least two forms of money for life’s unexpected moments.&nbsp;I’d never forget two forms of currency: cash, credit, debit, gift card, anything — because of my anxiety about spontaneous disasters.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alexis G., 24, shuffles a black <a href=""http://www1.macys.com/shop/handbags-accessories/michael-michael-kors?id=27726&amp;edge=hybrid"" target=""_blank"">Michael Kors</a> tote to the office.</p>
<hr>
<h2>8. To keep your lips soft for your&nbsp;cute coffee date, don’t forget…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Chapstick! You never know who you’re going to end up kissing later at the bar.&nbsp;I prefer&nbsp;medicated Blistex. I use it every morning before I get on the subway, after lunch and before drinks with friends. It keeps my lips soft when it’s so cold out!</p></blockquote>
<p>Diana R., 24, uses a small, navy and tan clutch to travel to and from the&nbsp;office.</p>
<blockquote><p>I swear by EOS Smooth Sphere Lip Balm;&nbsp;I use it on a daily basis. It isn’t the most moisturizing lip balm I’ve used, but it’s good for emergency scenarios or a quick fix. Mine never leaves my bag, unless it’s on my desk at work. My work bag is also my gym bag/carryall, so I’m always losing things in it.</p>
<p>But, because this lip balm is bright and bigger than just a tube of Chapstick, I can always find it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lydia M., 23,&nbsp;brings&nbsp;a black, boho bag to the office.</p>
<hr>
<h2>9.&nbsp;For moisture and a hint of color…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Tinted lip balm has you covered.&nbsp;I love Fresh Lip Sugar Treatment in plum. The color is a nice, sheer berry hue that works well for everyday wear, since it’s not too pigmented. It adds just the right amount of color and shine to be noticeable, but not so&nbsp;much you need to worry about fading or reapplying.</p>
<p>It’s my go-to because my lips are really sensitive and get chapped easily, so I always need to carry around a Chapstick, and since it’s tinted, it almost doubles as a lip gloss, saving me from carrying around extra stuff.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gillian F., 21, carries a big black purse to the office.</p>
<hr>
<h2>10.&nbsp;To fight dark circles when you’re out on the town, always have…</h2>
<blockquote><p>NARS concealer.</p>
<p>Apply it directly to your under eye area instead of mixing it with a liquid concealer and using your finger, which takes too much time — aka, this is perfect for when you spend the night at random places.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brittany L., 23, totes&nbsp;a medium <a href=""http://www1.bloomingdales.com/shop/coach/coach-handbags/Handbag_size/Medium?id=1001877"" target=""_blank"">Coach bag</a> to the office.</p>
<hr>
<h2>11.&nbsp;A lady should always smell as good as she looks, so spritz…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Perfume: I never leave the house without it.</p>
<p>The best way to go is with samples or with a small refillable container, which is great for brands that&nbsp;don’t have rollers on their samples. I love Gucci Guilty&nbsp;because it fits perfectly in my bag and has the convenient roller-ball on the end.</p></blockquote>
<p>Teddie A., 21, prefers a large, classic Louis tote to bring to the office/class.</p>
<hr>
<h2>12.&nbsp;When you’re wearing the right lip color, but don’t want it to run…</h2>
<blockquote><p>I use the Original Cocoa Butter Balm Stick by Palmer’s because it isn’t sticky or scented. It’s my go-to because I know it won’t smudge my lipstick when I’m out for the night.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sarah S., 25, brings&nbsp;a <a href=""http://www.nastygal.com"" target=""_blank"">Nasty Gal</a>&nbsp;backpack to the office/happy hour.</p>
<hr>
<h2>13. When&nbsp;your hair gets out of control…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Bobby pins are a saving grace.</p>
<p>I always carry bobby pins in my purse because I never know when my bangs are going to start acting straight-up crazy on me and need to be holstered. I get the ones at CVS for like $5 because I lose them all the time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Michelle L., 28, choses&nbsp;a small green backpack for&nbsp;the office.</p>
<hr>
<h2>14.&nbsp;When you need to touch up your eyes, don’t forget your…</h2>
<blockquote><p>Mascara and eyeliner.</p>
<p>I bring them as a combo. Before heading to happy hour, it’s super important to make sure your liner isn’t smudged and your lashes look fresh. I’m in love with Lash-Stiletto by Maybelline and I use whatever cheap-o purple eyeliner I can find at CVS.</p>
<p>Purple also helps bring out the green in my eyes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gigi E., 24, shrugs&nbsp;a large, black vintage tote to the office/dinners.</p>
<hr>
<h2>15.&nbsp;And, since you never know where you might end up…</h2>
<blockquote><p>A hairbrush is a must.</p>
<p>I carry around a little hairbrush because I never know what the wind situation is going to be outside. It’s also really helpful if you sleep over at your boyfriend’s house because it’s not like he owns one.</p></blockquote>
<p>Olivia N., 23, carries a medium laptop bag to the office.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151233/Stocksy_txp4193b432VqW000_Small_573950-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/lauren-conrad-paving-way-anti-body-shaming-movement/1051773/,Beauty,How Lauren Conrad Is Paving The Way For An Anti-Body Shaming Movement,"<p>Beach season is here: the time of crash diets, working out overtime and going on detox diets galore to look “skinny” in your&nbsp;bikini.</p>
<p>Lauren Conrad knows what’s up, and thinks the body shaming that emerges with the start of swimsuit season is overrated.</p>
<p>Her recent <a href=""http://laurenconrad.com/blog/2015/06/letter-from-lauren-june-shape-up/"" target=""_blank"">blog post on June 1</a>&nbsp;highlighted how she feels people should make an effort to be healthy year-round, and the site will no longer be using so-called “body-shaming” terms.</p>
<p><a href=""http://laurenconrad.com/blog/2015/06/letter-from-lauren-june-shape-up/"" target=""_blank"">LaurenConrad.com will be replacing common “body-shaming” terms</a> such as “skinny,” “slim” and “thin,” with more health-oriented terms such as, “fit,” “toned” and “healthy.”</p>
<p>This comes just a few days after Lilly Pulitzer was criticized for <a href=""http://time.com/3896975/lilly-pulitzer-cartoons-fat-shaming/"" target=""_blank"">photographs of&nbsp;fat-shaming cartoons</a> posted around an employee’s office cubicle.</p>
<p>Lauren Conrad, can we just say thank you?&nbsp;Thank you to you and your team for spearheading this anti body-shaming movement.</p>
<h2>The End Of “Skinny”</h2>
<p>We live in this culture of constant body criticism and false ideals printed across magazines and the Internet.</p>
<p>Words like “skinny,” “slim” and “thin” may seem harmless, but have done much more damage than many of us think.</p>
<p>This desire to be “thin” or “skinny” is the reason why <a href=""http://www.anad.org/get-information/about-eating-disorders/eating-disorders-statistics/"" target=""_blank"">over 24 million</a> people in the United States suffer from an eating disorder.</p>
<p>This is why <a href=""http://www.anad.org/get-information/about-eating-disorders/eating-disorders-statistics/"" target=""_blank"">91 percent of women</a> on a college campus have attempted to control their weight through dieting.</p>
<p>This is why countless people have become preoccupied with image, and can’t enjoy the amazing experiences life has to offer.</p>
<p>We may all pretend we don’t body shame, but <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jessi-andricks/body-shaming_b_7050302.html"" target=""_blank"">almost all of us</a> have done it or do it regularly. Negative self-talk seems second-nature to many nowadays.</p>
<p>We all have some idea of what&nbsp;we want to look like and how we want to be perceived.</p>
<p>So we diet; we detox; we try to be perfect … for what?&nbsp;All it does is&nbsp;backfire, leaving us feeling judged and unhappy.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Negative Self-Talk Is Unproductive</h2>
<p>What good does body-shaming do?</p>
<p>Typically, nothing productive comes out of negative self-talk. Obsessing over the imperfections and flaws doesn’t bring about any good.</p>
<p>Let’s end this vicious cycle.</p>
<p>As <a href=""http://laurenconrad.com/blog/2015/06/letter-from-lauren-june-shape-up/"" target=""_blank"">Lauren preached</a>, being healthy is something we should focus on year-round.</p>
<p>Health is a lifestyle, not a seasonal fad. Exercising regularly, eating well and engaging in activities that make us happy each and every day is what creates good health.</p>
<p>What we think, we become. What we focus on, we create.</p>
<p>Focusing on our language and words is the first step toward ending body-shaming.</p>
<p>Let’s stop emphasizing dieting, and change our mindset to focus on&nbsp;proper nutrition.</p>
<p>Why are we idolizing certain body types? Let’s embrace what we have, and work with what we have.</p>
<p>Why are we criticizing people for being too skinny or too fat? Worry about yourself; the world already has enough critics.</p>

<h2>Beauty Is A State Of Mind</h2>
<p>Don’t let what you see in the mirror become distorted by a socially constructed beauty ideal.&nbsp;We all have different ideals of beauty.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, beauty is a state of mind.</p>
<p>Just be you, and be the best you that you can be. Why be a second-grade version of someone else, when you can be a first-grade version of yourself?</p>
<p>A&nbsp;brilliant mind, a stunning heart, a captivating soul and a fierce drive are all unique characteristics that make us beautiful.</p>
<p>This movement will no doubt take off. If major contemporary&nbsp;magazines geared toward body image like Shape, Marie Claire and Cosmopolitan are smart, they will implement this practice as well.</p>
<p>Embracing our bodies and choosing to be positive about our health is the new norm.</p>
<p>Thank you, Lauren Conrad and team, for your bravery and innovation.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wenn5568057-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/tanning-is-bad-for-you-how-to-rock-the-pale/,Beauty,Tanning Is Bad For You…How To Rock Being Pale This Winter,"<p>The end of summer means a lot of things. Shorter days, pea coats and knee high boots. As we gear up for winter and happily transition into knits and parkas, there is one aspect about the cold we do not welcome warmly: fading tans. With the briskness of winter upon us, girls everywhere silently begin to panic as they watch their tans fade, leaving behind milky paleness.</p>
<p>Many assuage this horrible transition with the use of tanning beds. It seems like the ideal maneuver until we began to see the long term effects on the women before us. Suddenly, tanning equates to smoking cigarettes: no matter how much cooler you look, it’s not worth the end result.</p>
<p>But there’s hope! Another angle you never considered before– Rocking the pale. It seems with the widespread hipster movement of American Apparel models and grunge, the natural look is back in. And people are taking advantage of it. Suddenly, it’s cool to be pale.</p>
<p>Pale has always been beautiful, if you have the right skin for it. Unortuantely, those with perfect complexions are a very rare. You’re lucky if you come out of puberty with only minor scars, and you don’t have to worry about make-up and natural remedies to increase that dewy look.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/natural-beauty-remedies/,Beauty,Ain’t No Beauty Like Natural Beauty,"<p>Beauty seems like it is something that changes with generations. And to some extent it does. But one thing that doesn’t change is the fact that beauty is a representation of your health. Being beautiful is a combination of health, confidence, happiness, and some style. Aspects like style and health are what change with the times. For instance, back in the old days a woman was considered more beautiful if she was more fat, because food was scarce, and women that had large fat stores were more likely to survive.</p>
<p>They were hence considered healthier. Now the situation has switched upside down (for the first world population at least). Food is in surplus and with many not able to control how much processed, chemical and sugar filled junk they eat, being overweight now comes with diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, hormone disruption, and the likes of that. Health in modern day is perceived as being lean (yet not unnaturally thin) and having muscle tone. Of course societal culture influences our perceptions too, but when it comes down to it, we are hard wired by a process called natural selection, to find health irresistibly sexy.</p>
<p>Girls everywhere for generations strive to find ways to make ourselves more beautiful. People invent products, they advertise them, try to convince you that you need them, and sometimes are very successful. But what we sometimes forget is that the best remedies are the ones nature has made us herself. Natural remedies often work better than any brand name product, because they make us healthier. Expensive does not always mean the best. So here are a few natural beauty tips that have worked wonderfully for many, and can for you too.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Coconut Oil:</span> I recently started using coconut oil as a moisturizer for the skin, and think it works better than any cream I’ve ever used. Supermodel Irina shayk said in an interview that she uses it as a moisturizer. Since its natural, no chemicals like parabens or alcohols will damage your skin or cause long term health risks. Not to mention it smells heavenly. You can use it for the face or body, but if you have oily or problematic facial skin, an oil-free moisturizer is better. It’s also very healthy to eat.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Honey:</span> Honey is filled with minerals that make your skin smooth and glowing if used as a face mask. It is also exfoliating (if you get cream honey). TV host Padma Lakshmi swears by honey as her skin-smoothing and anti-aging remedy. Her skin is quite inspiring! After cleansing, massage honey onto your skin and leave on for a few minutes. Afterwards rinse it off and moisturize. It’s great to do in the shower.</p>
<p><em><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><a href=""http://weheartit.com/entry/51472249?pgx=OpenMobileApp"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">We Heart it</span></a></span></em></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Sugar:</span> Sugar is one of the gentlest exfoliators out there. Mix sugar with your regular facial cleansing gel to make a good exfoliator. Massage over your face and rinse.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Olive Oil:</span> This is a very old beauty remedy used by the ancient Greeks and beyond. Weather ingested or applied topically, it is incredibly healthy for you, and is great for your skin and hair. Use olive oil as a moisturizing hair mask, something that Naomi Campbell is known for doing. Rub it into your hair and scalp before sleep and shampoo in the morning. You can mix other things like avocado and flax-seed oil into the mask to make it even more nutritious. It’s a bit uncomfortable to do this, but is good to do every now and then to give your hair a moisture boost. You can also rub a little olive oil into breakage-prone nails to help them grow stronger and healthier. You can remove eye-makeup with olive oil, and also mix it with sugar to make a moisturizing body-exfoliator. Don’t forget to add it to your salad too.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Argan Oil</span>: This is a precious and very difficult to make oil, however it is extremely good for your skin and hair. Instead of using a cream, supermodel Elsa Hosk uses argan oil as a facial moisturizer. It’s very gentle and gives you a glow. It’s perfect to pat over your skin in the dry wintertime climate. However for people with combination skin, this is not the best option. You can also apply some argan oil to the ends of your hair to moisturize and make it look healthier. I love using it to remove eye make-up.</p>
<p>And the final yet most important two beauty remedies: <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Sleep and Fitness</span>. These are the trickiest ones because they are the ones that require the most time, something that we often don’t have. I know it’s something I didn’t have while on my recent 1.5 month non-stop summer trip around Europe. However sleep is highly important, because it is during this time that the body restores and repairs itself. Skin gets rejuvenated, muscles get built, hormones are balanced, and growth happens. Fitness is important not only for the obvious reason of making you fit, but working out regularly also makes your skin clear and glowing, and makes your hair healthier. This is because it balances out the processes inside your body.</p>
<p>Why use chemical-infested products, that may have health damaging effects on your body, when you can often just use something natural? Our body was made by nature, and sometimes it reacts best to the things that nature made as well.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/spa-hacks-home-treatments-overworked-overtired-hustlers/,Beauty,"Spa Hacks: Treating Your Overtired, Overworked Self At Home And Saving Money","<p>Facials to eliminate blackheads or acne, scrubs to make skin glow, massages to relieve tense shoulders — all these spa treatments sound like nice ideas but not super practical for those who are tight on money.</p>
<p>Being in the early stages of careers, working overtime to make sure rent and bills get paid, and a variety of other circumstances means forgetting about pampering oneself for some time.&nbsp;So, for those who hustle, but don’t want to look beat-down by the bustle, here are a few spa hacks to refresh your mind and body.</p>
<p>You’ll be so glowing and refreshed that people will think you spent a week at a spa retreat, rather than chasing an 80-hour workweek with a weekend bender.</p>
<h2>Body Scrubs</h2>
<p>When winter rolls around, my skin starts to go full-cobra. I love a good snakeskin accessory, but not so much as a look for my legs. Whether your skin is prone to getting dry and flakey, or it’s just a bit dull, scrubs are a great way to remove that dead layer of skin and reveal new, healthy, glowing skin. Sugars exfoliate the skin, the oils help prevent your new skin from drying out, and extracts add that spa-like aromatherapy experience.</p>
<p>For the exfoliator, I use sugar. I like sugar scrubs, rather than salt scrubs, because it’s cheaper to experiment with different kinds of sugar; if you find you don’t love a sugar you tried in a scrub, you can just throw it into your coffee or next batch of cookies. I’ve found that I like the granularity and scratch of turbinado sugar.</p>
<p><a href=""http://http//www.guideglobal.com/nourish-your-skin-with-coconut-oil/"">Coconut oil</a> is my favorite because it hydrates, softens, AND won’t leave your skin feeling oily. It also has lots of other uses in at-home beauty treatments. That said, olive oil and almond oil also work very well. Just don’t use your vegetable oil – that will leave you feeling greasier than Paula Dean’s kitchen counters.</p>
<p>Coffee grounds can be added to any scrub. The caffeine in them is a natural skin tightener and antioxidant.</p>
<p>This is not an exact science; the ratios of ingredients in scrubs are guidelines, as are the quantities. You may find that you can double or halve recipes depending on how much surface area you have to cover.</p>
<p><b>Sugar &amp; Honey Scrub Recipe:</b></p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ½ cup sugar</p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ¼ cup honey</p>
<p><b>Vanilla-Almond Sugar Scrub</b></p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ½ cup sugar</p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ¼ cup coconut oil</p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 teaspoon vitamin E oil (optional)</p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 teaspoon almond extract</p>
<p><b>Pumpkin Pie Scrub</b></p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ½ cup brown sugar<b></b></p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ½ cup coconut oil<b></b></p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ¼ cup canned pumpkin (optional)<b></b></p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 teaspoon cinnamon<b></b></p>
<hr>
<h2>Facials</h2>
<p>Facials are a nice way to treat blackouts and breakouts, reduce puffiness and brighten skin. You should always begin these facials with a freshly washed, dry face. Apply the mixtures to the face and neck, and relax for about 15 to 20 minutes. To remove, rinse face with water, and gently pat (don’t scrub/wipe!) dry.</p>
<p>Either of the following can be used individually, but if you really want to go all out, begin with the facial scrub, then open pores by resting a washcloth dipped in warm water on your face for several minutes, and finally finish with the mask. Go ahead, treat yo’ self.</p>
<p><b>Oatmeal Face Mask</b></p>
<p>This is ideal for those with sensitive skin.</p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1/3 cup oats, finely ground</p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 tablespoons of plain yogurt, preferably whole-milk</p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 teaspoons honey</p>
<p><b>Vanilla Lavender Facial Scrub</b></p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ½ cup sugar</p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ¼ cup coconut oil</p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ½ teaspoon lavender extract</p>
<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ½ teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
<hr>
<h2>Massage – Body Rolling</h2>
<p>You’re going to think I sound insane, but all you need to get those knots out of your back and shoulders is a tennis ball. It’s the poor man’s massage.</p>
<p>Like any good knot-working massage, it’s not going to be the most pleasant experience of your life, but it will relax those tight areas. Firstly, place ball on the floor. Next, lay down on the ball. Then, roll the stress-wracked, knotted area back and forth over ball until the knot disappears. Boom.</p>
<p>If you want to get a little fancier with it, you should check out Yamuna Body Rolling. Some brilliant person took the tennis ball idea, elaborated upon it with different ball sizes of varying squishiness, and ta-da!</p>
<p>A whole new exercise cult was founded. I have actually tried one of these classes, and it’s great for knotty shoulders, tense backs, tight I.T. bands and anyone else who spends too much time hunched over a computer. <a href=""http://bit.ly/1dYs0wS"">This book</a> shows you the many places you can go with your tennis ball massage.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Are You Lazier And/Or Slightly Less Broke?</h2>
<p>There are many “premade” at-home spa treatments, which, though pricier than mixing your masks and scrubs, are still substantially more affordable than a day at the spa. The&nbsp;<a href=""http://bit.ly/HjwJeg"">Bliss Peppermint Body Scrub</a>&nbsp;is one of my all-time favorite scrubs because the peppermint leaves your skin feeling so fresh and tingly.</p>
<p>Sephora’s Body Scrubs, in&nbsp;<a href=""http://bit.ly/HjwBf1"">vanilla</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=""http://bit.ly/1ghiSUN"">coconut</a>, offer an equally enjoyable alternative at a lower price-point, as does C. Booth’s&nbsp;<a href=""http://bit.ly/HjwYGd"">Ginger Sugar Scrub</a>. For facials, there are a few kits that offer a lot of value for the price tag&nbsp;(i.e. multiple uses), like BIOELEMENTS&nbsp;<a href=""http://bit.ly/18194pL"">Deep Cleansing Kit</a>&nbsp;or Tarte’s&nbsp;<a href=""http://bit.ly/HjxeFi"">Clay Mask System</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Get The Ingredients</h2>
<p>For the above recipes, most of the ingredients can be found at organic grocery stores (if the store has a bulk section, it’s a great way to buy in smaller quantities), or specialty kitchen stores.</p>
<p>Though some individual ingredients seem a tad pricey, keep in mind that they provide many, many at-home treatments for a fraction of the cost of a single spa treatment. Or, if you get sick of DIY-ing your beauty routine before they’re used up, you can always just use them to bake a bunch of cookies. You can also find them online because, well, you can find everything online.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/ive-stopped-telling-bloated-feel-today/616966/,Beauty,Why I’ve Stopped Telling You How Bloated I Feel Today,"<p>Since age 12, I’ve been reading hundreds of articles on body image, eating issues and disorders, and ways to maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>I’ve also had my fair share of body issues. There were days when I would look in the mirror and think of ways to change everything about myself.</p>
<p>Over the fall, I gained enough weight to feel uncomfortable in my own skin. I felt pretty low about myself and during the spring semester, I decided it was finally time to do something about it.</p>
<p>My then-suitemate and I started going to the gym daily, working out really hard, talking about what we were eating and keeping ourselves — and each other —accountable for what we were putting into our bodies and knowing how to work it off. My workouts had me walking out of the gym sweaty, beaten and swollen, but nonetheless, proud.</p>
<p>As the weeks went on, I saw the difference in the mirror for the first time. My ironically named love handles started to shrink, my tummy started to flatten and I really felt like I had accomplished something.</p>
<p>I decided that I needed to work harder, since I was starting to notice the results and I wanted to continue to look and feel better.</p>
<p>I would never miss a day at the gym. I would workout harder and longer, and I would compare notes with my suitemate every night before going into my room, lifting up my shirt and wishing I had done more.</p>
<p>My life started to revolve around what I was eating, how much I was working out and talking to my suitemate about her progress. I stopped treating myself to chocolate on a bad day and instead ate almonds and dried mangos, trying to convince myself they were just as tasty.</p>
<p>If I didn’t go to the gym for a day or ate a cookie that I felt I shouldn’t have consumed, I would feel awful and guilty. My workouts became more intense and I felt a point of pride when I would come off of a machine achy and exhausted.</p>
<p>One day, a few weeks after the beginning of our decision to become healthier, my suitemate approached me mid-workout on the dreaded Stairmaster.</p>
<p>She looked at me and said, “I’m starting to get worried. I used to have a great body image, but since we started cracking down on ourselves, I can’t look in the mirror without picking out new flaws. I thought this would help me feel better about myself, not worse.”</p>
<p>She was right; I felt the same way. In the past weeks, I had started receiving compliments on my appearance and acknowledgements that I had clearly lost weight.</p>
<p>I felt more attractive, yes, but I also felt worse about my body. I would stare at myself in the mirror when I was changing, nitpicking at each thing that I could focus on and work on at the gym. The more I worked out, the worse I felt about my body.</p>
<p>Why? I was equating my sense of self-worth with how I felt about my body and how I felt I was being perceived. However, I never recognized what was happening.</p>
<p>Instead of being careful to not let myself focus on my weight and on my self-perception, I slipped into no longer being confident in my own skin.</p>
<p>I realized that the language my friends and I used to describe our bodies shifted away from the easily identifiable red flags for having a negative body image. Instead of saying that I felt fat, it was socially acceptable to say that I felt “bloated,” and instead of saying I wanted to go to the gym to lose weight, I said I wanted to get “toned.”</p>
<p>While the words themselves were supposed to be healthier, the meanings behind them weren’t. Some women drink juice rather than eat balanced meals and take pills to reduce the last bit of bloating before going out at night. Well, it’s not healthy just because it’s socially acceptable.</p>
<p>I had fallen into the “Mean Girls” trap when Cady didn’t know she was supposed to feel bad about how she looked until the other girls looked to her to contribute to their body-bashing sessions.</p>
<p>It’s easier to say that we feel bloated than fat because we shame each other for having a bad body images. But at the same time, those who do have a positive body image are pressured into finding problems that may not exist out of fear that someone else might find it for them.</p>
<p>I felt confident when people were complimenting me and telling me that I looked “better,” but that very affirmation left me feeling like there was something wrong with the way I looked before. Our sense of confidence is so intertwined with how we look because we can’t be confident without feeling good about our outer appearance.</p>
<p>Women, myself included, complain about how men objectify women and judge us for how we appear rather than who we truly are. But, men aren’t solely to blame.</p>
<p>We objectify each other and ourselves, which makes it seemingly universally acceptable to objectify the female body. If we don’t let our bodies dictate how we feel about ourselves, and we stop judging each other for how we look, it will send the signal that women are more than the mere bodies we occupy.</p>
<p>It is easy for us to tear ourselves down, but it’s not easy to recognize just how damaging it can be for ourselves and for other women.</p>
<p>It’s time that we stop shifting the language and start stopping the language. It’s easy to get wrapped up in our bodies because we are literally wrapped in them all of the time.</p>
<p>We must stop letting ourselves bash our figures and instead, find ways to celebrate them. If every girl identified something she liked about herself rather than something she wanted to change, we could start to change the way we perceive ourselves.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t sit around discussing our bodies, judging each other and ourselves. Our bodies are among the most private things we have. We must stop talking about them like they’re public entities for others to judge.</p>
<p>When you look in the mirror in your friend’s room before you go out, don’t say you look bloated. Say you look great, as does everyone in the room. It might not be the easiest thing to do, but it’s the first step to reclaiming our bodies from ourselves, for ourselves.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/way-put-on-eyeliner-affect-vision/983789/,Beauty,The Way You Put On Eyeliner Could Be Seriously Affecting Your Vision,"<p>You already know how difficult it is to perfectly line the outside of your eyes. So, imagine trying to put eyeliner on the inner rims of your eyes — a technique&nbsp;called tightlining.</p>
<p>It’s not fun, but some beauty gurus&nbsp;like the look so much, they can’t live without it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a three-person study from Canada’s&nbsp;University of Waterloo shows it’s probably <a href=""http://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/news/a38401/this-eyeliner-mistake-affects-vision/"" target=""_blank"">not a good idea</a> — in case you hadn’t guessed that already.</p>
<p>Researcher&nbsp;Alison Ng <a href=""http://journals.lww.com/claojournal/Abstract/publishahead/Migration_of_Cosmetic_Products_into_the_Tear_Film_.99602.aspx"" target=""_blank"">used video tracking</a> to compare the amount of Avon’s “Glimmerstick” eyeliner that migrated into the eye’s tear film (its top layer) when it was placed both inside and outside of the lash line.</p>
<p>When the liner was close to the eye, it showed up in the eye itself within five to 10 minutes of application.&nbsp;After two hours, thankfully, the specks had dissipated from the tear film of all participants’ eyes.</p>
<p>When eyes were tightlined, <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/27/us-eye-health-makeup-idUSKBN0MN1TT20150327"" target=""_blank"">15 to 30 percent</a> more liner specks moved into the eye than when makeup stayed <em>outside</em> the lash line. Can someone say,</p>
<blockquote><p>Ew?</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Ng, this is the first study to examine the way eyeliner moves into the eye itself. She’s hoping her results will be taken into consideration by those considering contact lenses and eye health. As you might imagine, having an eye full of pigmented particles is anything but natural.</p>
<p>Don’t feel bad if you could never master tightlining — turns out, it’s better that way.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151239/Stocksy_txp9938e3c8kyW000_Small_5830901-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/dangers-diy-skincare/839828/,Beauty,The Dangers of DIY Skincare: 6 Times You Should See The Doctor,"<p>No one enjoys visiting the doctor’s office, but especially the dermatologist where all those sharp objects and injectables look like something out of “Dexter.”</p>
<p>We will literally try anything to avoid going — and that’s where we run into trouble.&nbsp;It’s that pesky pimple you can’t stop picking at that eventually morphs into a crater.</p>
<p>Or those growing clusters of night creams eating more of your dresser space than your fleshy wrinkles. Sometimes we put too much faith in our own home remedies and end up making our skin problems worse.</p>
<p>Put down the homemade toothpaste concoction!</p>
<p>We spoke to two successful and notable dermatologists on which skin treatments are pure bogus, which are scary-dangerous and when it’s best to book a doctor’s appointment.</p>
<h2>1. Microneedling</h2>
<p>Microneedling is a newer therapy in which a special pen or roller-like device with a cluster of needles at the tip delivers miniscule needle pricks to stimulate collagen and the skin’s natural healing process.</p>
<p>Although it sounds painful, doctors and enthusiasts assert that microneedling can minimize wrinkles and greatly improve the appearance of scars. Microneedling kits are available to use in your home.</p>
<p>Dermatologists and skin technicians also offer more advanced microneedling treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor’s verdict:</strong> Don’t try this one at home. According to prominent Nashville, Tenn. dermatologist and EndyMed Medical consultant, Dr. Michael Gold, do-it-yourself microneedling is “potentially dangerous” and a “much bloodier” procedure. “Microneedling does make a difference in the office setting. You have to go to someone who knows what they are doing.”</p>
<p><strong>Dermo alternative:</strong> Dr. Gold suggests visiting a licensed dermatologist if you’re interested in microneedling to avoid scarring or dermatitis after penetrating the skin.</p>
<p>EndyMed, in particular, is a radiofrequency device used in-office that, along with a host of other functions like body contouring and hyperpigmentation treatment, is particularly efficient at skin rejuvenation and healing acne scars even faster.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Because of the radiofrequency there is no bleeding post-op. The downside is remarkably little. Patient responses are really, really good,” explains Dr. Gold.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>2. Lasers</h2>
<p>Companies have recently begun manufacturing lasers and light sources for at-home usage.</p>
<p>These powerful beams are advertised for hair removal, facial rejuvenation and improving the appearance of sun damage and fine lines.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor’s verdict:</strong> Be wary of these strong promises. Dr. Gold cautions to be careful when purchasing these products, “Anything you can do at home is a maintainence of what the doctor should be doing in his office.</p>
<p>And anything you use at home should be an FDA-cleared device. Especially for the skin on your face.” Just remember, anything that’s too good to be true is too good to be true.</p>
<p><strong>Dermo alternative:</strong> “I can do a lot of magical things with needles and lasers and so forth,” adds Dr. Gold, “but you can’t do that at home.&nbsp;We can give you adjunct skincare.”</p>
<p>If you’re considering removing that mustache for good, you might want to check in with the doctor first before you go burning your face off.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Acne Treatment</h2>
<p>There are hundreds of acne treatments available without a prescription — chief among them being your own fingers.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we’ll even get real crazy and apply body creams to our face or vice versa. There have been some fatal instances involving toothpaste. Literally we’ll try anything to get rid of a big, blotchy blemish.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor’s verdict:</strong> Follow directions and don’t get out of hand. “It’s best not to pop pimples at home because they can lead to deep acne cysts or scars. I’ve even seen infections,” advises New York City Dermatologist Dr. Debra Jaliman.</p>
<p>“Acne medicines meant for the face are much milder than acne medicines meant for the body.” Meaning, don’t play doctor if you aren’t one.</p>
<p><strong>Derma alternative:</strong> If you want to avoid a visit to the dermatologist, Dr. Jaliman recommends <a href=""http://www.cleanandclear.com/acne-treatments/advantage-acne-spot-treatment"" target=""_blank"">Clean &amp; Clear ADVANTAGE® Acne Spot Treatment</a>. Otherwise, you can make an appointment to have your face-crater treated and injected, which will heal the pimple much faster than topical creams.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Microdermabrasions</h2>
<p>Microdermabrasion is a non-invasive cosmetic procedure that exfoliates the outer layers of the skin. “They are good for getting rid of bumps, uneven color and improving the texture of the skin,” says Dr. Jaliman.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor’s verdict:</strong> You’re good to go.</p>
<p>“Microdermabrasions at home are not as strong as the ones done in a doctors office,” clarifies Dr. Jaliman. “I strongly recommend them to my patients as they can be done weekly at home. In a doctor’s office we do them every two to four weeks.”</p>
<p><strong>Dermo alternative:</strong> There are various treatments on the market that promise to improve your skin’s texture.</p>
<p>If you’re nervous about doing it yourself (our shaky hands combined with our inexperience doesn’t bode well), you can visit the dermatologist to perform a more specialized procedure. “I also use an in-office Microdermabrasion, which is very effective and light facial peels, which have no downtime,” suggests Dr. Jaliman.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. Crow’s feet creams</h2>
<p>We’ve all been bombarded in the department stores and overwhelmed at the drugstore enough to know that wrinkle creams are the holy grail of home-beauty and, according to my shar pei, “seriously changes your life.”</p>
<p>Tons of lotions claim they can erase these fine lines and signs of aging.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor’s verdict:</strong> It’s temporary. Dr. Gold warns, “Beware of things — you can’t make crow’s feet go away with lotions and creams. You can reduce the appearance because [these lotions] swell and moisturize the skin.” You can’t make crow’s feet totally disappear with creams. Put on a happy face.</p>
<p><strong>Dermo alternative:</strong> There are very potent cosmeceuticals and products containing retinol that improve texture, color and fine lines. Dr. Jaliman recommends <a href=""http://www.rocskincare.com/retinol-correxion/deep-wrinkle-night-cream"" target=""_blank"">RoC Retinol Correxion® Deep Wrinkle Night Cream</a>. “Otherwise, I would look to do most procedures in a doctors office like Botox, lasers and filler,” she adds. Slurp, slurp.</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. Cellulite</h2>
<p>Dr. Gold sums up our struggle with lady lumps accurately, “Cellulite is one of the holy grails.”</p>
<p>Indeed, if you are fortunate enough to inherit sucker-puncher thighs, it is very hard to totally erase it.</p>
<p>This is also why skin tightening is one of the biggest emerging markets in dermatology. We want our legs to look freakin’ awesome when we exit a taxi, basically.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor’s verdict:</strong> It’s a quick fix. Cellulite creams, says Dr. Gold, “Don’t do much, they just make it look better for a while.” If you do purchase a cellulite lotion, make sure it includes caffeine and niacinamide, which temporarily reduce the appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Dermo alternative:</strong> Go somewhere reputable with safe devices, which will be much more effective than rubbing on creams.</p>
<p>Some companies are even researching injectables. Or, go see Dr. Gold, who’s in-office procedure using EndyMed or Velashape are great at skin tightening.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151233/Stocksy_txp4172e78bJqW000_Small_677363-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/going-cruelty-free-makeup-changed-my-life/942339/,Beauty,How Going Cruelty-Free Changes The Way You See Beauty And Cosmetics,"<p>In stores filled with perfectly organized rows of prepackaged cosmetic goodies, the quiet labs where animal testing takes place can seem far removed — so far, typically, you forget how closely&nbsp;they’re linked.</p>
<p>But, for the thousands of beagles, guinea pigs and rabbits injured each year, life is a slow, caged slog toward death — all of it, just&nbsp;to perfect this season’s “it” shade of pink.</p>
<p>Focusing on the animals is how I&nbsp;found myself wandering aimlessly through a maze of fluorescent aisles in search of products promising more <em>good</em> than harm.</p>
<p>Fawning over animals is practically a hobby of mine; I regularly ask my pet cat whether or not she’s feeling okay (she mostly ignores me), and I volunteer to walk shelter dogs. There’s a soft spot in my heart for all things furry and feathered.</p>
<p>So, like a bewildered, modern-day “Alice in Wonderland,” I finally turned a corner to find a whole row of cartoon rabbits staring down at me.</p>
<p>The parallels between the movie and my life hit too close to home — Alice was frantically searching for&nbsp;a mythical creature, but I was&nbsp;chasing a real one.</p>
<p>The leaping bunny is&nbsp;the stamp of approval created by the Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics (CCIC). It’s given to cosmetic brands when they don’t&nbsp;employ animal testing while developing cosmetic products.</p>
<p>Since its creation in 1996, the&nbsp;bunny has become a symbol of the cruelty-free movement.</p>
<p>Because I place such high value on living, acting and eating compassionately, buying any drugstore mascara from my local CVS felt hypocritical.</p>
<p>Although the term “cruelty-free”&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/Claims/ucm2005202.htm"" target=""_blank"">doesn’t have</a> a legal definition, it normally includes products which&nbsp;<em>haven’t</em> been tested on laboratory animals and are often vegan.</p>
<p>My first purchases were cautious: a body lotion here, a lip balm there. But, with experience came&nbsp;confidence, and soon, I could navigate the crowded shelves of a New York City Whole Foods like a professional.</p>
<p>My skin improved. I began to enjoy my beauty routine each morning. I actually <em>saved</em> money. In the short-term timeframe that’d passed, I had tangible, feel-good results.</p>
<p>By making the choice to go cruelty-free, I’d accidentally adopted an entirely new approach to beauty, one that allows&nbsp;my&nbsp;life on the outside to&nbsp;match with the one on the inside.</p>
<h2>You don’t have to compromise who you are and what you believe in.</h2>
<p>First thing in the&nbsp;morning, I reach&nbsp;for a bar of cruelty-free soap and facial lotion. In those two&nbsp;simple steps, I’ve already set the tone for my day.</p>
<p>Choosing products that don’t harm animals is a conscious decision. Just like “waking up on the right side of the bed,” I’m deciding to live in a kinder way to animals.</p>
<p>I like to believe attitude extends outside the boundaries of makeup and into my relationships. “Living without harm” is a sort of mantra I&nbsp;reinforce each time I apply mascara or shampoo my hair.</p>
<p>My attitude is echoed by sisters Tish and Snooky Bellomo, who founded the iconic hair dye brand, <a href=""http://manicpanic.com/"" target=""_blank"">Manic Panic</a>, way back in 1977.&nbsp;In an email, the Manic Panic&nbsp;representatives&nbsp;described these&nbsp;feelings of having a clear conscience as “guilt-free glamour,” adding,</p>
<blockquote><p>Making the right decision is always worth it in the end. Going vegan and cruelty-free is the way of the future, and even more simply, it’s the moral path.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>You don’t just buy&nbsp;products; you invest in&nbsp;values, too.</h2>
<p>Before transitioning to cruelty-free makeup, I often felt like I was being forced into a mold created by cosmetic companies.</p>
<p>I’d never worried about cellulite, for example, but, somehow, every lotion I saw on shelves boasted “cellulite-masking powers.” Language like that, alone, made me feel like I needed it.</p>
<p>The feeling of being a marketing pawn rather than a valued individual vanished when I began to find cruelty-free brands to replace my usual buys.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;company founded in positivity is, in my experience, more likely to consider&nbsp;its customers’ needs than to&nbsp;simply try to sell them the same old cherry red lipstick.</p>
<p>Model Josie Maran, founder of the <a href=""http://www.josiemarancosmetics.com/"" target=""_blank"">eponymous cosmetics line</a>, believes a value-driven company creates a special bond with&nbsp;consumers.&nbsp;She says,</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a sense of community within our company [Josie Maran Cosmetics]…It’s an understanding that we’re all empowered to make a real difference and have fun while we’re doing it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maran speaks to the idea of a shared mission: creating beauty without sacrificing ethics. Cruelty-free cosmetics companies are on your side.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Buying cruelty-free is much more satisfying.</h2>
<p>Swapping out my makeup, bath products and lotions was a daunting task because I’ve been known to hoard cosmetics.</p>
<p>But, as one mascara emptied and was replaced by a cruelty-free version, the list of ingredients on the bottle seemed increasingly attractive&nbsp;to me.</p>
<p>Taking an active role in your own product consumption&nbsp;is a process Sarah Galusha, personal care category manager at Hain Celestial Care, describes as&nbsp;uplifting.</p>
<p>Galusha, who represents <a href=""http://www.albabotanica.com/"" target=""_blank"">Alba Botanica</a>, believes checking ingredients makes you more satisfied as a customer handing over a credit card.&nbsp;She explains,</p>
<blockquote><p>You’ll know you’re not exposing yourself to a long list of potentially harmful chemicals commonly found in many conventional [products] and you’ll know that no animal was harmed to create the product.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reading scientific studies dedicated to parabens, sulfates, aluminum and other cosmetic add-ins suddenly became somewhat of a dirty hobby, increasing both my curiosity and awareness.</p>
<p>I think of it as a kind of butterfly effect: Transitioning&nbsp;your cosmetics to “ethical” buys makes you wonder what else you’ve been overlooking when it comes to consumption, health and safety.</p>
<hr>
<h2>It’s always quality over quantity.</h2>
<h2></h2>
<p>Although it often seems cruelty-free or “natural” items are more expensive than their big-beauty counterparts, beauty brand representatives across the board label the&nbsp;idea a myth.</p>
<p>In fact, actively considering the animals and people involved in the creation&nbsp;of&nbsp;your beauty products can&nbsp;make you <em>less</em> likely to break your budget.</p>
<p>With a little research, you’re more likely to choose a few quality products rather than a whole stash of mediocre lip glosses that fade&nbsp;after one hour.</p>
<p>Maran agrees with the “less is more” point of view, adding,</p>
<blockquote><p>For me, the real question is at what cost are we willing to forego using cruelty-free products?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The products we’re innovating at Josie Maran are made with love, compassion and really good stuff so you can get amazing results and use less product, which it’s means money well spent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Originally, I’d expected the world of cruelty-free beauty to mean endless trips to Sephora to burn through my latest paycheck, but it wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>I strategized at home first, catalogued the products I needed, and found homemade recipes for those I didn’t want to buy. Face masks with ingredients found in every kitchen have become my new kind of cooking.</p>
<hr>
<h2>You give back to your cause with every purchase you make.</h2>
<p>It’s difficult and time-consuming to make a major life change — like restocking your entire medicine cabinet — but purchasing products from companies with value systems similar to yours enables you&nbsp;to stick to your beliefs.</p>
<p>In other words, I put my money where my mouth (and heart) is.</p>
<p>Besides the fact cruelty-free companies prevent harm to innocent animals, many even donate money to charitable causes.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.burtsbees.com/"" target=""_blank"">Burt’s Bees</a> Vice President of Research and Development Celeste Lutrario recommends actively seeking out brands who&nbsp;send a portion of their earnings to charity.</p>
<p>She’s practically an expert on the subject because a portion of Burt’s Bees’ revenue goes back to <a href=""http://www.burtsbees.com/Outreach/sustain-community,default,pg.html"" target=""_blank"">benefit the honeybees</a>&nbsp;on which they depend.</p>
<p>Although making the move to cruelty-free beauty was challenging at first, I’m secure in the fact my beauty purchases and values are finally in sync. The harmony is beautiful.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/stilas-new-glow-in-the-dark-lip-crayon/,Beauty,Stila’s New Glow In The Dark Lip Crayon,"<p>When it comes to a themed event, such as a black light party, an edm festival, etc, girls go all out in preparation. Take the ever so popular edm festivals for example: girls will deck themselves out in festival appropriate attire and max out on the neon just because, well, it’s fun.</p>
<p>This new beauty product is bound to increase your themed neon ensembles even more and I have to admit, it’s pretty cool — in an I’m-a-90s-girl-having-trouble-letting-go-of-kitschy-makeup way.</p>
<p>Stila has just launched a new high-octane lip product called After Glow Lip Color. The product is simple enough, a chunky lip pencil in six vibrant shades perfect for any summer time look. The lip pencils are apart of Stila’s new throwback summer collection (again, perfect for us 90s girls) and are, according to Stila, three times brighter than conventional lip colors.</p>
<p>What’s especially noticeable about this product is that at night, they’re designed to glow under UV light. The UV lighting effect will only work in certain settings, such as a nightclub. Stila also recommends making sure that your lips are super moisturized and exfoliated prior to application, as the bright, matte look will increase visibility of every crease and crack on your lips.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the nighttime UV glow effect, these lip pencils are actually pretty practical. They’re extremely moisturizing (featuring ingredients such as algae extract, glycerin, sunflower seed oil, and vitamins C and E), smell amazing and have a smooth consistency that glides on easily, allowing you to build coverage and color.</p>
<p>Options for these lip pencils include: Electric Pink, Vivid Violet, Tangerine Dream, Party Pink, Festive Fuchsia and Rave Red. Purchase this perfect summer beauty product anywhere where Stila Products are sold for $18.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/the-cult-obsession-with-hair-and-why-its-one-of-our-most-defining-features/,Beauty,The Cult Obsession With Hair And Why It’s One Of Our Most Defining Features,"<p>Jared Leto might have taken home a shiny Oscar for his outstanding performance in “Dallas Buyers Club,” but the real winner of the night was his hair. On a red carpet of predictable updos and ordinary waves, Leto’s locks stood out for their luster, texture and impeccable <em>hommbré</em> execution.</p>
<p>His hair was more talked about, more enviable and more splash-worthy than any of the dramatic gowns or dazzling jewels that appeared on the red carpet, and for good reason: We have a cult obsession with hair.</p>
<p>When J.Law cut hers, the world responded in an uproar, which then prompted her director to issue an apology assuming responsibility for her shorter ‘do. Post-pregnancy, Kim Kardashian dyed her infamous jet black mane to a softer caramel blonde. It boosted her image and positively put her back in the spotlight.&nbsp;And you can’t even utter Jennifer Aniston’s name without mentally associating her with “The Rachel” ubiquitous haircut. This is all because our coifs are very closely tied to our self-image and sense of self.</p>
<p>Take a moment to visualize yourself in your mind. You probably pictured salient features like your head, your legs, maybe your eyes or stature — and definitely your most identifying component: your hair.</p>
<p>Much like body fat composition or blemished skin, our hair is one of the first bodily traits we notice in the mirror. It has a real, tangible prominence in our lives. We associate our personalities with our look, let it impact our mood, and even form an emotional attachment to our strands. Experiencing a bad style is not unlike the entire island of Manhattan breaking out into anarchy and collapsing on itself.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to sound shallow — clearly there is more to a person than what’s on top of his or her head — but it’s hard to deny hair’s strong significance in our daily lives. It very much influences both our demeanors and how others perceive us. On the surface, a straight-haired girl and a curly-haired girl are internalized differently: One is seen as polished while the other is relaxed, respectively.</p>
<p>Which is also the reason we intentionally plan out our hairstyles in advance of an event — our hair is a reflection of ourselves. A professional job interview calls for sleek and clean. Tousled and easy is fitting for a pool party. An elegant updo enhances a strapless evening gown. Especially in the modeling industry, cutting or coloring a model’s hair can literally make or break him or her.</p>
<p>As someone who can groom hers in a variety of ways, I know that I assume varying personas corresponding with my hair’s texture that day. When it’s a giant frizzball, as it’s accustomed to, I’m less confident and more inclined to stick it under a hoodie. Conversely, after a fresh blow out, I love parading around the city and socializing.</p>
<p>And I fully believe that men are more attracted to my smoothed-out locks than the crazy tendrils (although my girlfriends insist the opposite). Blow dry bars are so successful because people like me carry ourselves better when we’re feeling positive about our ‘dos. It just puts the extra pep in your step.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever been one of those people who envies the perfectly coiled and immaculately glossy strands on girl walking down the street and thinks, “I wish I had her hair,” then you totally get what I’m talking about. We praise hair goddesses with unearthly compliments, such as “you’re so lucky” and “you have the best hair,” and then run home to try and emulate it on our own. Hair envy is completely a real thing.</p>
<p>And in some extreme cases, our locks really do define who we are. Mia Farrow’s famous baby doll cut was synonymous with her innocent demeanor. Twiggy cut off all her hair and pioneered the androgynous look. Kyle Richards, Blake Lively, Carrie Bradshaw, Kelly Osbourne, P!nk, Miley Cyrus — they all would have nothing without their notorious manes.</p>
<p>It’s the equivalent of being known for a killer body or admiring someone’s voluptuous bra-filling capabilities. It adds sex appeal, movement and character. We remove it practically everywhere else on our bodies except our heads because it contributes to our uniqueness.</p>
<p>Blondes claim they “look like a different person” during summer months when the sun subtly lightens their golden tones. Redheads like Julianne Moore have a hard time being inconspicuous due to their naturally radiant color. Mousy brunettes complain of looking too ordinary. Hair woes have a viable impact on our daily functioning and the struggle is real.</p>
<p>Naysayers might say I’ve taken it too far. That I’ve got problems for letting my hair affect me so greatly — and they would, in some respects, be correct. I’ve always wanted to be one of those girls who could step out of the shower and not think twice about how her hair dries afterwards. To be able to just wake up, give it a quick brush and go.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, though, it’s important to remember that it’s not <em>on</em>, but rather, what’s <em>inside</em> your head that truly counts.</p>
<p><a href=""http://wildfox.tumblr.com/"" target=""_blank""><em>Photo via Wild Fox Tumblr</em></a></p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04150851/Stocksy_txp01a83d7ebyW000_Small_295780-800x399.jpg

<p>Photographer Isis Charise has shot a number of breast cancer survivors in the nude so that the women can show their beauty with their mastectomy scars.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It is my hope that these images create a doorway that leads to further acceptance of the post mastectomy body. Not only for women who live with the challenge of breast cancer, but also for their partners, families and caregivers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In the photo series, <a href=""http://www.the-grace-project.org/"" target=""_blank"">entitled Grace</a>, the women are posed romantically in goddess-inspired sets, emulating the likes of Venus and Aphrodite.</p>
<p>Charise said the decision to pose her models as Greek goddesses and other mythical figures highlights the women’s natural beauty.</p>
<blockquote><p><span id=""ext-gen134"">“I considered that if I photographed my subjects within this classical context in mind, that it would create a window for both the subject and the viewer to access a place of acceptance and beauty.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Although the photos might be NSFW, they’re still a poignant reminder of the beauty that exists in a body even after it’s been damaged by illness.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/best-products-use-hair-humid-heat/1032875/,Beauty,The Frizzy-Haired Girl’s No-Fail Guide To Looking Fabulous In Humidity,"<p>There’s nothing like stepping out of the shower to face another humid summer day, only to find your damp strands&nbsp;have suddenly become a frizzy halo.</p>
<p>You aimed for Britney circa 2000, but you&nbsp;ended up with&nbsp;Justin Timberlake’s “ramen noodle” hair.</p>
<p>Humidity happens to the best of us, and try as you may to&nbsp;mat down those&nbsp;freewheeling hairs,&nbsp;it’s usually all for nought.</p>
<p>It’s not that&nbsp;there aren’t products designed for us; it’s just a few greasy experiences in the past make it difficult to believe anything works as&nbsp;advertised.</p>
<p>If there’s any lesson to be taken from superhero movies, it’s this: You can’t fight an enemy until you know exactly what you’re dealing with.</p>
<p>To help you understand and tame frizz, we contacted two of the best in the business: Nicholas Vickers, the “Mane Maestro” of New York’s <a href=""http://foxandjanesalon.com/"" target=""_blank"">Fox and Jane Salon</a>, and Eric Spengler, <a href=""http://www.livingproof.com/"" target=""_blank"">Living Proof</a>’s senior vice president of research and development.</p>
<p>Armed with the right tools and expert knowledge, your humid-hair worries will evaporate into thin air.</p>
<h2>Frizz starts inside your strands.</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the basics: When the weather is humid, air contains exponentially <em>more</em> moisture than on a dry day.</p>
<p>You’d think that was good for your mane, right? Wrong. Some&nbsp;of the&nbsp;extra dampness&nbsp;absorbs into your&nbsp;hair, which Spengler says can up the weight of your mane by as much as&nbsp;30 percent.</p>
<p>When hair takes in dampness, its exterior cuticle expands.</p>
<p>The result is jagged outer edges rubbing against each other&nbsp;and bending all sorts of ways, causing friction and impossibly frizzy flyaways that just won’t stay put.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Thirsty hair will be the first to run wild.</h2>
<p>It’ll be no surprise to most curly-haired girls, but Vickers says they’re most likely to feel the effects of a humid day.</p>
<p>Dry or damaged hair needs moisture, which is <em>exactly</em> what the weather is providing. (And you thought Mother Nature was doing you a favor.)</p>
<p>Keeping hair healthy is the easiest way to improve its state on humid days.</p>
<p>So it’s not a good idea to turn on the blow dryer every single day (not like&nbsp;you’d want to in the summer heat). High temperatures will <em>temporarily</em> smooth cuticles and tame the frizz, but they’re causing more damage than good in the long term.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Calm frizz with light oils and creams.</h2>
<p>Frizz can seem daunting, but both Vickers and Spengler assured us it’s more of a fair&nbsp;fight if&nbsp;you have the right tools.</p>
<p>When choosing products for humid days, pick light, creamy substances created&nbsp;to smooth your hair’s outer cuticles without going limp.</p>
<p>What should you look for? Start by <em>really</em><em>&nbsp;</em>reading&nbsp;the ingredients. The pros recommend avoiding products with drying agents like sulfates and alcohols.</p>
<p>Vickers stands by R+Co’s <a href=""http://www.randco.com/tinsel-smoothing-oil.html"" target=""_blank"">TINSEL Smoothing Oil</a>&nbsp;for thick hair, while recommending&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.randco.com/foil-frizz-static-control-spray.html"" target=""_blank"">FOIL Frizz + Static Control Spray</a>&nbsp;for women with fine strands. To seal in the moisture, lightly coat your locks with&nbsp;hairspray.</p>
<p>Living Proof patented its own <a href=""http://www.livingproof.com/about/science"" target=""_blank"">frizz-frighting ingredient</a>: OFPMA, a “brilliantly bulletproof molecule” that smooths and protects strands from humidity as well as healing damage.</p>
<p>Spengler recommends his brand’s&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.livingproof.com/buy/no-frizz-nourishing-styling-cream"" target=""_blank"">No Frizz&nbsp;Nourishing Styling Cream</a>&nbsp;for curls and, for the lightweights, <a href=""http://www.livingproof.com/buy/no-frizz-weightless-styling-spray"" target=""_blank"">Weightless Styling Spray</a>.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04150851/Stocksy_txp01a83d7ebyW000_Small_295780-800x399.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/pixie-perfect-rocking-short-hair-says-woman/952799/,Beauty,Pixie Perfect: What Rocking Short Hair Says About A Woman,"<p>Women all over Hollywood have recently discovered a new way to reclaim their femininity.</p>
<p>This movement is allowing women to shift away from catering to&nbsp;man’s perception of “sexy,” and giving them&nbsp;space to define it in their own terms.</p>
<p>Okay, relax,&nbsp;I am not talking about reading Simone de Beauvoir or burning all of your bras.</p>
<p>In fact, all that’s needed for this transformation is a pair of scissors&nbsp;and&nbsp;a Yelp-approved hairstylist.</p>
<p>This new fad of short hair has started to replace the previously sought-after long, luscious locks.</p>
<p>Women are making the decision to cut their hair for themselves, rather than for men who fantasize about the women with long, voluminous hair, posing seductively in Playboy.</p>
<p>Instead, women with short hair now radiate a new form of sexiness through their confidence that refuses to go unnoticed, rather than through pure “look at my tits” sex appeal.</p>
<p>Some of the most prominent, young, female celebrities and models have made this transformation, including the beautiful Taylor Swift, Margot Robbie and Rosie Huntington, proving these women no longer feel pressured to wear their hair in a way that stereotypically appeals to men.</p>
<p>Even so, I think we can all agree they remain effortlessly gorgeous.</p>
<p>I recently hopped on the short hair bandwagon after having hair that touched my belly button my entire life.</p>
<p>Let me preface this by saying I got my cut <em>the day</em> <em>before</em> Kim Kardashian did, so technically, America’s most coveted sex symbols copied little old me!</p>
<p>As silly as this might sound, cutting my hair has given me a new sense of self and independence because I made this appearance-altering decision without asking a man’s opinion, or even caring what the guys in my life might think.</p>
<p>Over the years of having long hair, I trained myself to eventually perfect the Victoria’s Secret bombshell waves with my blow dryer and curling wand.</p>
<p>I put so much time and effort into making my hair look good, I didn’t realize I had been hiding behind it.</p>
<p>Cutting my hair to my shoulders forced me to be comfortable with my features, and to my disbelief, it didn’t send guys running to the hills.</p>
<p>Perhaps, this new version of sexy might be onto something.</p>
<p>By breaking the age-old stereotype that “women are supposed to have long hair and men are supposed to have short hair,” we’ve shattered some socially constructed gender binaries.</p>
<p>A short hair cut provides a woman with the composure to strut into an office building and command the attention of men who may have previously underestimated or even sexualized her.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the gender hair spectrum, the number of man buns has&nbsp;skyrocketed to the point that the @ManBunMonday Instagram account has 140,000 followers. (I mean, they’re hot as f*ck, so no surprises there.)</p>
<p>This style may be seen to some guys as “girly” or “feminine,” but the men rocking these insanely sexy buns are just confident and comfortable with&nbsp;their sexuality.</p>
<p>As much as I’d like to claim I never had doubts about my decision or regretted losing my long locks, I can’t.</p>
<p>When I look back at old pictures and see the beautiful blonde waves I used to rock, it’s hard not to wonder if I made the right decision.</p>
<p>But, the minute I try on an outfit that automatically becomes exponentially edgier, I remember why I did it.</p>
<p>Breaking away from gender norms obviously cannot be done entirely by cutting off some hair, or in a man’s case, growing it out.</p>
<p>However, a short haircut shows a woman is tired of being seen as a sex object, or as immature and unprofessional in a work setting.</p>
<p>Short hair on a woman demands respect in a way long hair does not.&nbsp;And, hey, you save a ton on shampoo!</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04150858/Stocksy_txp4df5dd8ajhW000_Small_390174-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/beer-hair-treatment/1025072/,Beauty,"I Poured Beer On My Hair In The Name Of Beauty, And I’m So Glad I Did","<p>I’ve never been much of a DIYer.</p>
<p>Though I love the idea of creating my own all-natural cosmetics and beauty products, the fact of the matter is, I’m lazy.</p>
<p>I find it much easier to spend my money on overpriced products than to sit in my kitchen whipping up some weird concoction that may or may not leave me covered in a pimple-like rash.</p>
<p>But, here’s the thing: I’m also, like most adults my age, f*cking poor. Spending $50 on a deep conditioning mask, though&nbsp;worth it, is not in my best interest (and my landlord would agree).</p>
<p>Recently, there’s been a lot of talk in the beauty world about the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3007956/Suki-Waterhouse-reveals-washes-hair-Coca-Cola-achieve-perfectly-tousled-look.html"">supposed benefits</a>&nbsp;of pouring Coca-Cola in your hair.</p>
<p>While I’m never going to succumb to this&nbsp;— something about soda in my hair makes me think about my clumsy middle school days in the worst way — there is another DIY hair treatment I’ve always been sort of intrigued&nbsp;by:&nbsp;the beer rinse.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href=""http://magazine.foxnews.com/style-beauty/beer-beautiful-hair-does-it-work"">beauty folklore</a>, beer makes an amazing strengthening and shine treatment. It’s believed the proteins in the beer can fill in and smooth cracked,&nbsp;damaged&nbsp;cuticles&nbsp;while the natural sugars and B vitamins add shine.</p>
<p>While I can’t help but think pouring beer over my head seems like a waste of perfectly good beer, the potential payoff is too appealing not to try.</p>
<p>So last night, in the sake of beauty and financial security, I finally decided to give the beer rinse&nbsp;a go.</p>
<h2>What the hell am I doing?</h2>
<p>First, I had to do some research. Was there a certain type of beer I should use? Was I supposed to wash my hair first or just dump it in? Would I smell like a bad decision until my next shower?</p>
<p>My questions were all kindly laid out for me in a detailed <a href=""http://health.howstuffworks.com/skin-care/hair-care/scalp-treatments/beer-good-hair.htm"">How Stuff Works article</a>. First: Any beer will do.</p>
<p>Since it’s the sugar and proteins doing the work, I figured a full-bodied beer would be best — nothing watered down, thus, nothing “lite.”</p>
<p>The instructions indicated I should dilute the beer with a small amount of apple cider vinegar and water to reduce the frat-house smell, but I decided against doing so, wanting instead to harness the full effects of the bubbly stuff (even if it did smell strongly of a bar floor).</p>
<p>As to the process: I’d wash my hair first, as usual. After rinsing out the shampoo, I’d just pour my brew of choice onto my wet head and let it do its magic for the rest of my shower, approximately 20 minutes. Then, I’d rinse it out, condition if desired, et voilà: hair perfection.</p>
<p>I alerted my <del>live-in butler</del>&nbsp;boyfriend to the impending experiment&nbsp;and requested he buy me some beer — one for my head and one to drink.</p>
<p>He presented me with two bottles: Coors Light and one Pacifico, my favorite. Since I’d decided against using light beer, I was resigned to drinking the Coors and using the Pacifico for my treatment.</p>
<p>After taking a few “before” pictures of my parched strands, I hopped in the shower&nbsp;and lathered up with my go-to Redken shampoo. I was ready to take the plunge.</p>
<hr>
<h2>It was the first time I’d ever wished for a warm beer.</h2>
<p>Though I’d read it’s best to warm the beer to room temperature prior to dumping it all over my head (and, as I’d soon learn, body), my laziness won out, and I skipped the warming session.</p>
<p>I didn’t think it’d make much of a difference. The bottle wasn’t chilled — it was just slightly cool to the touch.</p>
<p>After I opened the bottle and released the fizzy contents on my head, I realized why the directions recommended warming the beer first.</p>
<p>There is nothing like pouring cold liquid on your head and body to make you regret every single decision you’ve ever made.</p>
<p>As I stood there, shivering, with cold beer dripping down my back, I momentarily considered giving up and sticking my head back under the increasingly inviting stream of hot water. But beauty prevailed.</p>
<p>Because hair tends to drip when it’s wet, I gathered my strands into a top knot in an attempt to keep the beer in my hair while I continued my shower.</p>
<p>It seemed to work, and although some of the brew definitely escaped my tresses, a good amount managed to stay put. Success.</p>
<p>After 15&nbsp;minutes or so, I undid the bun and rinsed out my newly-treated locks. To my dismay, my hair did not feel, as I’d hoped, perfectly smooth and silk-like but rather slightly rougher than usual.</p>
<p>It almost felt gritty, similar to the way hair feels straight after a dip in the ocean or after using a texturizer.</p>
<p>I hoped I didn’t f*ck anything up and again wished I just drank the beer instead of, literally, pouring it down the drain.</p>
<p>Because my “before” picture was on day-old, air-dried hair, I decided to try and recreate the same circumstances before examining my newly treated hair to ensure an even playing field.</p>
<p>So I combed it, braided it and went to sleep as normal.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Drunk in love</h2>
<p>I woke up this morning half-excited and half-terrified. As I studied my still-braided strands, I noticed no damage (but also no miracles).</p>
<p>But as I unwound the braids, feeling defeated by my experiment, I noticed something: My hair felt a lot softer than it normally does — and&nbsp;it felt lighter.</p>
<p>Combing my fingers through my hair confirmed: It was definitely softer.</p>
<p>Later, at work, a coworker commented my hair looked “really shiny,” another success.</p>
<p>Though throughout the course of the day, my natural frizziness kicked in and killed my dreams of newly smoothed hair, my strands did remain noticeably softer and shinier than usual, even if it wasn’t&nbsp;by epic proportions.</p>
<p>One of my biggest fears prior to the treatment was the beer would leave me smelling like an alcoholic’s wet dream, but fortunately, that was not the case.</p>
<p>In fact, I couldn’t smell it at all, even when I ungracefully stuck my hair up against my nose.</p>
<p>By all accounts, the beer rinse was a success.</p>
<p>As to whether I’ll ever try it again, perhaps.</p>
<p>Part of me (OK, all of me) still prefers the luxe conditioners and oils I can’t afford and shouldn’t buy.</p>
<p>And, in the spirit of full disclosure, I’m much more likely to just complain about the state of my hair than I am to actually gather up the energy to actually do something about it.</p>
<p>That said, if I were to be hit with a sudden surge of determined energy (or more likely, a last-minute hair disaster), I feel confident knowing I could do a beer rinse again and emerge triumphant and delightfully shiny.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151406/Stocksy_txpf0c10511xfW000_Small_476491-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/bringing-back-the-90s-color-changing-nail-polish/,Beauty,Bringing Back The 90s: Color Changing Nail Polish,"<p>We all remember the wonders of 90s jewelry. The most coveted piece in any young 90s girl’s jewelry box was always a mood ring. How cool was it that someone could actually determine what your mood was just by looking at your ring!</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn’t until we grew older that we realized that the color changing properties were actually fueled by a temperature change, and not our actual moods (dammit), but that doesn’t mean that the concept wasn’t still cool.</p>
<p>Now, the 90s color-changing trend is coming back,but this time in a nail polish form. The polish line is called Shade Shifter from the brand Orly.</p>
<p>Essentially, the product is a new color-changing gel topcoat that changes pigment depending on body temperature and chemistry. This topcoat transforms into an entirely new shade in the same color palette, darker if you’re cold, and lighter if you’re warm.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, I may be 21 years old, but this seems like the coolest nail concept to date. I can’t wait to get my hands on this polish to give it a try, but I’ll have to go to a professional because, for the time being, this color is being reserved for professional use only.</p>
<p>I’m sure it’s only a matter of time before the public demands that this becomes an everyday product.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/weird-foods-make-hair-healthy/948692/,Beauty,4 Unlikely Foods To Help You Eat Your Way To Healthy Hair,"<p>My hair is the consistency of straw. I don’t dye it, I rarely blow-dry and I leave my conditioner in for exorbitant amounts of time — yet still, my hair looks a lot like Mufasa’s mane from “The Lion King.”</p>
<p>After testing&nbsp;countless products, I got to thinking, <em>what can I do to improve the strength and softness of my hair outside of my normal routine?</em></p>
<p>Your hair needs essential vitamins and antioxidants to be healthy, all of which can be found in all the usual suspects (avocado, coconut oil and olive oil). These are the ingredients beauty mags have been pushing on us&nbsp;since the dawn of DIY hair care.</p>
<p>But my question is: <em>Can you change your actual diet to turn your locks from lame to luscious?</em></p>
<p>I’m sick of mashing up avocado-honey masks and rinsing mayo from my hair and doing all this extra work. What can I <em>eat</em> instead of <em>apply</em>?</p>
<p>As it turns out, there are tons of&nbsp;unconventional foods chock&nbsp;full of healthy-hair essentials (like vitamin C and biotin). These hidden, secret hair hacks are jam-packed with goodies to&nbsp;give your mane a complete overhaul.</p>
<p>And the best part? You won’t ever have to spritz or spray a strand.</p>
<p>We know — it sounds <em>way</em> too simple — but here’s how to eat your way to healthy hair.</p>
<h2>Stop skipping breakfast!</h2>
<p>Picture this: It’s 8:15 in the morning and you were supposed to be out the door and on your way to the office 20 minutes ago. But skipping breakfast — and opting for an apple instead of those fluffy, protein- and biotin-filled eggs — is hurting more than just your morning productivity.</p>
<p><strong>The benefits:</strong> Eggs are a great source of protein — and you need tons of protein if you want healthy skin and nails. One egg contains about 6&nbsp;grams of protein (about 11 percent of your daily intake).&nbsp;According to beauty expert&nbsp;Sarah-Jane Beatty&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sjmuartistry"" target=""_blank"">Sarah-Jane Make Up Artistry</a>, eggs are essential for healthy hair.</p>
<p>As if finding an excuse to order another round of Eggs Benedict wasn’t enough, the fatty acids found in egg yolks helps make your hair stronger, shinier and even prevents split ends.</p>
<p><strong>The science behind it:</strong>As <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/18/vitamins-minerals-for-hair-health_n_3451747.html"" target=""_blank"">Huffington Post</a>&nbsp;point out, B-complex vitamins like&nbsp;biotin, niacin and cobalamin help to restore thickness and shine to dull hair.</p>
<p>Your&nbsp;hair and nails are comprised mostly of protein, so&nbsp;you need lots in your diet to make sure you’re doing the most for your stellar strands.</p>
<p>As the doctors&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/beauty/hair-health-11/eat-hair-type"" target=""_blank"">WebMd</a>&nbsp;note, 90 percent of your hair is in the growing phase, and it lasts two to three years. If you don’t give your locks enough protein-loaded love, they’ll enter “resting phase.”</p>
<p><strong><em>Pro tip:</em>&nbsp;</strong>Egg yolks are super rich in fatty acids so they make for&nbsp;<a href=""http://hair.allwomenstalk.com/recipes-for-homemade-hair-growth-treatments/4/"" target=""_blank"">stellar hair masks</a>. If you want to give one a whirl, try&nbsp;this egg-based recipe from <a href=""http://hair.allwomenstalk.com/recipes-for-homemade-hair-growth-treatments/4/"" target=""_blank"">All Women Stalk</a>.</p>

<h2>Sex isn’t the only way to get a good glow…</h2>
<p>OK, OK, we won’t disagree: There’s nothing like a healthy, just-loved sex glow. But if you don’t have a few minutes to spare for a quickie, stock up on pumpkin seeds instead. (Yep, pumpkin seeds.)</p>
<p><strong>The benefits:</strong>&nbsp;These little seeds are loaded with&nbsp;vitamin E. As mentioned by&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.livestrong.com/article/537418-how-to-rub-vitamin-e-on-the-scalp-to-promote-hair-growth/"" target=""_blank"">Live Strong</a>, vitamin E is essential for the growth and repair of tissue, which means it can&nbsp;help heal&nbsp;damaged hair follicles and make your hair grow.</p>
<p><strong>The science behind it:</strong> <a href=""https://nuts.com"" target=""_blank"">According to experts at Nuts.com</a>, pumpkin seeds are full of vitamin E, zinc and magnesium. These skin essentials help your cells regenerate more effectively and&nbsp;fight off the harmful bacteria. It even works to prevent acne. Score.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pro tip:</em></strong>&nbsp;Pumpkin seeds aren’t the only part of the pumpkin you can use. Use the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.seventeen.com/beauty/hair/news/a21547/diy-pumpkin-hair-conditioner/"" target=""_blank"">orange guts as a&nbsp;mask for a silky, smooth mane</a>&nbsp;by mixing it&nbsp;with coconut oil, yogurt and honey.</p>

<h2>Skip the buffalo wings — pass the celery, please.</h2>
<p>Before you reach for the last, hot sauce-soaked, juicy wing, let’s talk first. We aren’t suggesting you skip the wings in favor of the veggies (who wants to live life like&nbsp;<em>that</em>?), but before you gobble up all the meat, you’d be shocked to hear just how hair-healthy the celery is for your roots.</p>
<p><strong>The benefits:</strong>&nbsp;Since it contains multiple vitamins, a juicy celery stalk&nbsp;can&nbsp;help smooth&nbsp;strands. It’s also a great&nbsp;source of the mineral silica, which strengthens hair for toughness and anti-breakage.</p>
<p><strong>The science behind it:</strong>&nbsp;If you’re looking for the Triple Threat of hair, we’re pretty sure we’ve just found it. Vitamin A is a fierce anti-aging supplement; vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that helps fight aging (read: grays!); and vitamin E is a fantastic moisturizer and repairing agent. Together, all three&nbsp;nourish follicles for <a href=""http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/benefits-of-celery-for-skin-hair-and-health/"" target=""_blank"">smoother, shinier hair</a>.</p>
<p>Silica helps to strengthen your blood vessels, encouraging blood flow to your scalp to allow for robust hair growth.</p>
<p><em><strong>Pro tip:</strong> </em>For nourishment and thickening, try mashing celery to&nbsp;a pulp and applying to damp hair before rinsing thoroughly.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Be a mean meat-eater.</h2>
<p>What’s more ladylike&nbsp;than ordering a Ribeye on a first date and eating it with your hands?</p>
<p><strong>The benefits:</strong>&nbsp;Listen up brittle, thin-haired ladies: too little iron means bad news for your tresses, like <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/20/best-foods-for-hair_n_1597057.html"" target=""_blank"">premature balding</a>&nbsp;bad.&nbsp;Luckily, lean red meat is dense&nbsp;in iron, so you now have a foolproof excuse to chow down on a&nbsp;steak&nbsp;at dinner tonight.</p>
<p><strong>The science behind it:</strong> Iron is a major player in&nbsp;keeping your hair follicles healthy. According to <a href=""http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/what-eat-healthy-hair"" target=""_blank"">BBC Good Food</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The hair follicle and root are fed by a nutrient-rich blood supply.</p></blockquote>
<p>When your iron levels start to dip, your body feels the effects of anaemia, messing with the nutrients your hungry follicles need. A lack of the nutrient-rich mineral&nbsp;f*cks up your&nbsp;hair growth cycle and results in excessive shedding. <em>Yikes</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pro tip:</em></strong>&nbsp;On its own, red meat probably isn’t&nbsp;enough to get you the amount of iron you need. (And who wants to snack on jerky day after day?) Try a daily supplement or opt for a fresh spinach salad when you can.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04150913/Stocksy_txp7d39a704GkW000_Small_438350-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/mac-cosmetics-latest-collaboration-definition-luxury/849613/,Beauty,MAC Cosmetics’ Latest Collaboration Is The Definition Of Luxury,"<p>On November 26, MAC Cosmetics&nbsp;will unveil its annual holiday collection created in collaboration with fashion designer Prabal Gurung.</p>
<p>The 14-piece collection includes all of the standard makeup elements, including luxurious lipsticks in rich scarlet and violet hues, as well as shimmery glosses, eye and lip pencils and eye shadows. Also available is a small selection of fluffy brushes for bronzer and blush application.</p>
<p>Gurung’s decision to dive into the cosmetics world was inspired, in part, by his mother. Speaking to Harper’s Bazaar, <a href=""http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/fashion-designers/prabal-mac-cosmetics-collaboration"" target=""_blank"">the designer explained,</a></p>
<blockquote><p>My first foray into fashion was when I was back home in Nepal. Like many other designers, it was about my mother. I still remember her vanity case. She’d come back from work and sit in front of the mirror to get ready. I think one of the most powerful things that a woman has is that quiet time — it’s a process of transformation.</p></blockquote>
<p>His mother’s influence — and signature red lip — is reflected in Carmine Rouge, a creamy red lipstick and standout in the collection.</p>
<p>Though the makeup is all stunning, the real pièce de résistance of the collaboration is the opulent packaging.</p>Mac Cosmetics
<p>In an interview with InStyle,&nbsp;<a href=""http://news.instyle.com/2014/11/12/prabal-gurung-mac-cosmetics-interview-photos/"" target=""_blank"">Gurung explained</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s very rare that I look and the compact is of interest. I wanted it to be something that almost becomes an object of art.</p></blockquote>
<p>Drawing inspiration from artists Damien Hirst and Sylvie Fleury, the gilded gold packaging is detailed with a chainlink pattern and has a distinctive, Old Hollywood glamour-esque flair.</p>Mac Cosmetics
<p>MAC’s decision to team with Prabal Gurung was an easy one, as the two have been working together since the designer launched his eponymous label in 2009.</p>
<p>This is the beauty company’s highest-end collaboration to date, with prices ranging from $20 for eye and lip pencils to $70 for bronzer and brushes.</p>

A “Fifty Shades Of Grey”-inspired nail polish collection, set to roll out in time for Valentine’s Day — and, of course, the film’s highly-anticipated release (see the <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/entertainment/film/new-50-shades-of-grey-trailer/849647/"" target=""_blank"">latest naughty trailer here</a>).</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/best-hair-products-shampoo-free/1012076/,Beauty,Stylists Share The Top 4 Hair Products To Use When You’re Over Shampoo,"<p>Shampoo once seemed like a harmless friend, foaming up pleasantly in our&nbsp;hair, cleansing while we shouted our&nbsp;favorite Broadway tunes proudly in its face.</p>
<p>In the last few years, however, society’s&nbsp;replaced the simple pleasure of washing our hair&nbsp;with feelings of guilt and a need to lie about how often we scrub our scalps.</p>
<p>Among your girlfriends, the competition to see who can go the longest without ‘pooing has reached its peak.</p>
<p>Even if you’re still using shampoo, you know at least one woman with mermaid-like waves who raves about exclusively using conditioner.</p>
<p>In a world of conflicting reports, understanding if&nbsp;shampoo really is a villain&nbsp;is difficult. Suddenly, your bottle labels proclaim things like “sulfate-free” and “no alcohols” – all without worrying if you understanding why they are (or aren’t)&nbsp;important.</p>
<p>To decode the fear&nbsp;of shampoo, Elite Daily asked the experts: lead stylists familiar with a variety of hair types.</p>
<p>While none agreed on the degree of a shampoo-free existence, they did recommend speaking with your personal hair stylist, someone who’s an expert on your most important asset: your locks.</p>
<p>The problem, unsurprisingly, is every head of hair different. For moisture-seeking curls, shampoo’s drying chemicals can lead to lank, frizzy hair. But if you have thin or fine hair, you might not want to throw away the bottle just yet.</p>
<p>When it comes to shampoo, less certainly is more. Here’s how to scout the products to help cut back on your&nbsp;daily rinse.</p>
<h2>If you have thin or fine hair,&nbsp;hard-pass on the heavy products.</h2>
<p><b>The sitch:</b> If you have hair that’s easily weighed down&nbsp;with oil, stylist Matt Fugate of <a href=""http://sallyhershberger.com/salons/downtown-nyc/"" target=""_blank"">Sally Hershberger Downtown</a> recommends skipping shampoo on alternate days. Instead of washing, rinsing and repeating, use the time to hit the high notes on your favorite Bey jam instead.</p>
<p><b>The savior:</b> Dry shampoo… to give your hair lift and hide second- or third-day oils and grease. (We’re big fans of <a href=""http://www.houseofbeautyworld.com/badryshbl6oz.html?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=badryshbl6oz&amp;utm_campaign=bing_mc"" target=""_blank"">Batiste Dry Shampoo</a> in blush.)</p>
<hr>
<h2>If you have tight-knit curls, nix shampoo altogether.</h2>
<p><b>The sitch:</b> Jacquelyn Walent, senior stylist at <a href=""http://www.devacurl.com/salon.html"" target=""_blank"">Devachan Salon</a>, says curly-haired girls should use a cleansing conditioner rather than&nbsp;ever reaching for the shampoo. Instead of frizz and ill-defined waves, you’ll soon experience the kind of bouncing curls rarely seen outside of&nbsp;“Brave.”</p>
<p><b>The savior:</b> <a href=""http://www.sephora.com/low-poo-P378322"" target=""_blank"">DevaCurl’s Low-Poo</a>, developed especially with curls in mind. It may not lather like the shampoo you’ve used in the past, but the coconut-based&nbsp;conditioning cleanser&nbsp;ensures your hair stays clean and moisturized at the same time.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Color-treated hair keeps color&nbsp;longer with fewer washes.</h2>
<p><b>The sitch:</b> It’s imperative to wait two-to-three days before washing newly-dyed hair, but <a href=""http://www.bumbleandbumble.com/index.tmpl#1"" target=""_blank"">Bumble and Bumble</a> colorist Zoe Wiepert advises maintaining this&nbsp;habit no matter the week. She tells clients to prioritize conditioner, even using it alone on their ends to rid hair of any product buildup.</p>
<p><b>The savior:&nbsp;</b>Wiepert stands by Bumble and Bumble’s extra-gentle <a href=""http://www.bumbleandbumble.com/product/8927/22207/Products/ColorMinded/color-minded-sulfate-free-shampoo/index.tmpl"" target=""_blank"">Color Minded Sulfate Free Shampoo and Conditioner</a>, designed to nourish fragile hair, as well as the brand’s texturizer-meets-dry shampoo, <a href=""http://www.bumbleandbumble.com/product/11720/27810/Products/Hair-Powders/prt-powder/index.tmpl"" target=""_blank"">Prêt-à-powder</a>.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151354/Stocksy_txpa92d3c793gW000_Small_338631-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/what-does-sunscreen-do/1095000/,Beauty,"What You’re Doing Wrong When It Comes To Sun, Sunscreen And Your Skin","<p>Summer constantly calls for soaking up vitamin D, making sunscreen&nbsp;more necessary&nbsp;than binge-watching shows on Netflix.</p>
<p>Instead of guarding our skin from the galaxy’s biggest (and deadliest) star, we’ve become more preoccupied with bathing in makeup or self-diagnosing benign ailments via WebMD.</p>
<p>The season for&nbsp;slathering your skin in topical sun protection, is upon us — and so is preventing wrinkles and keeping our SPF levels on fleek.</p>
<p>We didn’t major in&nbsp;FDA cosmetic labels, so&nbsp;Elite Daily turned to&nbsp;board-certified dermatologist Jessica Krant, M.D. of <a href=""http://www.laserskinsurgery.com/"" target=""_blank"">Laser &amp; Skin Surgery Center</a> of New York in Manhattan and Assistant Clinical Professor of Dermatology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center to&nbsp;shed some (non-UV) light on the things we probably should&nbsp;know about sunscreen.</p>
<p>The added bonus? She didn’t burn us.</p>
<h2>6. “I don’t need sunscreen because of my melanin-rich skin.”</h2>
<figure><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://elitedaily.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/1x1-clear.png"" data-lazy-src=""https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/46/9f/3e/469f3e32f7a1dd1ed553aae97ba42ce2.jpg"" data-lazy-backup=""https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/46/9f/3e/469f3e32f7a1dd1ed553aae97ba42ce2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""250""><noscript><img class=""alignnone"" src=""https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/46/9f/3e/469f3e32f7a1dd1ed553aae97ba42ce2.jpg"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""250""></noscript><br>
Dr. Krant is straight to the point:&nbsp;You’re wrong.<p></p>
<blockquote><p>“Skin color in reality is a continuous spectrum,” she explains. “Even the darkest skin types are at risk for skin cancer given different combinations of genetic factors, environmental factors, and family history.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So while women with darker complexions believe anti-aging is Mother Nature’s blessing, applying SPF helps you find yor own&nbsp;personal fountain of youth.</p>
<p>No race and skin type is exempt, either.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Sunscreen helps minimize damage from the sun’s UV rays that lead to signs of aging like irregular pigmentation, fine lines and dullness,” Dr. Krant said.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>5. There are just way too many options, so give it to me straight: Which SPF is best?</h2>
<p><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://elitedaily.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/1x1-clear.png"" data-lazy-src=""http://www.sharegif.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/dont-you-dare-sit-there-and-tell-me-that-i-did-not-try-i-did.gif"" data-lazy-backup=""http://www.sharegif.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/dont-you-dare-sit-there-and-tell-me-that-i-did-not-try-i-did.gif"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""260""><noscript><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://www.sharegif.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/dont-you-dare-sit-there-and-tell-me-that-i-did-not-try-i-did.gif"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""260""></noscript></p></figure>
<p>Rule of thumb: Go high or go home.</p>
<p>If you want to block UV rays better than Hope Solo, the <a href=""https://www.aad.org/"" target=""_blank"">American Academy of Dermatology</a> recommends daily use of SPF 30 or higher.</p>
<p>However, Krant suggests turning up the sunscreen levels to 50 so your skin knows it’s real. She explains,</p>
<blockquote><p>The higher the SPF, the more protection you will get from the sun’s UVB rays. Higher SPF sunscreens also tend to have better quality UVA protection these days.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ideally, your go-to sunscreen should be broad spectrum, no less than SPF 30 and at least 80-minute water-resistant time.</p>
<p>Personal tip: Make sure you can stomach the scent to ensure regular use.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. How much SPF is too much SPF?</h2>
<figure><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://elitedaily.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/1x1-clear.png"" data-lazy-src=""http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly611eTRSD1qiljtlo1_500.gif"" data-lazy-backup=""http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly611eTRSD1qiljtlo1_500.gif"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""273""><noscript><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly611eTRSD1qiljtlo1_500.gif"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""273""></noscript></figure>
<p>While “everything in moderation” is a general life rule, it doesn’t apply here.</p>
<p>Beauty products runneth over with SPF ingredients, and “there’s no such thing as too much in terms of the effectiveness of sunscreen,” Dr. Krant assures.</p>
<p>But, to be clear:</p>
<blockquote><p>Layering SPFs does not add or multiply them. Some protection is better than none.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plus, you won’t have to worry about missing a spot.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. “If I’m allergic to SPF, what’s a good, natural alternative?”</h2>
<figure><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://elitedaily.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/1x1-clear.png"" data-lazy-src=""http://31.media.tumblr.com/5cbf95f63b4e4038e7613eb680061783/tumblr_n8k9tgm6mj1qft49to1_500.gif"" data-lazy-backup=""http://31.media.tumblr.com/5cbf95f63b4e4038e7613eb680061783/tumblr_n8k9tgm6mj1qft49to1_500.gif"" alt="""" width=""490"" height=""368""><noscript><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://31.media.tumblr.com/5cbf95f63b4e4038e7613eb680061783/tumblr_n8k9tgm6mj1qft49to1_500.gif"" alt="""" width=""490"" height=""368""></noscript></figure>
<p>Look, there’s no way around sunscreen.</p>
<p>If you reject sunscreen the way hip-hop does Iggy Azalea, zero in on the ingredient causing your skin to throw a fit.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There are no pills, foods or natural oils that provide equivalent protection to real sunscreen,” says Dr. Krant. “If a chemical sunscreen ingredient such as Oxybenzone is causing a true allergy, you might do perfectly well with chemical-free physical blockers, such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide&nbsp;as&nbsp;the sunscreen’s active ingredients.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Protect your temple from the harsh sun by layering up with “sun-protective hats, sunglasses and clothing” that boast UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) 50 or more.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. “Do I need to reapply before and after I get out of the water?”</h2>
<figure><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://elitedaily.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/1x1-clear.png"" data-lazy-src=""http://img.pandawhale.com/85720-My-vaginas-sweating-gif-Americ-xgVE.gif"" data-lazy-backup=""http://img.pandawhale.com/85720-My-vaginas-sweating-gif-Americ-xgVE.gif"" alt="""" width=""627"" height=""314""><noscript><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://img.pandawhale.com/85720-My-vaginas-sweating-gif-Americ-xgVE.gif"" alt="""" width=""627"" height=""314""></noscript></figure>
<p>If perspiring is on your agenda, along with pool-hopping and ocean swims, pack on a&nbsp;layer of sunblock for every <em>two</em> hours spent baking&nbsp;under sun rays.</p>
<p>And if you needed the extra oomph: “Reapplying right after swimming is a good idea,” Krant says.</p>
<hr>
<h2>1. “Can I apply sunscreen over a current skin condition?”</h2>
<figure><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://elitedaily.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/1x1-clear.png"" data-lazy-src=""http://media.giphy.com/media/uMjpxuVCbnmtG/giphy.gif"" data-lazy-backup=""http://media.giphy.com/media/uMjpxuVCbnmtG/giphy.gif"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""203""><noscript><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://media.giphy.com/media/uMjpxuVCbnmtG/giphy.gif"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""203""></noscript></figure>
<p>Don’t skip the sun-protecting step in your beauty routine due to some pesky skin issue.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Although some sunscreen products will be more irritating than others, it’s safe,” Krant tells us.</p>
<p>“So figure out your well-tolerated product by trial and error before going on vacay without it!”</p></blockquote></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SunblockEliteDaily-800x399.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/unconventional-beauty-products-tape-2/,Beauty,Unconventional Beauty Products: Tape,"<p>Who doesn’t love home remedies and tricks? It’s such a relief to know that your life can be made so much easier, just by utilizing certain household products that you almost guaranteed already have in your home.</p>
<p>One of the most useful beauty tips I’ve stumbled upon over the years requires the use of one of the most well-known home products out there: tape. Just simple scotch tape. How could tape help you with your beauty routine you ask? By making your smoky eye application a little bit more precise, that’s how.</p>
<p>Have you ever been in the process of applying your smoky eye, eye shadow only to realize that you were getting shadow residue all of the side of your face? Of course you have, it sucks.&nbsp; To prevent such a beauty disaster (maybe not disaster but, you get what I mean), try applying one strip of tape diagonally on the side of your eye (view below) and apply your makeup as usual.</p>
<p>When you’re done with your eye makeup masterpiece, simply remove the piece of tape to find a clean and precise outer line of your eye shadow. No more wiping shadow off of the side of your face, you’re all ready to go.</p>
<p>How convenient is this trick? Would you ever use tape while applying your makeup?</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/seasonal-secrets-hair-of-your-dreams/998176/,Beauty,5 Seasonal Secrets To Get The Flawless Hair Of Your Dreams,"<p>Unlike many women I know, I’ve never been huge on haircare.</p>
<p>Instead, I abide by a less-is-more philosophy when it comes to my strands. Aside from the necessary maintenance, like shampooing (<a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/woman-hasnt-used-shampoo-six-years-hair-amazing/993268/"" target=""_blank"">which may not even be necessary</a>) and the occasional (read: biannual) trim, I tend to channel John Lennon and let it be.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I can only do this because my hair has never been particularly problematic. I’d imagine if it were fussier, I’d have a very different approach to haircare.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, however, I’ve noticed my hair has… changed. Normally strong and shiny, it’s become duller, brittle. Even the texture is different — these days it feels rougher.</p>
<p>Frustrated, I recently reached out to Dhiran Mistry, a stylist at Manhattan’s <a href=""https://johnbarrett.com"" target=""_blank"">John Barrett Salon</a>, and celebrity stylist and <a href=""http://www.rowentabeauty.com/"" target=""_blank"">Rowenta Beauty</a> ambassador&nbsp;<a href=""https://instagram.com/josueperezhair/"" target=""_blank"">Josue Perez</a> to&nbsp;help get to the bottom of whatever was causing my hair woes.</p>
<p>Both gave me the same answer: It’s seasonal.</p>
<p>Though it never occurred to me that the weather could be to blame (especially now that it’s <em>finally</em> spring), it makes perfect sense. We already know colder temps wreak havoc on our skin. Hair, it turns out, is no different.</p>
<p>Revitalizing my mane after winter (especially one as uncharacteristically brutal as this year’s was) requires not only treating our damaged strands, but tweaking our routines to ensure our hair stays healthy as the temps rise.</p>
<p>Start practicing your shampoo commercial hair flip, ladies; your locks will look so good it hurts.</p>
<h2>It’s time to cut your losses.</h2>
<p><b>Why:</b> First things first: Your hair is probably dead. (Sorry.) And contrary to what “The Walking Dead” may have you believe, dead things do not come back to life. The damage sustained over the winter (and at the hands of your blowdryer) is pretty much irreparable.</p>
<p><b>What to do: </b>If you want to get rid of dry, brittle ends, “now is the time to cut your hair,” according to Mistry. Perez concedes a good chop — we’re talking a few inches here — “goes a long way in making the hair look healthier.”</p>
<p><b>Try:</b> Mistry suggests going for the <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/rise-of-lob-haircut-photos/922209/"" target=""_blank"">beloved lob</a> this spring. “It’s definitely shorter,” he says, but “still able to be tied back” in the summer.</p>
<p><em><b>Insider tip:</b></em>&nbsp;If you’re worried&nbsp;about cutting too much off, don’t be. Says Mistry: “Hair grows quickly over the summer because of extra vitamins and nutrients from the sun.” So even if your stylist gets scissor-happy, your locks will grow back soon enough.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Moisture is the essence of wetness, and wetness is the essence of moisture.</h2>
<p><b>Why</b>: “Hair restoration is key after a dry winter,” says Perez. ’Nuff said.</p>
<p><b>What to do:</b> Replenish all the lacking moisture with a deep-conditioning treatment. It won’t fix what’s already broken (see above), but it will restore moisture to dried strands and prevent future damage.</p>
<p><b>Try</b>: Mistry recommends using “weekly or monthly masque treatments at home,” such as <a href=""http://www.shuuemuraartofhair-usa.com/ultimate_remedy_extreme_restoration_treatment/E0928800.html"" target=""_blank"">Shu Uemura Ultimate Remedy Extreme Restoration Treatment</a>, which, he says, “restores health to hair.” Perez likes the more affordable but equally effective <a href=""http://www.moroccanoil.com/canada/h_ca_en/restorative-hair-mask"" target=""_blank"">MoroccanOil Restorative Hair Mask</a>.</p>
<p><em><b>Insider tip:</b></em> Leave the mask in your hair overnight (wrapped in a shower cap) for super-silky strands. Says Mistry, “wrapping will help contain the heat,” which “helps the masque penetrate the hair shaft.”</p>
<hr>
<h2>You’ve got to feed the beast.</h2>
<p><b>Why</b>: Just like the skin on your face and body, during “the winter months, the scalp gets super dry,” explains Mistry. Blasting your skull with the blowdryer, unsurprisingly, does not help.</p>
<p><b>What to do:</b> Care for a dry scalp the same way you would dry skin: moisturizer (keep in mind, however, your trusty Lubriderm won’t work here).</p>
<p><b>Try</b>: “I would definitely recommend a scalp treatment,” Mistry says. He suggests “<a href=""http://www.shuuemuraartofhair-usa.com/essential_drops/SU051.html"" target=""_blank"">Shu Uemura Essential</a> drops, [which] exfoliate and nourish the scalp.” Another we love? <a href=""http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/aveda-dry-remedy-daily-moisturizing-oil/3665744?cm_mmc=Google_Product_Ads_pla_online-_-datafeed-_-women:hair_care:hair_styling_product-_-912431&amp;mr:referralID=d6451711-e1e8-11e4-8635-001b2166becc"" target=""_blank"">Aveda’s “Dry Remedy” Daily Moisturizing Oil</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Insider tip:</strong> </em>It’s a splurge, but if you can afford it, try <a href=""http://www.restorsea.com/Restorsea-R345-Revitalizing-Scalp-Treatment/dp/B00JFHXEOS"" target=""_blank"">Restorsea’s Revitalizing Scalp Treatment</a>. Not only does it hydrate the scalp — it actually helps hair grow, thanks to a mélange of high-tech ingredients (like Hesperidin) to&nbsp;stimulate blood flow and clear dead cells out of the hair follicles.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Protect your assets.</h2>
<p><b>Why</b>: Now it’s warmer, chances are you’ll be spending more time outside. (Yay!) Unfortunately, Mistry cautions, “staying in the sun dries [the hair] out.” And prolonged exposure to salt and sand only adds to the sun’s “dry and damaging effects on the hair.” (Boo!)</p>
<p><b>What to do:</b> Prevent damage the way mama taught you: with sunscreen. Look for specially-formulated hair products with UVA/ UVB protection.</p>
<p><b>Try</b>: Pre-sun, prime your strands with SPF. Try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Nios-SPF-Leave-In-Conditioner-Ounce/dp/B00J1OZ0GU"" target=""_blank"">Nios Shield Hair Gel and Leave In Conditioner SPF 15</a> or <a href=""http://www.target.com/p/dessange-salon-color-restore-top-coat-serum-treatment-3-4-oz/-/A-15651114"" target=""_blank"">Dessange Paris Color Protecting Top Coat Serum with UV filters</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Insider tip:</strong></em>&nbsp;In a pinch, a wide-brimmed hat will keep you covered (and lookin’ chic as hell).</p>
<hr>
<h2><b>Fifth Step: Maintain</b></h2>
<p><b>Why</b>: “Your hair will be producing more of its natural oils as it gets more humid out,” Perez explains. So forget your winter routine — those heavy products will only weigh down your hair come spring and summer.</p>
<p><b>What to do</b>: “Switch to lighter shampoos, conditioners, serums and styling sprays,” Perez suggests. “Too much moisture in the hair, combined with the humid weather, will cause your hair to look greasy more quickly.”</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/bikini-bodies-feeling-good-bathing-suit-half-battle/,Beauty,Bikini Bodies: Why Feeling Good In Your Bathing Suit Is Half The Battle,"<p>I, like every other bagel-addicted woman, have a complicated relationship with summertime. Or more specifically, the parts in which we prance around practically naked with nowhere to hide. Those moments especially suck.</p>
<p>But what’s even more anxiety-provoking than the actual swimsuit part is the slow build up to bikini season. The few months leading up to Memorial Day weekend can make even the healthiest woman feel off her game.</p>
<p>Suddenly it’s like no one wants to have an extra appetizer to share at dinner. We’re switching from grabbing drinks to grabbing juices.</p>
<p>And all we can talk about is which gym class torches the most calories. The pressure to look great in a bathing suit is reinforced from all facets of life.</p>
<p>But here’s a pressure that is noticeably absent: feeling great in your bikini. What happens when you don’t look like all the fit girls in the catalogs?</p>
<p>We spend too much time trying to emulate the bodies of these women, and not enough time working on our attitudes. We automatically assume that if we’re the toned-est, thinnest, leanest possible humans then our swimsuits will practically wear themselves.</p>
<p>The reality is though that no matter how amazing you look in your bikini, if you’re not feeling your best self, there’s no way you can be your best self.</p>
<p>Countless summers I’ve been the girl who quickly reaches for her towel the minute she steps out of the pool, or the girl who buys a trendy cover-up and doesn’t take it off all day.</p>
<p>Even while remaining modestly covered, I couldn’t fully enjoy myself because I still felt bad for not proudly wearing my swimsuit.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until a recent vacation with my mom, in which I felt completely uninhibited in my bikini, did I realize that hiding my body wasn’t helping my cause — it was hurting it.</p>
<p>Regardless if you’re actually doing anything shady, when you behave like you have something to conceal (be it your body or a secret or whatever), you’re going to look wrong or guilty.</p>
<p>I always preferred to keep my shorts on because I thought people wouldn’t be able to tell that my thighs were three times the size as everyone else’s.</p>
<p>The only person buying into this foolishness is myself. In reality, I’m just zeroing in and letting everyone know that that I have big legs and feel less-than-stellar about it. No matter how much you try to obscure your true figure, people will be able to recognize the difference.</p>
<p>Attempting to disguise yourself only draws more attention to your body and sets you up for a “big reveal” later. Instead of learning to mask your figure, it’s way more beneficial to learn to feel confident with your figure.</p>
<p>And despite our perceived sizes, no one is looking away. On my vacation with my mom, I wore my bathing suits comfortably and without second thought. (It’s my mom. She’s definitely not judging me, and I was there to relax, not impress anyone.)</p>
<p>I didn’t do anything special to draw extra attention to myself, yet more women were complimenting my bikinis and more men were swimming my way in the ocean.</p>
<p>It was as if shredding my insecurity also shredded my stomach…Well, sort of, let’s not get too carried away.</p>
<p>I know it sounds trite and many people are probably rolling their eyes, thinking this preaching is an after-school special nonsense and complete B.S. And I’ve totally been there.</p>
<p>I’ve read these “feel good, look good”/ “it’s what’s on the inside that counts” articles and thought they were for insecure people who needed to tell themselves nice, hopeful things. But until you truly embrace these words and put them into practice, they’re going to seem like just that. Words.</p>
<p>After years of hiding behind spools of fabric, large bodies of water, and any other belly-eliminating contraptions (high-waisted pants work wonders), I’ve realized something: Feeling good about yourself will get you much further than simply looking the part.</p>
<p>Sure dressing for the role certainly helps, but loving that your physique has a little extra sum-sum gives your allure and swagger a little extra sum-sum.</p>
<p>Work to feel good. Whatever that means for you, if you’re a Kardashian or a Kate. I’m not saying we should all stuff our faces and then parade around preaching.</p>
<p>I’m saying that if you feel best even when you don’t look like everybody else, then you’ll stand out for the right reasons. Shining from within is just as important as radiating on the outside.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/the-true-traumatic-account-of-a-woman-shopping-for-a-bikini/,Beauty,"The True, Traumatic Account Of A Woman Shopping For A Bikini","<p>Dear Unnamed Bikini Store,</p>
<p>I just wanted to say thank you. Thanks a lot for a traumatic, hideous, painful experience that, to my utter misery, I have to go through on an annual basis.</p>
<p>I had a breakdown yesterday, thanks to you.</p>
<p>It was my second trip this week; I stupidly returned, despite my better judgment, after an equally disastrous visit the day before. I hardly know where to start, but I will try. In defense of women everywhere, I will bring you down.</p>
<p>First, your bikinis were obviously designed by one of two things: a masochist or a man. Probably the latter. A masochist wouldn’t be so stupid as to think that A)&nbsp;breasts naturally hover centimeters below the chin, with no involuntary jiggle or succumbing to gravity, and B) breasts are the exact same size. Breasts are are not the same size. No woman in the world has two breasts that are exactly the same size.</p>
<p>I begrudgingly accept that society has preconditioned you to think this way, but when you see photos of a perfectly proportioned Gisele Bundchen, remember she is either a walking Photoshop success story or an alien species.&nbsp;You had better start taking this into account, unnamed bikini store.</p>
<p>So tell me, why should I be forced to buy a bikini together — two pieces the same size — rather than separately, in mismatched sizes, as nature and my body’s fondness for converting french fries to cellulite on my thighs specifically intended?</p>
<p>I must give you some credit, though: You understand the value of choice. God forbid I have one, two or three bikinis from which to choose, resulting in a fairly simple process that wouldn’t force me to expound too much brainpower or leave me too traumatized.</p>
<p>But no, SO many colors and patterns and options exist. Does your inept staff know the differences and value of each choice, or is it all part of a plot meant to reduce me to tears so I buy whatever first grasps my attention?</p>
<p>Halter-tops, rouging, beads, ties, buckles – so many styles, so many torturous options designed to confuse and leave red welts on my body, so I can feel oh-so attractive as I emerge from the ocean.</p>
<p>My thoughts tumble wildly inside your hideous, cruelly unflattering, halogen-lit chain store. Why go on vacation at all? Who needs this? Is this amount of torturous preparation even worth the apparent joy and comfort my vacation will provide?</p>
<p>Why, after centuries of women being subjected and objectified, do I even care enough to worry at all about what I wear to cover the parts of my body that society says I must cover?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I do care, even though you seemingly don’t. If you did, surely you would do something about the changing room situation. It’s full of overly friendly staff members who disappear the moment you actually need them — staff who want you to have a nice day, but who can’t be bothered to find you a different size.</p>
<p>Staff who, too, are probably so traumatized by their work environments full of women bemoaning and bewailing themselves so much that they’re just counting down to when their shift ends and they can leave the asylum — aka changing rooms so tiny that taking off your coat becomes an ordeal.</p>
<p>And, let me tell you, anyone who hasn’t taken off coat and sweater and thermal underwear to reveal white, dimpled, hasn’t–seen-the-sun-or-a-razor-in-months skin, to put on two teeny pieces of fabric and to step outside to look in the mirror – and, God forbid, show a mom or friend – really will never know the meaning of torture.</p>
<p>As for going bikini shopping with a skinnier mother or friend, well, it’s your funeral. I leave you to your own peril. Women have to be self-protective to ensure that our levels of self-esteem don’t plummet any more than today’s advertisements and magazines call for them to.</p>
<p>Perhaps the answer, you might say, is the one-piece — an elegant option that covers far more skin than its cheeky sister.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are right, but then there are so many other things to consider: Will everyone know I’m doing this to avoid the bikini? Will it squish my fat or highlight it?</p>
<p>Is it possible to be sexy in a swimsuit? OH GOD, does this mean I’ll have to go back in there?</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/spooky-style/809428/,Beauty,6 Ways To Stay Edgy-Chic With A Hint Of Spooky This Season,"<p>There is something about the crisp fall air that makes me want to sport the darkest color of nail polish and rock a somber shade of lipstick.</p>
<p>Maybe it has to do with the fact that the nights are growing longer and the days are getting shorter. Or maybe, it’s in knowing that ghosts and goblins will soon grace us with their presence, given that Halloween is around the corner.</p>
<p>Edgy trends have become chic.&nbsp;Fashionistas today master the fad by integrating touches of darkness into their own wardrobe.&nbsp;Horror has become trendy and is infiltrating pop-culture from all corners.</p>
<p>From what we wear — skulls, dark nail polish, etc. — to what we watch — “The Walking Dead,” “American Horror Story,” etc. —, spooky is styling.</p>
<p><a title=""The Horrifically Horrifying Horror Blog"" href=""http://thehorrificallyhorrifyinghorrorblog.com/2012/11/05/dress-in-the-dark-horror-in-haute-couture-by-ives-hovanessian/"" target=""_blank"">The Horrifically Horrifying Horror Blog</a>&nbsp;Writer&nbsp;Ives Hovanessian,&nbsp;wrote it best,</p>
<blockquote><p>No longer limited to black nail polish and Halloween costumes, horror has slithered onto the runways of Paris, New York and Milan, and is being worn by everyone from A-List celebrities to teenage girls on a Hot Topic budget.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alexander McQueen is the king of this trend; the brilliant, late fashion designer is the mastermind of showcasing spookiness as a style. His collections feature the primary colors of black and white, as well as drapey, dark silhouettes, as if to cast a mysterious spell on the clothing.</p>
<p>Sarah Burton, creative director at Alexander McQueen, told <a title=""vogue"" href=""http://www.vogue.com/fashion-week/861768/alexander-mcqueen-fall-2014/"" target=""_blank"">Vogue</a>&nbsp;the idea behind the Fall 2014 line was, “‘Beauty and the Beast’ — a wild, beautiful fairytale.” This is another common theme in today’s pop culture (think “True Blood,” “Twilight,” etc.).</p>
<p>This contemporary trend is peppered with an overcast of darkness and everyone from Miley Cyrus to Kylie Jenner, to&nbsp;your friends and mine, want to be a part of it.</p>
<p>Millennials adorn themselves in edgy-chic ensembles worthy of salsa dancing with skeletons or vacationing with vampires.</p>
<p>Again, the trend is spooky, stylish and easy to replicate. Here are some of my favorite style tips for keeping your look edgy, yet chic, and to help to steer clear of appearing too Bella Swan post-vampire transition.</p>
<h2>1. Find a killer dark shade of lipstick</h2>
<p>Dramatic makeup is one of the best accessories. Find a shade that goes well with your skin tone and it will add a funky flare to any outfit. If you choose to do a dark lip, go light on the other makeup. The goal is to look edgy, yet tasteful — and clown faces definitely don’t fit that description.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. You can never have too much dark nail polish</h2>
<p>Nothing says fall like a rich shade of dark nail polish. Wicked by Essie has been my go-to; however, the Fall 2014 color by Chanel is Orage (not orange). Check it out; it’s very dark. There are many others out there, and dark nails create a dramatic look you can wear for days.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Leather leggings are crucial</h2>
<p>Whether you opt for the real deal or an animal-friendly version, leather leggings spruce up any outfit and are a great transitional piece from dressy to casual. Pair them with an oversized sweater and boots during the day or throw on a pair of heels and a cute top for a night out.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Cat-eye makeup</h2>
<p>This look is not reserved for Cat Woman and Rachel Zoe; although, they definitely rock it. This makeup technique is feminine and fun. I’ve found that liquid eyeliner works best.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. Skulls, skulls and more skulls</h2>
<p>Skulls appear on everything from clothing to jewelry, to accessories, to the occasional tramp-stamp tattoo. It’s a hot trend right now, but avoid overkill. A&nbsp;simple skull embellishment adds an Alexander McQueen-esque touch to any article of clothing or accessory without spending a fortune.</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. Less is more</h2>
<p>No one wants to look like he or she&nbsp;bought out Hot Topic’s inventory. Add subtle touches to simple outfits, and you’ll master the look.</p>
<p>Whether it’s your Monday-through-Friday work ensemble or your weekend fashion statement, remember to throw a little Halloween horror into the mix. Who knows? You may see it on the catwalk sooner than you think.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/cant-resist-makeup-packaging-photos/1002756/,Beauty,Why You Can’t Resist Beautiful Makeup Packaging (And Why You’re Not Alone),"<p>“Budgets were made to be broken” is the credo I always rattle off&nbsp;inwardly&nbsp;before&nbsp;slipping yet another item into my shopping basket.</p>
<p>As a relatively recent college graduate to whom steady paychecks still seem like a surprise, I’ve learned to plan thrifty meals and bargain clothing buys.</p>
<p>The one thing I cannot resist, however, is a beautiful box of makeup.</p>
<p>Drawn to glittering palettes the way Donatella Versace is surely pulled toward boxes of platinum hair dye (and extremely high-cost salon visits), I just can’t look away from a modern-looking font or inviting Instagram ad campaign.</p>
<p>If a product pops&nbsp;up on beauty blogs, it won’t be long before I find an excuse to add it to my Sephora cart.</p>
<p>Unlike this season’s hot trend – here’s looking at you, fringed bags – makeup is a timeless investment. In every product, art meets wearable design.</p>
<p>Unlike the $550 Apple Watch, however, a cosmetic product means more than just bragging rights to the hottest item in tech.</p>
<p>A new palette is a chance to hone my cosmetic technique, usually with the help of <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/makeupaddiction"" target=""_blank"">/r/makeupaddiction</a>. Instead of plain-Jane cat eye, I can use my new <a href=""http://www.sephora.com/long-lasting-kohl-pencil-P377785"" target=""_blank"">Kohl Pencil</a>&nbsp;to perfect a Korean puppy eye or Elizabeth Taylor’s smoldering Cleopatra.</p>
<p>Curious to know why I’m so happy to hand over my credit cards at beauty supply stores all over town, I contacted two brands making waves for their designs: <a href=""https://www.hourglasscosmetics.com/"" target=""_blank"">Hourglass Cosmetics</a>, responsible for&nbsp;the knockout Modernist Eyeshadow Palette, and <a href=""http://opi.com/"" target=""_blank"">OPI</a>, the brand we all know for their&nbsp;must-have nail color collections each season.</p>
<p>Beautiful products, it seems, are a result&nbsp;of a two-part&nbsp;magic combination: a high-quality cosmetic product, cleverly planned package and skillful marketing. Because if you’re drawn to a product, these teams have done their job correctly.</p>
<h2>A must-have product means a focus on the woman wearing it.</h2>
<p>In order to create a truly standout beauty product, both Hourglass Cosmetics and OPI&nbsp;shared the importance of knowing their customers’ taste.</p>
<p>The<a href=""http://www.sephora.com/modernist-eyeshadow-palette-P392707"" target=""_blank""> Modernist Palette</a> is sleek and minimalist with “luxurious” finishes in order to catch the eye of the ideal Hourglass woman, whom Vice President of Marketing Christina Okubo dubs “independent and on-the-go” while depending on cosmetics to “enhance and make her life easier.”</p>
<p>Conversely, OPI tailors lacquers&nbsp;names to bring fun and liveliness to every drugstore aisle. Lacquer naming meetings, a closely-guarded affair, involve fewer than 10&nbsp;staff members from different levels of&nbsp;the company.</p>
<p>They pick a theme for the evening, whether that’s a destination like fall’s <a href=""http://opi.com/color/collections/nordic"" target=""_blank"">“Nordic”</a> collection or this spring’s <a href=""http://opi.com/color/collections/hawaii"" target=""_blank"">“Hawaii”</a> shades, and order food to match, reports OPI Executive Vice President Suzi Weiss-Fischmann.</p>
<p>OPI polishes, named in an evening of food and laughter, reflect a cosmopolitan, youthful customer.</p>
<hr>
<h2>To catch a customer’s eye, think outside the beauty box.</h2>
<p>At the most basic level, beauty products have to catch the eye&nbsp;of shoppers skimming rows of lookalike brands.</p>
<p>When it came to the&nbsp;Modernist Palette, available in shades like “Graphite” and the earthy “Osbcura,” Okubo says Hourglass set out to revamp the smokey-eye experience.</p>
<p>Metallic-covered palettes, inspired by artists’ paints, make blending multi-shade looks an easy task.</p>
<p>Okubo elaborated on the design process, explaining,</p>
<blockquote><p>Given that we wanted to create a very fluid, continuous customer experience, we looked to organic and geographical shapes for inspiration, such as water and sand.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Hourglass tailors its&nbsp;dreamy brand for an ideal woman, OPI works from trends&nbsp;happening on the runways and in pop culture.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;Weiss-Fischmann, the secret to eye-catching lacquer names lies in adding a sense of humor to situations both real and imagined.</p>
<p>She <a href=""http://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/news/a11960/opi-nail-naming-queen/"" target=""_blank"">told Cosmopolitan</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2006, we had the OPI Mexican collection color, and <a href=""http://opi.com/color/nail-lacquer/my-chihuahua-bites"" target=""_blank"">My Chihuahua Bites!</a>&nbsp;— a bright orange polish that earned its name because the weekend before, I was bit by a chihuahua. Ouch! Not the best story, but a great name and polish certainly came out of it.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>For those who love them, beauty products are an investment in creativity.</h2>
<p>Weiss-Fischmann and&nbsp;Okubo, executives at two very different cosmetic brands, both share a desire to provide their beauty-loving customers with products exciting enough to create those shopping butterflies in your stomach as you wait to receive your order.</p>
<p>Although budgets are important, a sense of joy and creativity is equally so.</p>
<p>Whether picking up a new nail polish or blending an eyeshadow shade you’ve never tried before,&nbsp;rest assured it’s been tailored for you by people who love trying new products just as much as you do.</p>
<p>Hold your head high, beauty enthusiasts, and shop on.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151406/Stocksy_txpf0c10511xfW000_Small_476491-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/nipple-tattooing-the-uks-latest-trend/,Beauty,Nipple Tattooing: The UK’s Latest Trend,"<p>Leave it to Europe to always have the most… unique budding trends. It seems as if women in the United Kingdom are becoming partial to a certain type of cosmetic procedure. Cosmetic procedures are nothing out of the ordinary, until you find out the cosmetic procedure in question: nipple tattooing.</p>
<p>It seems as if women from Liverpool have taken to darkening and defining their nipples via tattoo application. This semi-permanent form of tattooing has been all the rage in Liverpool for some time and is on it’s way over to Essex, taking the UK by storm.</p>
<p>Nipple tattooing, which is fondly nicknamed “tittooing,” is a process that was originally meant to be a medical procedure for women undergoing breast reconstruction. Now, it’s become a cosmetic trend for women who wish for darker, enlarged and more defined nipples and the surrounding areola. The semi-permanent treatment can last a lifetime if you keep up with regular applications.</p>
<p>Gail Proudman, an independent clinician based in Merseyside, says that she tattoos the nipples of more than three women a week and has seen a huge and continuing increase in young women opting for the cosmetic trend.</p>
<p>She explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>“A lot of people want their nipples made darker. It’s the fashion. Some people think theirs are too pink or their boyfriends want them done. I think sometimes they are doing it because they are conscious of them being pale and they think it’s fashionable to have dark nipples. They’ll look at the magazines and page 3 and unfortunately a lot of it might be peer pressure.</p>
<p>“The girls get them done so they can go topless and not be embarrassed, or when they’re in a changing room and getting changed. They can go on holiday in front of their partners, go for massages, spray tans and just not be conscious of their body.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The procedure, which can last from 12-18 months, takes two hours to perform and can cost up to 1,200 pounds for both nipples. Do you think this procedure will cross overseas and become popular with us Americans? I’m not too sure…</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/woman-accidentally-uses-super-glue-instead-of-chapstick/,Beauty,Woman Attempts to Apply Chapstick and Winds Up Super Gluing Her Lips Shut,"<p>When the police received a 9-1-1 call at around midnight a couple of nights ago, they thought they could be dealing with a hostage situation when the woman who called was mumbling as if she as unable to open her mouth. (Personally, I would’ve been like WTF speak up assh*le, but I guess that’s one of the many reasons why I’m not a police officer.)</p>
<p>When they arrived at her house, prepared for horror, they found out that this lady had accidently applied super glue to her lips instead of chapstick.</p>
<p>Ok… why the hell do you keep your super glue near your chapstick? That’s not only strange as f*ck, but also dangerous.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, this woman was rushed to the hospital and is now okay.</p>
<p>Once she was able to open her mouth (lol), she explained that she had accidentally used the super glue instead because it was dark.</p>
<p>Classic mix up…</p>

<p>The 17-year-old singer (wise beyond her years, we say) posted two pictures of herself at a Sunday performance.</p>
<p>One featured a flawless face, with her signature dark lip. The below photo revealed the real Lorde, who is dealing with some skin and acne issues just like the rest of us.</p>
<p>Lorde paired the two photos with the below message for her 1.32 million followers to see:</p>
<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" lang=""en""><p>i find this curious – two photos from today, one edited so my skin is perfect and one real. remember flaws are ok&nbsp;<a href=""http://t.co/PuRhxt2u2O"">pic.twitter.com/PuRhxt2u2O</a></p>
<p>— Lorde (@lordemusic) <a href=""https://twitter.com/lordemusic/statuses/450460437998747650"">March 31, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Lorde is no stranger to real talk and speaking her mind. She’s easily identified as a feminist, and hasn’t been afraid to criticize certain celebrities (like Lana del Ray and Selena Gomez) who leave young women with less-than-inspirational messages about relationships and a woman’s worth to the guys in her life.</p>
<p>It’s great to see that Lorde isn’t all talk and no walk. Instead of simply preaching some idea of female confidence and healthy body images, she also exposes her own flaws —showing that it’s perfectly normal not to be perfect.</p>

After all, the women (and sometimes super young girls) who compete in them are often overly-skinny, and entirely too made up in caked-on makeup and a thick layer of hairspray.</p>
<p>But one contestant at Sunday’s Miss USA pageant is becoming the poster child for a seemingly healthy human body type.</p>
<p>When Miss Indiana appeared on stage for the swimsuit portion of the competition, viewers took to Twitter to show their support for 25-year-old Mekayla Diehl, who was praised for having a “normal” body and not being ridiculously thin.</p>
<p>Diehl was unfortunately eliminated after making it to the semifinals so she didn’t qualify for the top 10, but that hasn’t stopped her from becoming an Internet sensation.</p>
<p>Diehl said that she’s happy to be a positive image for the girls and women who watch the Miss USA competition each year:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">I’m OK with ‘normal.’ Whatever defines ‘normal.’ I guess it’s better than being weird.</p>
<p>Diehl has definitely helped more people expand their idea of what a beautiful (and healthy) female body looks like.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/mac-designer-collab-flower-lips-giambattista-valli/858634/,Beauty,MAC’s Latest Designer Collab Will Have Your Lips Looking Like Flowers,"<p>Shortly after announcing its&nbsp;highly anticipated <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/mac-cosmetics-latest-collaboration-definition-luxury/849613/"" target=""_blank"">collaboration with Prabal Gurung</a>, MAC revealed its&nbsp;next partnership will be with none other than designer Giambattista Valli.</p>
<p>The Italian designer’s <a href=""http://www.vogue.com/4544597/giambattista-valli-mac-cosmetics-collaboration-lipsticks/"" target=""_blank"">first foray into beauty</a> will be released in summer 2015, in conjunction with the label’s 10-year&nbsp;anniversary.</p>
<p>The five-piece lip color collection is inspired by the saturated hues of different flowers: The lightest, a pale pink, matches cherry blossoms; while the deepest is reminiscent of the skin of plums and black roses.</p>
<p>Valli explained in an interview with Vogue<em>,&nbsp;</em></p>
<blockquote><p>I’m very well known for dresses, no? And I thought it was very nice, the idea of dressing your lips.&nbsp;The best thing about makeup is that a lipstick can really change your look. If you never wear color on your lips and then one day you wear red, everyone just goes, ‘wow!’</p></blockquote>
<p>If “wow factor” was what he was going for, the Paris-based designer hit the nail on the head. The colorful palette is punchy in the best way possible. The unapologetically feminine shades (which also include a rich crimson, a peony pink and a juicy mandarin hue) are definitely not for the faint of heart — which is exactly the point.</p>
<p>Valli explained,</p>
<blockquote><p>I made these for a woman with personality, a woman who lives her life and isn’t afraid to wear color and isn’t afraid to kiss!</p></blockquote>
<p>The exact shades, inspired by flowers, were actually pulled from past collections, which&nbsp;display the designer’s love for all things floral in a more obvious manner (think cherry-blossom printed overcoats, and the petal-embellished frock Amal Clooney <a href=""http://www.vogue.com/2039765/amal-alamuddin-george-clooney-wedding/"" target=""_blank"">wore</a> for post-wedding partying).</p>
<p>The decision to collaborate with MAC came easy, as the couturier has been working with MAC backstage since his label’s inception in 2005. And it seems Valli couldn’t be more thrilled with his decision.</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<blockquote><p>For a creative person, collaborating can be frustrating because you feel that you’re limited or stuck within someone else’s ideas, but with MAC is was 100 percent freedom and 100 percent support just to make my idea become a reality, to pull out my flowers and my sense and my emotion and put it into the color.</p></blockquote>
<p>You’ll have to wait several months before getting your hands (and lips) on the figurative bouquet; in the meantime, preview the gorgeous shades and pray for a short winter.</p>Elizabeth Brockway/MAC

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/bonne-bell-lip-smackers-closing-photos/922719/,Beauty,An Ode To Our Childhoods: 12 Things We’ll Miss About Lip Smackers,"<p>As if the decline of <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/juicy-couture-sweatpant-butt/660770/"" target=""_blank"">Juicy Couture</a> and <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/humor/the-best-90s-munchies-they-need-to-bring-back/"" target=""_blank"">sugary cereals</a>&nbsp;didn’t signify it enough, our childhood is officially dead.</p>
<p>Bonne Bell, manufacturer of&nbsp;Lip Smackers (you know, the chunky, melted lip balms that defined&nbsp;middle school), is officially closing its doors.</p>
<p><em>Goodbye glorious, semi-vile flavors. Goodbye, lips that smelled better than they tasted.</em></p>
<p>The 2000s encompassed&nbsp;so many trends —&nbsp;<a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/what-every-basic-girl-loved-most-about-limited-too/664733/"" target=""_blank"">Limited Too</a>, overalls, Tiffany heart necklaces — but, above all, we had our conjoined fetish for Lip Smackers.</p>
<p>If you were a girl of the 2000 era, you were nothing without your&nbsp;Lip Smacker&nbsp;collection.</p>
<p>We were all obsessed. Lip Smackers are&nbsp;the truest monument to our preteen years, a vestibule of our middle school lives.</p>
<p>Here’s what we’ll miss about those Wild Raspberry and Watermelon flavors. As gross as they seem now,&nbsp;we really loved them back then.</p>
<h2>Digesting more than what’s absorbed on our lips.</h2>
<p>It was basically the main food group for preteens.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Trading with all our friends.</h2>
<p>I’ll give you my Wild Raspberry for your Strawberry. You have Coconut Cake? I’ll give you my Sour Apple <em>and</em>&nbsp;Cinnamon Sugar!</p>
<hr>
<h2>Deciding which flavor represents us best.</h2>
<p>Your flavor said so much about you.</p>
<p>I was definitely a Mango kind of a girl, but I still liked the girls&nbsp;who identified as Vanilla and Frozen Lemonade.</p>
<hr>
<h2>“Splurging” on a mall outing.</h2>
<p>Aka&nbsp;buying like, 13. You could never have enough pastel clothing or Smackers. Running around Claire’s, picking up choker necklaces, beaded headbands and Lip Smackers — these were simpler, happier times.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Hanging them on our jelly bracelets.</h2>
<p>They made such great accessories. The more you could squeeze onto your plastic arm jewelry, the better.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Getting the new flavor first.</h2>
<p>I remember giving girls&nbsp;side-eye if&nbsp;they&nbsp;didn’t have Tropical Punch.</p>
<p><em>Oh, you don’t have Lemon Square? That’s been out for like, four days.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>Matching our outfits to our Smackers.</h2>
<p>Bright blue Lip Smacker? Bright Blue metallic shorts. Oh, the 2000s.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Always having a sickly-sweet flavor on our tongues.</h2>
<p>Mmmm, waxy Cotton Candy.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Having more cylinder tubes than schoolbooks.</h2>
<p>Who cares if you forgot your history textbook? All that mattered was you didn’t forget your Chocolate Lip Smacker.</p>
<p>A girl has&nbsp;priorities.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The nausea from eating so much of the greasy, slickness. *<em>Shudders</em>*</h2>
<p>We spent class time&nbsp;licking it like it&nbsp;was candy. We all felt pretty damn sick by lunch, but did we stop reapplying? Hell no.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Their&nbsp;unique flavor names.</h2>
<p>Berry Peach, Salted Pretzel, Berry Slush — I could go on and on.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Never feeling like our lips were moisturized.</h2>
<p>I’m not even sure what was in a Lip Smacker, but it definitely wasn’t a formula for moisture. It was about the novelty, not the practicality.</p>
<p>RIP, Lip Smackers!</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04150909/Stocksy_txp5db5f115HgW000_Small_42916-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/brazilian-waxing-men-women/1061332/,Beauty,Women Are Paying The High Price For Men’s Love Of Brazilian Waxing,"<p>There are two truths in life : 1. Brazilian waxes are <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/things-you-should-know-before-getting-brazilian-wax/1046783/"" target=""_blank"">very painful</a>.&nbsp;2. Guys are stupid.</p>
<p>Over the course of about 20 years, these two truths began to form a unique relationship.</p>
<p>Stupid guys felt they could convince us of ripping our genital hair out. And for a while,&nbsp;it worked.</p>
<p>But, I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s start from the beginning, shall we?</p>
<p>In 1987, Jocely, Jonice, Janea, Joyce, Jussara, Juracy and Judseia Padilha opened J. Sisters Salon in Midtown Manhattan.&nbsp;Although the salon first gained notoriety for its nail services, the infamous Brazilian wax really put it on the map in 1994.</p>
<p>On the salon’s <a href=""http://jsisters.com/?page_id=16"" target=""_blank"">website,</a> Jonice reveals the purpose behind the procedure.&nbsp;She says it came about because in Brazil, “bikinis are so small,” hair removal is desirable. Completely understandable.</p>
<p>Women want to feel&nbsp;as comfortable as possible.</p>
<p>Six years later, Carrie Bradshaw brought the Brazilian wax into the living rooms of women across the country in an iconic episode of “Sex and the City.”</p>
<p>After Carrie tells her friends about her waxing adventure, <a href=""http://hellogiggles.com/did-sex-and-the-city-change-our-sexual-health/"" target=""_blank"">Miranda says</a> the reason this style is so popular in LA is because “men are too lazy to go searching for anything.”</p>
<p>Just like that, Miranda Hobbes publicly turned the Brazilian wax into something men had a say in.</p>
<p>Although Miranda will always be my least favorite “SATC” character, we can’t completely blame her for putting men in the waxing conversation.</p>
<p>Hugh Hefner and the pages of Playboy, porn in general and even Barbie all are proponents of a&nbsp;hairless vag.</p>
<p>Besides a lack of pubic hair, these three things have something else in common: the influence&nbsp;of men. Playboy magazine has a target audience of men, and the staff, headed by Editor-in-Chief Hefner, is largely male.</p>
<p>In 2011, CNBC’s Chris Morris <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/id/40910223"" target=""_blank"">dubbed</a> the adult entertainment industry a “male-dominated business.”</p>
<p>Even Barbie’s origins are with an “<a href=""http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/barbie-history1.htm"" target=""_blank"">all-male design team</a>” at Mattel.</p>
<p>But why do naked centerfolds, an unnatural-looking doll and one episode in a romantic sitcom have anything to do with how real women choose to maintain their pubic hair today?</p>
<p>How is any of this relevant in regards to a singular woman and the upkeep of her privates?</p>
<p>Not only do&nbsp;men have&nbsp;very specific guidelines and preferences when it comes to female pubic hair, but they also have a significant say on the matter.</p>
<p>Their words translate into women’s actions.</p>
<p>And since the Brazilian wax is more popular than ever, and women are willing to drop $50 or more every four-to-six weeks on the process, we know this male opinion has had some sort of influential, disturbing&nbsp;effect on the way we groom.</p>
<p>But when we go to the salon — mentally prepared for mind-numbing, stomach-wrenching pain — we aren’t thinking about the bigger picture, society’s standards or the cultural significance of choosing the Brazilian wax.</p>
<p>We just want smooth skin and hair that doesn’t peak out from our swimsuits or require shaving every&nbsp;time we take a shower.</p>
<p>The overarching male presence is powerful and sneaky, though. It knows no boundaries.</p>
<p>For example, during my first visit to get a Brazilian, my waxer looked me in the eye and said,</p>
<blockquote><p>You won’t believe how smooth you’ll be. Your boyfriend won’t be able to get his hands off you.</p></blockquote>
<p>First of all, I was annoyed. I don’t have a boyfriend (yes, Mom, I’m still single).</p>
<p>Second of all, I was disturbed.</p>
<p>Even if I did have a significant other, he wouldn’t be the one spreading his legs and having hair follicles ripped out of the most sensitive areas on his&nbsp;body, so he’d have absolutely no say in the matter.</p>
<p>I pushed her remark out of my thoughts and tried to focus on not screaming and crying for the remainder of the wax.&nbsp;After every bit of hair was removed and all the pain eventually subsided, her words rang in my head.</p>
<p>I began wondering&nbsp;how much of my personal decision to get a Brazilian wax had been consciously or subconsciously decided with the male species in mind.</p>
<p>I liked to think just I preferred to be clean-shaven.</p>
<p>And because shaving is tedious and time-consuming, a wax would be more efficient and it would last longer. It would be done strictly for me.</p>
<p>But I also had to be completely honest with myself; I knew I had an ulterior motive for both shaving and getting a Brazilian.</p>
<p>Men.</p>
<p>As embarrassing and anti-feminist as it is to admit, it’s true.</p>
<p>I’ve been wary of the male opinion on pubic hair ever since I overheard boys in my freshman dorm incessantly mock a girl for not shaving.</p>
<p>Sure, it depends on where and how you are brought up, but most girls aren’t told they need to remove their pubic hair.</p>
<p>It’s not a subject usually broached by parents or brought up in ninth grade health classes.</p>
<p>It’s often the&nbsp;sneering jeers from teenage boys and the assumption they’ll find a full bush “gross” and “unladylike” that make pubic hair taboo.</p>
<p>It’s a weird&nbsp;cycle men and women participate in every day:&nbsp;We wax, they think everyone waxes. They expect us to <em>always</em>&nbsp;be waxed, so we wax because we think they expect it.</p>
<p>Instead of assuming this was the case or inferring it from own personal experience,&nbsp;I did some relatively&nbsp;limited research among white, 20-something men.</p>
<p>Before you continue, however, I should warn you these opinions are from a very small pool, and therefore, they do not accurately reflect the norm.</p>
<p>I simply asked them what their preferences were on pubic hair and Brazilian waxes.&nbsp;Although their responses varied a bit, there was a rather alarming consensus.</p>
<p>Most of them <em>expected</em> and preferred the Brazilian wax on the women they were hooking up with.</p>
<p>With the exception of one 23-year-old, who said the expectation for absolutely no hair is “unrealistic and inappropriate,” the guys responded with rather judgmental and immature answers.</p>
<p>One of the participants informed me the Brazilian wax was “just a thing people did,” you know, like brushing their teeth or going&nbsp;to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Another 22-year-old even went so far as to say he would not go down on a girl if she kept her pubic hair, but he would <em>still</em>&nbsp;expect her to give him a blowjob.</p>
<p>If that isn’t f*cked up and misogynistic, I don’t know what is.</p>
<p>The worst answer, however, ran along the lines of,</p>
<blockquote><p>Hair down there is gross. If I’m gonna go down there, I don’t want to be flossing my teeth.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can’t make that sh*t up.</p>
<p>Throughout my poll, I tried to remain impartial and unbiased. Somewhere or someone — maybe even a woman — taught&nbsp;them female pubic hair was bad. These guys, just like women, weren’t born with a deep-seeded aversion to pubes.</p>
<p>They were simply playing their parts in the cycle.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, what are we going to do about it? How do we prevent our little girls and younger sisters from believing a Brazilian wax is necessary to attract men?</p>
<p>Given the current environment, one filled with waxing salons and men who think porn is real, there are two probable solutions to putting an end to expectations on hair down there:</p>
<p>1. Every single woman vows&nbsp;to stop seeking&nbsp;Brazilian waxes; and 2. We stop taking the male opinion on our pubic hair into consideration.</p>
<p>Although the Brazilian wax&nbsp;is basically weird&nbsp;and unusual torture, Option 1 seems highly&nbsp;unlikely. Especially if a woman personally enjoys hers groomed, shampooed and styled.</p>
<p>So we’re left with Option 2; we allow our personal preferences to take the reigns.</p>
<p>If you like to look down and never see a speck of hair, you go to a&nbsp;salon every month, hand over your credit card and pray to God it won’t be as painful as it was last time.</p>
<p>And if you also happen to find yourself in bed with a man who’s into the style, so be it.</p>
<p>If your pubic hair makes you feel womanly and sexual, free the bush and don’t let any man tell you otherwise. If he questions your choice, you don’t need him in your life. He’s stupid.</p>
<p>Because f*ck guys who think they have any kind of relevant opinion on pubic hair.</p>
<p>Or don’t. They can watch porn instead.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/waxing_elitedaily-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/dont-hate-theyre-beautifulthey-hate/,Beauty,"Don’t Hate Them Because They’re Beautiful, They Already Hate Themselves","<p><strong>Since I’ve been modeling for 10+ years, I am considered a veteran in the industry. I have worked with some of the most talented designers, photographers, stylists and, of course, some of the most beautiful women in the world.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Many people, particularly women, are very interested in my job.&nbsp; “You’re so lucky,” they tell me,&nbsp; “You must love what you do.”&nbsp; “I wish I could take pictures all day and get paid,” etc.</p>
<p>I don’t want to sound like an ungrateful brat, because I know how fortunate I am to have the opportunities I have. Very few people in the world get to experience the things I do.&nbsp;Very few people have the necessary proportions, body type, attitude, look, etc.&nbsp; So what’s my problem? My problem is that my job is not to be smart, hard working or dedicated.&nbsp; My job is to be pretty.</p>
<p>So why then, when I am paid to be “beautiful,” am I dealing with insecurity?&nbsp;Shouldn’t I be the most confident person for miles? I plan to explain why some of the most exceptionally beautiful women in the world also happen to be some of the most insecure.</p>
<p>Now before I really delve into this topic, I want to begin by saying that I am in no way implying that ALL models are insecure or deal with issues of self-worth. In fact, I happen to know a number of very confident, intelligent, self-assured women in this industry, so I feel the need to point out that this is not inclusive of all models by any means.</p>
<p>However, I can honestly say that I believe this applies to a majority of women working as models, and even beautiful women in general. You might wonder: how can someone who is in the pages of magazines wearing designer clothing, walking runways, dating millionaires and rubbing elbows with celebrities be insecure? Well, there are a number of factors at play that contribute to this issue.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have met some of the most stunningly gorgeous women one could ever imagine. It’s hard to picture these women ever feeling anything other than self-assured and confident. But on the contrary, the one characteristic that many of them share, besides being exceptionally beautiful, is that they have major self-esteem issues.</p>
<p>Modeling is a job that for most has an expiration date.&nbsp; There are only a handful of years a young woman can model before she has to be put out to pasture.</p>
<p>There is a constant fear, an ever-present awareness that time is ticking and the clock can’t be turned back.&nbsp; This puts an unbelievable amount of pressure on models. Success in modeling is not measured by how hard you work; often times it’s just dumb luck — a combination of looks, timing and connections.</p>
<p>One of the most frustrating realizations to face as a model is that you have little to no control over your success or lack of success.&nbsp; No amount of dedication, ambition or “hard work” is going to help you reach that coveted supermodel status.</p>
<p>As a model, you are in constant competition with other models, so comparing yourself to them is unavoidable.&nbsp; You wonder why certain girls are booked for jobs and you’re not. You begin to wonder if they are prettier than you and if they’re more worthy.</p>
<p>And that feeling never really goes away because there is an endless conveyer belt of models.&nbsp;Younger girls get churned out every day. The aging models get pushed aside year-by-year. Clients stop booking them. There is no loyalty in this business. Even a slight weight gain could result in losing clients and even getting dropped from your agency.</p>
<p>When you can’t trust anyone or count on anyone — when you are judged solely on your appearance every single day, it begins to consume you.&nbsp;You become obsessed, and the constant rejection definitely doesn’t help matters.</p>
<p>Regardless of how many compliments models receive from men AND women, for some reason the good things are harder to remember.&nbsp; It’s the “You need to lose five lbs.” and the –“Your hips are too big” — “You aren’t tall enough”– “You’re TOO tall” that are the hardest to forget comments. Is it any wonder why so many models have eating disorders?</p>
<p>It is because this industry sucks away every and any positive feeling a young woman has about herself.&nbsp;That is why so many girls become victims. Victims of drugs, sex, body issues.&nbsp;How can you be happy with yourself when all you hear is criticism? When all you feel is rejection?&nbsp; How can you trust anyone when they are ready to step on your back if needed?</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the biggest reasons beautiful women are so insecure is because men constantly use them as trophies. There is the constant question of whether he is interested in the person inside, or the package it comes in.</p>
<p>It is really a vicious cycle because unfortunately, when a woman is feeling insecure, she seeks validation — often in the wrong places. Many men in New York are familiar with this, and know how to play it to their advantage.&nbsp;I know certain men that go through models like mints.</p>
<p>They spew out false promises and provide a false sense of security until they reach their ultimate goal, which is usually sex. When they’ve gotten that, it’s on to the next. The really smart ones prey on insecurities.</p>
<p>They might act cold or distant; they might flirt with others and comment about how hot another girl is, all because they know it will only make their target hungrier for their acceptance.</p>
<p>These men are predators who prey on women by perpetuating their negative feelings of low self-worth. Again, this is not inclusive of ALL men but it is a very common occurrence, particularly in the scene-y crowds of New York City.</p>
<p>If you are a model in New York, you likely do not have a real support system.&nbsp; You have no family close by; your closest friends are not around, so naturally you form relationships with people you meet in your environment, namely other models. These relationships are often not genuine, but those of convenience or necessity.</p>
<p>Speaking from personal experience, I can honestly say that while not impossible, it is extremely difficult for models to be true friends to one another. They are in constant competition with each other — for jobs, for men, for attention.</p>
<p>There is no trust between them; the cliques they form are infested by gossip, sabotage and resentment. Attention seeking is a common, extremely frustrating and annoying habit that some models resort to in order to get the validation they so desperately seek.</p>
<p>I think there is a complete contradiction in the way society views modeling.&nbsp;On one hand it is perceived to be a glamorous, exciting and sexy world. People often idolize models and put them up on pedestals.</p>
<p>But on the other hand most people automatically assume that if you are a model, you are stupid and have nothing important to say. I have encountered so many pretentious, condescending people (both men and women) who look down on me as if I am doing something shameful or ridiculous.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s just <em>their</em> insecurity, I can’t be sure. But whether it be bad or good, people inevitably have an opinion about me before I even open my mouth and that is perhaps the worst thing of all.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I am proud of my accomplishments and I am so grateful that I have been able to experience all the things I have. I would not be able to write this article today without them.&nbsp;But I also don’t want those things to define me. So when I’m gone, what are people going to remember about me?</p>
<p>That I got to pose for Maxim a few times? That I got to walk down a few dozen runways? No. Not if I can help it. I want to be remembered for something more. Something significant. Even if I don’t know what that something is yet, it’s ok…because at least I have the good sense to know that there is more to life than the way I look.</p>
<p>So I suppose that makes me one of the lucky ones. Because the sad truth is, there are heaps of women out there who will probably never come to that realization.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/pondering-plastic-surgery-korean-american-perspective/599842/,Beauty,The Plastic Surgery Phenomenon: How I See It From A Korean-American Perspective,"<p>Growing up, my heroes mostly advocated for the brand of feminist theory that burned bras, banished blush and rejected the idea of primping to become more marketable “commodities.”</p>
<p>As such, I grew up surrounded by inspirational, powerful women who proudly embraced the au natural and nippy nipple syndrome. I was taught to not care about what anyone else said or thought because I was supposed to be proud.</p>
<p>One woman I really look up to is my grandmother, who plowed through a sexist society that was dead-set against her becoming a successful pharmacist.</p>
<p>She’s an inspiration I’ve crafted too many elementary school projects around. She still runs the pharmacy, pays for a good portion of my tuition and somehow, can still fit in a hundred crunches during her lunch break.</p>
<p>I was taken aback when my mother told me that my grandmother offered to pay for elective eyelid surgery for my impending visit to Seoul.</p>
<p>I understand that it’s considered to be a rite of passage for many Koreans, but it also forced me to ask myself, “Do I really count as one?”</p>
<p>Maybe externally, but I’ve never really considered myself to be Korean. I don’t speak the language, my food knowledge is limited to the most basic of bibimbaps, and the only time I listen to K-pop is if it’s part of a James Brooks-assembled mixed tape.</p>
<p>I understood the offer as a gesture of love and for that, I was incredibly grateful. But, another part of me couldn’t help but feel insecure by the suggestion that I should alter myself to be more appealing “wifey material.”</p>
<p>Was my mug not cute enough to send around on Christmas cards and proudly show off on wallet-sized photographs?</p>
<p>My inner feminist, bred on a Bay-Area brand of barefaced beauty, didn’t know how to react. What did this mean for me — a Korean-American who was born and raised in a predominantly white, upper-middle-class suburb — as a woman? How would my decision to do it or not do it affect my self-perception?</p>
<p>For a good month, cheesy, inane questions like, “Which identity do I choose?” rambled through my head and I spent way too much time Googling before and after pictures, cringing at swollen lids and purple shadows. I stalked my university’s Korean-American Student Association group to see how obvious surgery was — whether or not people would be able to tell.</p>
<p>Plastic surgery is inescapable in South Korea. Many girls get nose jobs and jaw augmentations as graduation presents, meaning many button noses and moon-shaped faces disappear in favor of a very distinct look.</p>
<p>It’s a look that adheres more to the standard set of aesthetic principles that my mentors battled for decades. Deep down, what girl doesn’t want to be considered pretty?</p>
<p>Why couldn’t I adhere to the third-wave theory and draw power from the subconscious confidence obtained from being attractive? Maybe it was all just further proof of my deep insecurities (cue years of deep-seeded image issues and self-doubt).</p>
<p>I’m more comfortable in my appearance now than when I was younger, but I still grapple with my image and with the idea of what a feminist is.</p>
<p>I continue to hide under layers of my signature cat-like eyeliner and reserve my bare face for my closest confidantes. At the same time, however, I subscribe to the belief that whatever makes you feel powerful and unstoppable — whether it’s blood-red lipstick or fishnet tights — can also be proud parts of one’s identity.</p>
<p>While I still don’t have real answers to my musings, I have come to the concrete decision to never surgically alter my eyes.</p>
<p>I’d be lying if I said I was completely confident about the extra layer of adipose that covers my lids, but I think I’m a catch in other ways, unrelated to the way my eyes squint and my eyelashes don’t curl upwards.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t feel the need to be defined by who finds me attractive and who doesn’t, but realistically, who doesn’t occasionally let that thought slip into mind?</p>
<p>It’s the kind of deep-rooted, biological anxiety that always slinks in the back of any social interaction, and while it may be an uneasy compromise, it does seem to be working for now.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/hello-gorgeous-four-resolutions-step-beauty-game-2015/895663/,Beauty,"Hello, Gorgeous: 4 Ways To Step Up Your Beauty Game In 2015","<p>If you’re like most people out there, you’re probably sick of making New Year’s resolutions that either don’t last or are full of clichés. Gym memberships? Meh. More salads? Ugh.</p>
<p>The biggest mistake&nbsp;most people make is setting&nbsp;goals for themselves that create too much stress. Working out more is beneficial&nbsp;in theory, but when you make a resolution to hit the gym every day before 6 am, you’re setting yourself up for failure and disappointment.</p>
<p>New Year’s resolutions should be a little self-absorbed and definitely focused on making you feel good. It’s also not a bad idea to push yourself to step outside your comfort zone. A little inner challenge never hurt anyone.</p>
<p>Here’s another secret: Sometimes, the key to a fresh start is simply <em>feeling</em> fresh. By giving yourself an outward boost, you’re setting the tone for a brand new chapter.</p>
<p>Instead of worrying about eating a salad every day of the week or eliminating carbs, cut yourself a little slack and select moderation with a side of Sephora. Try your hand at some beauty resolutions this year; start January off with a fresh ‘do or some new products.</p>
<p>Here are five fabulous glamour moves&nbsp;to try in 2015. Don’t hesitate to wink at yourself in the mirror afterward.</p>
<h2>1. Learn once and for all the difference between BB cream and CC cream, and then commit.</h2>
<p><a href=""http://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g1882/beauty-breakdown-creams/"" target=""_blank"">The Quick Skinny</a>: BB cream is like a power team for your face; it acts as a primer, moisturizer and foundation all at once.</p>
<p>The “CC” in CC cream stands for color corrective, and adds ingredients that will balance out your skin tone, in addition to working as a foundation, moisturizer, sunscreen and primer. CC cream is great for ladies who have a bit of red in their cheeks, or who would like to smooth out any uneven spots.</p>
<p>It’s a lot to take in, and now there’s also a DD cream (which stands for “dermatologically defining” or “daily defense,”&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.popsugar.com/beauty/What-DD-Cream-31375427"" target=""_blank"">depending upon who you ask</a>).</p>
<p>If you haven’t tried any of these products yet, you’re in for an eye-opening experience. You will definitely notice a dramatic difference in your skin’s appearance with the help of one of these creams, and you’ll appreciate the glow that comes with the application.</p>
<p>If you’ve got some cash to spend, try <a href=""http://www.sephora.com/diorskin-nude-bb-creme-P377753"" target=""_blank"">Diorskin Nude BB creme</a>, found at any Sephora. If you’re on a budget, check out Maybelline’s “Wonder Bright” CC cream, which you can find at most drug stores.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. Steady your hand and perfect&nbsp;the cat eye</h2>
<p>Black eyeliner will never go out of style; it’s basically a beauty law. The look has been solidified in fashion stone by celebs like <a href=""http://www.dailymakeover.com/trends/makeup/10-best-celebrity-cat-eyes/#slide1"" target=""_blank"">Angelina Jolie</a> and <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/28/cat-eye-liner-celebrity-inspiration_n_3823325.html"" target=""_blank"">Sophia Loren</a>, and is perfect for any night out.</p>
<p>The look is best obtained with the use of liquid liner, which obviously requires your hands to be as still as a statue. For an inexpensive standard liquid liner pen, try the <a href=""http://www.sephora.com/long-lasting-eye-liner-P279639?skuId=1296151"" target=""_blank"">Sephora Collection Long Lasting Eyeliner</a>.</p>
<p>If you need a little help, try&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.sephora.com/theyre-real-push-up-liner-P386915?skuId=1626753"" target=""_blank"">Benefit’s</a> They’re Real! Push Up Liner. This liner comes in the form of a tipped pen, which is easier to manage than a brush.</p>
<p>If that still won’t cut it, try a cream-based eyeliner in a pot, like&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.sephora.com/eye-paint-P383116?skuId=1524891"" target=""_blank"">Eye Paint</a>&nbsp;by Nars. With this type of liner, you simply dip a brush into the cream and then connect dots close to your lash line. This method is great for gals who struggle with liquid liner, but still want the sexy feline look.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Go “red lip classic”</h2>
<p>As <a href=""http://instagram.com/taylorswift"" target=""_blank"">T-Swift</a> knows, red lips will always be cool. If you’ve been fearful of trying this color, now is your chance to break out of your lipstick comfort zone and embrace the rosy hue.</p>
<p>One of the best things about red lipstick is that it requires minimal effort on the rest of your face. You don’t want to pair ruby lips with smoky eyes (hello, overdone!), so all you need is a touch of mascara and you’re good to go. Donning the red lips look is a great way to quickly look amazing.</p>
<p>Carrie Bradshaw would probably agree that Chanel is the way to go here, so if you’ve got the cash to spend, invest in <a href=""http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/chanel-rouge-allure-velvet-luminous-matte-lip-colour/3244589"" target=""_blank"">Chanel Rouge Allure Velvet</a>.</p>
<p>Other honorable mentions:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.sephora.com/vib-rouge-creme-lipstick-P381813?skuId=1556208"" target=""_blank"">Bite Beauty</a> VIP Rouge Lipstick and <a href=""http://www.sephora.com/audacious-lipstick-P387906?skuId=1637180"" target=""_blank"">NARS Audacious Lipstick</a></p>
<p>If you’re not willing to splurge just yet, check out your drugstore’s supply of <a href=""http://www.revlon.com/products/lips/lip-color/moon-drops-lipstick"" target=""_blank"">Revlon Moon Drops</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Get those eyebrows on fleek</h2>
<p><a href=""http://instagram.com/caradelevingne"" target=""_blank"">Cara Delevingne</a> is the perfect example of brow envy. If you’re&nbsp;yearning&nbsp;for tailored brows, do some research, find a good salon and indulge in a threading appointment. Your brows will thank you.</p>
<p>If you’re of the “over-plucked in high school” camp, you are not alone. Many of us went tweezer-happy in 10th grade and are suffering the&nbsp;consequences. In that case, invest in a good brow kit to help darken those babies and fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>Sephora sells a great mini kit called the <a href=""http://www.sephora.com/eyebrow-editor-complete-brow-kit-P374551?skuId=1425271"" target=""_blank"">Eyebrow Editor</a>. It comes with pressed powder, an angle brush, setting brow wax, a spoolie brush and a mini tweezer. It is the perfect quick-fix for sad brows.</p>
<p>If you feel like splurging a little more, check out <a href=""http://www.sephora.com/brow-envy-brow-shaping-defining-kit-P279509?skuId=1604024"" target=""_blank"">Too Faced’s Brow Envy</a> kit. Even if your teenage self didn’t anticipate the brow revolution that is currently sweeping fashion, you can still remedy whatever damage has been done with the help of some friends.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151219/Stocksy_txp339a118awjW000_Small_574871-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/interview-drag-queens-teach-women-beauty-photos/1009133/,Beauty,On Fake Lashes And Wigs: What Drag Queens Can Teach Women About Beauty,"<p>Beauty&nbsp;done well is practically an art form.&nbsp;If skillful makeup artists&nbsp;are the Vincent Van Goghs of the cosmetic world — classic and refined — drag queens would be the eccentric, splashy, rule-challenging Warhols.</p>
<p>Somewhere between convincing individual false eyelashes to stay put&nbsp;on&nbsp;your lash line&nbsp;and sticking a piece of tape to your eye to draw sharp cat eyes, there’s a drag queen who’s done it before — bolder and better.</p>
<p>Drag is everywhere; you just have to look for it.</p>
<p>The glamorous practice&nbsp;of men creating larger-than-life female characters and cross-dressing to fit the part is responsible for many of the trends women enjoy today — and if those contoured faces and bold eyebrows seem familiar, it’s because you’ve probably seen them on drag queens first.</p>
<p>Under the loud wigs and just above the glittering costumes lies an impeccable dedication to finding the the right shade of lipstick and drawing on precisely-angled eyebrows.</p>
<p>Anyone who’s ever viewed “RuPaul’s Drag Race” or attended a drag show can attest to that.</p>
<p>Many of us struggle to daub on lip stain correctly, let alone create an entirely new face. But for many drag queens, their iconic looks are a result of constant adaptation.</p>
<p>Elite Daily spoke to Wigstock founder <a href=""http://www.ladybunny.net/"" target=""_blank"">Lady Bunny</a> and “the Queen of Green,” <a href=""http://heddalettuce.com/"" target=""_blank"">Hedda Lettuce</a>, about their beauty routines, asking what it takes to be a woman in the complicated world of cosmetics.</p>
<h2>You don’t need to buy the most expensive product.</h2>
<p>Sure, Sephora’s Beauty Insider program gives excellent bonuses, but sometimes spending $50 on one product just isn’t worthwhile.</p>
<p>Lady Bunny – née Jon Ingle – always checks the drugstore first, relying on staple products like Maybelline’s liquid eyeliner and Revlon lipstick, which she’s purchased for 25 years. Anything else has to come from professional makeup supplier Alcone.</p>
<p>Hedda Lettuce, otherwise known as actor Steven Polito, is quick to back the importance of budget purchases.</p>
<p>She said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Mixing cheap with the expensive basically describes my entire look.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Trendy colors are for people who don’t know their own skin.</h2>
<p>Both queens shared horror stories of their early days on the drag scene – the mid-90s for Hedda Lettuce and early 80s in Lady Bunny’s case. As it turns out, the colors popular in cosmetics aren’t always suited to your exact face.</p>
<p>And it isn’t just a man-posing-as-a-woman’s problem; it’s a woman’s plight, too. Remember the time your bronzer made you more orange than a prison jumpsuit? Yeah, we’ve all been there, and&nbsp;it’s oddly comforting knowing men struggle, too.</p>
<p>Lady Bunny remembers being struck by the way thin lips and dark colors made her look more like a “razor-lipped snapping turtle” than a diva. Instead, she sticks to coral shades and liquid eyeliner, naming the 1960s as a key inspiration.</p>
<p>Hedda Lettuce, too, felt the pull of color in her routine. In this case, it was the iconic green wig that brought her character together. She says she can’t even imagine performing without verdant hair at this point.</p>
<p>Moral of the story? If you’re going to go there —&nbsp;go&nbsp;<em>all the way</em> and own it. No regrets.</p>
<hr>
<h2>A perfect face takes years of practice.</h2>
<p>Ever wanted to perfect contouring or eyeshadow application and found it’s too time-consuming to be practical?</p>
<p>The good news is this&nbsp;stage only lasts until you <em>really</em> get the technique down. Bad news? You’ll likely spend a ton of time getting there.</p>
<p>Hedda Lettuce’s look, for example, once took her about two hours. Two decades later, she’s got it down to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Lady Bunny’s face only takes 25 minutes to put together, but she added that she’s “never been that great with makeup.”</p>
<p>Lady Bunny said,</p>
<blockquote><p>If it’s for a photo or video shoot I’ll spend more time to try and perfect it, but I’m never going to be one of those fussy people who blends and blends for hours with graduating colors of shadow.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fair enough, especially for someone who’s already tasked with creating a woman’s face out of a man’s.</p>
<hr>
<h2>If you’re only putting on one product, make it lip gloss.</h2>
<p>Yeah, we know:&nbsp;<em>Every&nbsp;</em>article you read these days promises to simplify your morning routine and touts the “<em>only</em> must-use product” you need to grab before you rush out the door.</p>
<p>But if you’re late to work and there’s only one item to grab, both queens swear by tinted lip glosses.&nbsp;(Bet you weren’t expecting that advice, huh?)</p>
<p>Lady Bunny relies on warm shades, which create the illusion of white teeth while making you look easily put together.</p>
<p>More time than you realized?</p>
<p>In this case, both&nbsp;queens will reach for a pair of false lashes to open up their features. In your case, a mascara wand will do the trick.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151357/Stocksy_txpcb63ecd13rW000_Small_674157-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/beautyblender-tips-cosmetics-foundation/1105227/,Beauty,This Cult-Status $20 Sponge Does More Than Just Apply Foundation,"<p>There’s a single fix for streaky foundation lines, dry skin and overdone blush. It’s squishy, pink, kind of looks like a pocket vibrator and costs $20 — it’s also <a href=""http://www.beautyblender.com/shop/category/sponges/beautyblender-original-single.html"" target=""_blank"">just a sponge</a>.</p>
<p>Since its creation <a href=""http://www.beautyblender.com/behind-the-blend"" target=""_blank"">in 2003</a>, the conical cosmetic sponge named Beautyblender has been the weapon of choice in&nbsp;the beauty community. The tool, designed by Hollywood makeup artist Rea Ann Silva, aids in seamless makeup application thanks to its acorn shape, lack of sides and unique formulation. Even today, it earns nearly universal five-star reviews.</p>
<p>Many use the expensive tool to apply foundation, but it’s so much more than a one-trick pony. After soaking the sponge and squeezing it until barely damp (this step is key!), scroll down for&nbsp;high-level&nbsp;hacks that’ll make the Beautyblender the most valuable tool in your arsenal.</p>

<h2>Layer on moisturizer without ever touching your face.</h2>
<p>A tip provided by Beautyblender’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVR3tqNyKL4"" target=""_blank"">very own channel</a> has fans thinking of the spongy tool in an entirely new light: It’s not just for makeup, but skincare as well.</p>
<p>Whether you’re using a light serum or a priming moisturizer, try applying it with a damp Beautyblender. Instead of uneven coverage, the product will fill in pores and start your beauty routine off with a smooth&nbsp;canvas.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Save flaky, dry skin.</h2>
<p>Beauty devotees know the only thing that’s tougher on skin than exfoliant&nbsp;is the constant application of heavy makeup. Brushes, sponges and new products can leave facial skin peeling and dry around the nose and lips.</p>
<p>Traditional brushes layer product over dry areas, resulting in a not-so-great pancake face that’s flattering to no one. MonsiieurAlex <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJzuKHEVQlI"" target=""_blank"">recommends</a> using Beautyblender’s finely pointed tip to pat the product into the corners of your nose without irritating the skin any further.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Avoid unwanted foundation lines.</h2>
<p>Full-coverage foundation can feel tedious to apply because it weighs on the skin and spreads unevenly. YouTube beauty experts recommend Beautyblender as a way to avoid the mess and ensure light overall coverage.</p>
<p>To take advantage of the tool’s round surface,&nbsp;CoffeeBreakwithDani&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrOUN_XjlnQ"" target=""_blank"">advocates</a> using Beautyblender to lightly smooth foundation across the whole face before stippling the product into skin.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Contour like a professional.</h2>
<p>Blame the Kardashians for the popularization of contouring, a cosmetic technique that proves there are temporary fixes more challenging than plastic surgery.</p>
<p>YouTube’s Kandee Johnson <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RgBfSrwNAI"" target=""_blank"">recommends</a> using the Beautyblender to smooth out lines between the light and dark portions of the face, beginning by evenly blending highlighted areas into the bronzer surrounding them.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Apply blush without looking like a clown.</h2>
<p>If you’re scared of accidentally looking more “It” than “It Girl” when&nbsp;trying out a bright pop of color, rely on the Beautyblender for its crisis-neutralizing powers.</p>
<p>Because the tool excels at thinning out product, it’s the ideal choice for remedying a thick application of rosy pink powder. Using&nbsp;the Beautyblender on&nbsp;the problem area, the color will fade to an even subtle wash, a tip <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXAIjGVhemM"" target=""_blank"">provided by</a> BodyInZone.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Reshape trouble areas with Beautyblender’s micro.mini.</h2>
<p>The most enjoyable part of makeup application is the chance to highlight your favorite areas — think: eyes and eyebrows — while disguising the nose you dislike so much.</p>
<p>Huda Kattan <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fYxyRSYpfo"" target=""_blank"">stands by</a> Beautyblender’s oft-forgotten younger sibling, the smaller-sized micro.mini, for precise contouring. Its tiny point is perfect for the area around the nostrils, as well as applying a thin line of highlighter to the bridge of the nose.</p>
<hr>
<h2>While you’re at it, fix those eyebrows.</h2>
<p>There are enough crises in the average day without adding “makeup stuck in eyebrow hairs” to the list. This tip from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wgrFxPmSXY"" target=""_blank"">Morgan Joyce</a> will end those days immediately.</p>
<p>Instead of over-applying to even out every spot around the brows, let your foundation fade out a centimeter or so from the brows. Then, use the micro.mini to blend precisely around the brows.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Powder the perfect amount.</h2>
<p>Overdoing the loose powder is a condition that affects us all, making our friends wonder what exactly went on in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Instead of using a packaged puff or brush, add the powder to the round end of your Beautyblender and apply to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RgBfSrwNAI"" target=""_blank"">set your makeup</a>.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BeautyBlender-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/perfect-concealer-pimple/1106489/,Beauty,Here Is The Perfect Concealer For Every Pimple Life Throws Your Way,"<p>The unexpected appearance of a pimple is much like that of a co-worker you can’t stand. She drops by your desk for an impromptu chat about Mason jars and her Pinterest boards – and it’s nearly impossible to get her to leave.</p>
<p>You want to be sympathetic to her, but you just don’t have the patience. Instead, you keep it simple by not offering&nbsp;any follow-up questions and then conveniently announce that you’re buried beneath a never ending pile of work.</p>
<p>In the same way, you can plan to cope with pimples. The rude, always ill-timed red mounds ruin your complexion and mean half an hour spent in front of the mirror trying to find a strategy for getting rid of them.</p>
<p>There’s no easy fix for an omnipresent coworker, but luckily the solution to a pimple is as simple&nbsp;as a trip to a makeup specialty store. No matter how unfortunate the blemish, we’ve got a cover-up.</p>
<p>Here are the best concealer matches for every pimple life throws your way.</p>
<h2>The Whitehead-Turned-Scab Your Boyfriend Tried Unsuccessfully To Pop</h2>
<p>There is no struggle like trying to cover up a scab with makeup. Layering concealer or powder over the flaky, textured area makes it a focal point, when all you’re trying to do is pretend the spot doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>To remedy the situation, begin moisturizing immediately to&nbsp;rid yourself of the peeling skin flakes for good. Respect the scab instead of trying to peel it off (which will only prolong the misery). Then stock up on a creamy concealer to cover the red spot without creating a mess.</p>

<hr>
<h2>The Lurking Red Spot That Might Turn Into A Pimple</h2>
<p>One day, your skin is&nbsp;a perfect canvas. By the next, you begin to notice a dull ache somewhere around your forehead. The worst part of a clogged pore sitting far below the surface of the skin is that it takes several days to rise up. When it does, that’s an entirely separate battle.</p>
<p>For now, just focus on the problem at hand: a splotchy redness that’s difficult to cover up. Tackle the problem with <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/concealer-actually-matches-your-skin/1075761/"" target=""_blank"">careful use</a> of a green-tinted concealer designed to counteract the red, dabbing it on with a small brush. Let the color set for several minutes before continuing with your regular makeup application, including regular concealer and foundation.</p>

<h2>The Cystic Acne You Don’t Want Your Mom To Notice</h2>
<p>Moms have an eye for detail; regrettably, usually&nbsp;about the things you’d rather her not notice. When it comes to a cystic breakout that’s already making you self-conscious, your mom’s dermatologist recommendations and homemade skin treatments can feel like overkill. Instead of dishing on your skin’s condition, hide it throughout your weekly family dinner.</p>
<p>To cover up the breakout, call in concealer with serious oomph to provide a layer of color that sits over the acne without drying it out. Make sure to let it set several minutes, and stipple with a light layer of loose powder for longevity. By dessert, you’ll still be looking good.</p>

<h2>The Pimple Developing While You’re At Work</h2>
<p>You’re at the office, trying to be a #GirlBoss, but your skin isn’t cooperating. The splotch that seemed minuscule during morning makeup application has suddenly doubled in size. By lunch, it might be a full-on whitehead.</p>
<p>Resist the urge to poke and prod (we know, it’s the most challenging thing you’ll do all day), and reach into your bag for emergency reinforcements. Use a concealer that has the added benefit of drying ingredients to begin treating the pimple while making sure it’s not obvious.</p>

<h2>The Bumps That Might Be Pimples … But You’re Not Sure</h2>
<p>With the weather constantly shifting&nbsp;and skin that seems to have a mind of its own, it’s challenging to keep track of every minor irritation that comes your way. If you’ve noticed slightly problematic spots but aren’t too concerned about developing a serious acne problem, rely on&nbsp;an all-in-one product.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/rid-frizzy-hair/,Beauty,Get Rid Of Your Frizzy Hair,"<p>With transitional weather comes frizzy hair. Humidity increasing and temperatures changing causes the most irritating locks of the year. Start taking preventative measures to prep and protect your hair from these issues.</p>
<p>The first and most crucial step to eliminating frizzy hair starts in the shower. Your hair must be well conditioned in order to fight off the frizz. Don’t neglect your conditioner and try switching over to a conditioner specialized for straight hair for some extra help.</p>
<p>Although conditioning your hair is important, always washing it can cause your hair to dry out, which in turn leads to more frizz. Minimize your washes as much as you can. Purchase a dry shampoo, and leave in conditioner.</p>
<p>On the days that you do wash your hair, apply a smoothing cream before styling your hair. Brush your hair out with a wide paddle brush, which will help your hair appear smoother.</p>
<p>Finish your styling with an anti-frizz serum to lock in all of that moisture and shine. Now your hair is prepped, and frizz free, and you’re ready to go.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/concealer-actually-matches-your-skin/1075761/,Beauty,Here’s How To Finally Find A Damn Concealer Made For Your Skin Color,"<p>The mortal enemy of most women isn’t an obnoxious boss or rude friend; it’s something much closer to home: the bluish circles under the eyes and the splotchy red blemishes that emerge overnight.</p>
<p>No matter how much yellow-tinged concealer you cake on top of the problem areas, it never seems to accomplish anything more than making you look like a heavily-spackled Donatella Versace on an off day.</p>
<p>Here’s a bit of tough love: You’re probably using concealer incorrectly.</p>
<p>And for good reason: Concealer is the one product that’s difficult to get right on your own. Here’s the step-by-step, makeup-artist-endorsed guide to applying concealer and finding the best-matched shade.</p>
<h2>Admit your makeup weaknesses.</h2>
<figure><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://elitedaily.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/1x1-clear.png"" data-lazy-src=""http://mojo-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/a1e97-britney-confused.gif"" data-lazy-backup=""http://mojo-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/a1e97-britney-confused.gif"" alt="""" height=""281"" width=""500""><noscript><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://mojo-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/a1e97-britney-confused.gif"" alt="""" height=""281"" width=""500""></noscript></figure>
<p>Whether it’s a whitehead that’s sprung up or a patch of rosacea that won’t quit, the right shade and technique is important.</p>
<p>For guidance on the most stubborn product sold on any beauty aisle, we consulted <a href=""http://www.rougeny.com/"" target=""_blank"">Rouge New York</a>’s Rebecca Perkins, former makeup department head for “Law &amp; Order: SVU,” who began her own studio in partnership with&nbsp;actress Stephanie March.</p>
<p>In more than ten years in the cosmetics business, Perkins has covered nearly every blemish imaginable.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Tap a professional to choose your shade.</h2>
<figure><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://elitedaily.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/1x1-clear.png"" data-lazy-src=""https://theotherhubby.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/tumblr_mswioc9tde1s2wsdzo1_500.gif"" data-lazy-backup=""https://theotherhubby.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/tumblr_mswioc9tde1s2wsdzo1_500.gif"" alt="""" height=""213"" width=""500""><noscript><img class=""alignnone"" src=""https://theotherhubby.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/tumblr_mswioc9tde1s2wsdzo1_500.gif"" alt="""" height=""213"" width=""500""></noscript></figure>
<p>The first rule of concealer, according to Perkins, is never bringing in an amateur to do a professional’s job. In this case, it’s choosing the perfect color for all your facial&nbsp;marks.</p>
<p>To pick a shade, visit a professional makeup counter in either a boutique, like Sephora, or a department store. It’s not just a well-trained eye you need to make a color judgement, but proper lighting as well.</p>
<p>As Perkins puts it,</p>
<blockquote><p>Having someone [whose] job it is to find you the perfect product is the best tool around.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Nix the rainbow-hued concealers, please.</h2>
<figure><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://elitedaily.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/1x1-clear.png"" data-lazy-src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eMaQLk-dHus/Ump8wrMg2II/AAAAAAAAB8U/yQboYxdcjTY/s1600/chelsea-judges-you.gif"" data-lazy-backup=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eMaQLk-dHus/Ump8wrMg2II/AAAAAAAAB8U/yQboYxdcjTY/s1600/chelsea-judges-you.gif"" alt="""" height=""250"" width=""500""><noscript><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eMaQLk-dHus/Ump8wrMg2II/AAAAAAAAB8U/yQboYxdcjTY/s1600/chelsea-judges-you.gif"" alt="""" height=""250"" width=""500""></noscript></figure>
<p>At the very end of the concealer aisle lurks a few odd characters, including ochre and minty green-colored tubes.</p>
<p>In theory, these shades are meant to color-correct pimples and dark circles by canceling them out. During morning beauty routines, however, some combination of unnatural lighting and pre-coffee exhaustion often results in green-and-yellow circles across your face.</p>
<p>According to Perkins, color correction is a theory better saved for tattoo coverage than the average pimple.</p>
<p>However, don’t disregard yellow altogether. Beauty guru Bobbi Brown <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/makeup-101-bobbi-browns-tips-choosing-concealer/story?id=30380407"" target=""_blank"">recommends</a> searching for a neutral shade with a hint of yellow, rather than pink, to reflect skin’s natural undertones.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Opt for a brand with tons of choices.</h2>
<figure><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://elitedaily.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/1x1-clear.png"" data-lazy-src=""http://media.giphy.com/media/PL9x8wyeh6Viw/giphy.gif"" data-lazy-backup=""http://media.giphy.com/media/PL9x8wyeh6Viw/giphy.gif"" alt="""" height=""207"" width=""500""><noscript><img class=""alignnone"" src=""http://media.giphy.com/media/PL9x8wyeh6Viw/giphy.gif"" alt="""" height=""207"" width=""500""></noscript></figure>
<p>Every skin color and its particular blemishes are unique, so don’t settle for “dark,” “medium” or “light.” It’s worth investing in a product that truly fits your face.</p>
<p>For her part, Perkins raves about <a href=""http://www.amazingcosmetics.com/products/amazing-concealer"" target=""_blank"">Amazing Cosmetics Concealer</a>, a pricey formula that also happens to come in 20 different colors. Because you’ll only use a small dab at a time, the makeup expert recommends investing in a truly luxurious – and effective – product.</p>
<p>If the concealer falls outside your budget, rest assured there are plenty of quality alternatives. Both Make Up Forever Full Cover Concealer and <a href=""http://www.narscosmetics.com/USA/radiant-creamy-concealer/999NACRCC0001.html?dwvar_999NACRCC0001_color=7845012344#start=1"" target=""_blank"">Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer</a> consistently garner high marks on both shade variety and formula from reviewers.</p>

<p>Without the right shade of concealer, no one will buy your cover up. But, even worse than choosing a not-quite-right color is the decision to liberally layer&nbsp;it on. Perkins recommends using a brush designated specifically for concealer, ensuring you’re not applying it too heavily.</p>
<p>Once the makeup is on your skin, use your ring finger to pat it in and ensure maximum bonding with your foundation.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FoundationFeature-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/can-you-get-herpes-from-sharing-lipstick/,Beauty,Can You Get Herpes From Sharing Lipstick?,"<p>I would never, ever, share any beauty products with a stranger, but when it comes to friends, I’m pretty lax about offering anything in my makeup bag. If you’re my friend, I know you, I know what’s up and I know what you have.</p>
<p>I obviously wouldn’t knowingly share anything with someone who had any type of topical ailment. That may sound bad, but whatever, a girl has to look out for her own, you know? More women should be conscious about where the makeup they’ve been using has been before, especially after hearing about MAC’s latest lawsuit.</p>
<p>According to the NY Daily News, Harlem woman Starkeema Greenidge (28) alleges that she contracted the herpes virus when a representative for MAC Cosmetics applied a used tube of the Rihanna-inspired RiRi Woo lipstick to her lips at the Rihanna concert at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t able to work for two weeks. It cost me a a lot of money,” Greenidge, a waitress, told the Daily News on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Greenidge is now suing MAC in Manhattan’s Supreme Court, saying: “The company should train its employees to use disposable tubes or swabs to apply the lipstick. This is going to happen over and over again if nothing is done.”</p>
<p>Agreed. But did she really contract the virus via a shared lipstick? The jury is still out on whether or not she got the virus from a tester at the concert, but Greenidge is right about two things: 1. You can in fact contract the herpes simplex virus from a lipstick that’s been infected by it and 2. That all beauty companies should be mindful of training their employees to properly apply makeup with disposable tubes or swabs.</p>
<p>It’s also your responsibility, as a consumer, to look out for yourself. If you notice a makeup artist approaching your face with a product, remind them to use a swab or to open a new container, for your own health.</p>
<p>“In general, it’s a good rule of thumb to not use anyone else’s lipstick, toothbrush, what have you,” says Larry Beatty, M.D. “If you had chapped lips or a break in the skin and swipe on a lipstick that someone used that’s infected with the herpes simplex virus, then you’re more susceptible to contracting it. But even if your skin is 100 percent intact, it’s still not a guarantee that you’d be protected from getting it; there is still a degree of risk.”</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/the-deception-is-real-app-allows-users-to-slim-down-their-selfies/,Beauty,New App Allows Users To Slim Their Faces Down In Selfies So They Look Better,"<p>All #selfie lovers take note — this new app offers personal Photoshopping for your face.</p>
<p>With the help of a new app, <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/app/skinneepix/id828723892?mt=8"">SkinneePix</a>, concerned selfie-takers can their edit photos so that they appear thinner (before posting to all social media channels, of course).</p>
<p>The app, which costs $0.99, allows users to decide how much “weight” they want removed from their photos, from five, 10, to 15 pounds.</p>
<p>Created by <a href=""http://prettysmartwomen.com/skinneepixapp/"" target=""_hplink"">Pretty Smart Women</a>, the founders of SkinneePix say they thought of the idea for the app out of a need they had noticed among friends and avid posters.</p>
<blockquote><p>“All we heard people say was ‘delete that, don’t you dare tag me in that, this is horrible.’ After the last vacation, we were like we can do something about this. You’ve always heard about the camera adding 15 pounds, we just wanted to level the playing field.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Although the tech start-up claims the app is helping women feel beautiful in photos, it’s also reinforcing the beauty ideal that seeming skinny is everything.</p>
<p>But, app creator Susan Green claims that the app encourages women to want to get healthy:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The first time I saw myself in that app, I felt better seeing my face a little slimmer. It’s not this huge change. When I saw it I remember thinking, ‘Gosh, I feel better about this picture,’ and that’s only 15 pounds. If I can lose 15 pounds and look like that…”</p></blockquote>
<p>But it more sounds like this app will simply provide a new breeding ground for eating disorders and increased insecurity.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/beauty-guide-cosmetic-products-photos/956210/,Beauty,"Finally, A Beauty Guide For All The Products You Have No Clue How To Use","<p>My first experience with makeup took place at the “cosmetics store” in my hometown: Walmart. Armed with $15, absolutely no knowledge of brands and I-just-turned-13&nbsp;stubbornness, I purchased the sparkliest, cheapest eyeshadow out there.</p>
<p>Long story short, my eyelids broke out and I was scarred from using makeup for the remainder of my adolescence.</p>
<p>It’s been solid 10 years since the episode with the World’s Most Heinous Eyeshadow.</p>
<p>I’ve grown up. I wear mascara. I’ve even learned how to <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/best-long-last-lipstick/887198/"" target=""_blank"">wear red lipstick</a>, but walking into Sephora is still overwhelming and confusing.</p>
<p>I couldn’t give you a coherent definition of what a luminizer does or explain the key differences between foundation and concealer if my face depended on it.</p>
<p>But, it’s not just my lack of expertise making my head spin in the aisles. Makeup is confusing. Magazines and beauty bloggers bombard us with cosmetics&nbsp;promising to change our skin for the better.</p>
<p>About 30 different products claim to rid our faces of under-eye circles.</p>
<p>We’re pretty sure if we ask an employee for help, we’ll be told we <em>absolutely need</em> these five products, and if we only spend about $150, our lives will never be the same again.&nbsp;Understanding which products do what for your skin shouldn’t be this difficult.</p>
<p>In order to clear up any confusion, Elite Daily spoke to Los Angeles-based professional makeup artist <a href=""http://www.jennakristina.com/"" target=""_blank"">Jenna Kristina</a>&nbsp;and Rebecca Perkins, professional makeup artist and co-owner of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.rougeny.com/"" target=""_blank"">Rouge</a>, a makeup salon she cofounded with Stephanie March, and got the lowdown on some of the most seemingly basic cosmetics.</p>
<h2>CC Cream</h2><a href=""http://www.sephora.com/colored-clay-cc-primer-P384569?skuId=1577857"" target=""“_blank&quot;"">Sephora<br></a>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: Also known as a “color or complexion corrector,” a CC cream is similar to a BB cream, but a little more potent.</p>
<p>CC creams improve coloration, whereas BB creams smooth everything out. (Still confused? Get familiar with&nbsp;<a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/what-is-bb-cream-how-to-use-it/946270/"" target=""_blank"">WTF BB cream does</a>.) Perkins&nbsp;describes it as “the eye cream to BB’s face cream.”</p>
<p><strong>How to use it</strong>: Your fingers are the easiest way to apply the product.</p>
<p><strong>When you’d use it</strong>: When you’re going out and you know you tend to get a little red in the face after you throw back three shots.</p>
<p><em><strong>Pro tip</strong>:</em>&nbsp;Read the fine lines, but don’t expect everything the product promises.</p>
<p>Perkins says there’s a lot of “marketing jargon at this point,” so a separate moisturizer, sunscreen and foundation will give you more protection and coverage than just a CC cream.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Face Primer</h2><a href=""http://www.sephora.com/beauty-flash-balm-P95044?skuId=74476 "" target=""“_blank&quot;"">Sephora<br></a>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: “A primer is used to smooth out your skin and hold your makeup on longer,” says Kristina.</p>
<p><strong>How to use it</strong>: “I always recommend using a moisturizer first; it’s always necessary even if you’re oily (just use an oil absorbing&nbsp;one),” Kristina adds. “Then apply your primer.”</p>
<p><strong>When you’d use it</strong>: Your day is packed with meetings, you’re running in and out of the office and then you’re meeting friends for happy hour.</p>
<p><em><strong>Pro tip</strong></em>: A face primer isn’t ALWAYS necessary. Unless your skin tends to be a bit oily, a good moisturizer and a face mist will keep your makeup on throughout the day or night.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Luminizer</h2><a href=""http://www.sephora.com/foundation-primer-hydrating-P151915?skuId=939744 "" target=""“_blank&quot;"">Sephora</a>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: Kristina advises a luminizer “gives your skin a nice healthy glow when applied to the higher points of your face, like your cheekbones.”</p>
<p><strong>How to use it</strong>: Luminizer&nbsp;comes as either a powder, cream or liquid. For a quick and easy application, add a drop of luminizer in your tinted moisturizer or foundation, and apply wherever you think your skin could lose a little brightening (cheekbones, corners of your eyes).</p>
<p>If you’d rather not blend your products, you can dab the luminizer in those same areas over other makeup.</p>
<p><strong>When you’d use it</strong>: Girls’ nights out when you know you’re going to be taking a lot of pictures — you’ll want to glow on Instagram.</p>
<p><em><strong>Pro tip</strong></em>: When looking for a luminizer, Perkins suggests finding a “very finely milled” product. You don’t want to choose a luminizer with chunks of glitter, it’ll only accentuate the lines on your face and remind you&nbsp;of your early days of makeup experimentation.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Toner</h2><a href=""http://www.sephora.com/clarifying-toner-P4015?skuId=654236"" target=""“_blank&quot;"">Sephora</a>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: “A toner works well to balance the pH level in your skin,” Kristina says, adding it also helps “remove any leftover residue.”</p>
<p><strong>How to use it</strong>: Grab a cotton pad doused with toner and lightly wipe away any of the makeup or dirt left on your skin. Make toner part of your daily routine if you don’t see any negative side effects (like dry skin or&nbsp;irritation).</p>
<p><strong>When you’d use it</strong>:&nbsp;After you wash off&nbsp;your makeup.</p>
<p><em><strong>Pro tip</strong></em>: Make sure your&nbsp;toner doesn’t have an alcohol base, which could irritate your&nbsp;skin and cause more damage. For a safer pick, stick with a water-based toner.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Setting spray</h2><a href=""http://www1.bloomingdales.com/shop/product/rodial-dragons-blood-toning-spritz?ID=699863&amp;pla_country=US&amp;cm_mmc=Google-PLA-ADC-_-GS-Beauty-_-Rodial-_-5060027061571USA&amp;CAWELAID=120156070000089392&amp;CAGPSPN=pla&amp;catargetid=120156070000456207&amp;cadevice=c "" target=""“_blank&quot;"">Bloomingdale’s</a>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: Setting sprays are used to prolong your makeup.</p>
<p>You won’t stress&nbsp;if your foundation is smearing across your face, making you look drunker than you are because you know it’s in place — and staying that way.</p>
<p><strong>How to use it</strong>: Finish your entire beauty routine&nbsp;and hold the spray about an arm’s length from your face. Spritz a couple of times and let dry.</p>
<p><strong>When you’d use it</strong>: Right before you scramble out in the morning.</p>
<p><em><strong>Pro tip</strong></em>: A setting spray with a little bit of glycine, will help&nbsp;“take away any ‘makeup-y’ (cakey/powdery) finish and melt the makeup into the skin,” says Perkins. The last thing you want is your setting spray leaving any sticky residue behind.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Tinted Moisturizer</h2><a href=""http://www.sephora.com/argan-tinted-moisturizer-P379438?skuId=1506666"" target=""“_blank&quot;"">Sephora</a>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: Moisturizes, obviously, and gives you a little coverage. It’s similar to a BB cream, but without a&nbsp;primer creating the soft layer beneath the product.</p>
<p><strong>How to use it</strong>: Apply with hands or a brush. Kristina notes, “Just conceal any spots or under-eye and you’re good to go.”</p>
<p><strong>When you’d use it</strong>: Kristina also says tinted moisturizer&nbsp;is “perfect for when you just want to even out the skin tone but don’t want to be fully covered.”</p>
<p><em><strong>Pro tip</strong></em>:&nbsp;Once you find a tinted moisturizer that works for you, keep it; buy it in bulk; take it with you everywhere. It’s good for your skin all-year round, and with a little eye shadow and lip balm, you can look put together without actually spending time applying&nbsp;your makeup.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151617/Stocksy_txpa2c32a52rnW000_Small_170800-800x400.jpg

<p>The digital&nbsp;“mirror,” designed by University of Toronto professor Dr. Parham Aarabi,&nbsp;combines facial recognition technology with a high-resolution camera to reflect the user’s three-dimensional image onto the tablet-like device’s screen.</p>
<p>Beneath the reflected image are menus for each feature — eyes, lips, cheeks, skin — and in those menus, there are thousands of sub-categories to further organize the virtual makeup application.</p>
<p>The software is programmed with thousands of different makeup styles and colors for each facial feature.</p>
<p>Also programmed in ModiFace’s software, as Dr. Aarabi explains, is a “universal shade matching system,” which uses a scanner to detect a user’s skin color and provide “instant recommendation[s] and preview of products that are completely personalized.”</p>
<p>The scanner can also be used to scan the color of items — say, a favorite shirt — to find a matching makeup shade.</p>
<p>Dr. Aarabi boasts,</p>
<blockquote><p>Our patented glance-based recommendations are a game changer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tester Erica Tempesta agrees. After trying out the ModiFace Mirror, she reported being extremely impressed with the gadget’s capabilities and accuracy.</p>
<p>She concluded that while she wouldn’t rely on it as foolproof, the ModiFace Mirror would be great to use as a way to narrow down products — specifically trickier ones like foundation — before trying them on in real life.</p>
<p>The ModiFace Mirror made its official commercial debut last week, and Dr. Aarabi believes they will soon be a staple at cosmetic counters and specialty makeup stores.</p>
<p>Smartphone users can download an app version of the technology at the <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/app/makeup/id314603460"" target=""_blank"">Apple Store</a>.</p>
<h2>The before-and-after, split-screen function allows users to compare two looks at once.</h2>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/biggest-makeup-mistakes-how-to-fix/996476/,Beauty,The 5 Deadliest Beauty Sins We’ve All Committed And How To Fix Them,"<p>The only thing that can tarnish memories of a glitzy night&nbsp;out with friends is checking your pictures the next morning.</p>
<p>When you applied your makeup, you aimed&nbsp;for early 90s Gwen Stefani, but instead you looked more like Courtney Love.</p>
<p>Not only did you&nbsp;avoid noticing your face was a different color than your neck, you’re also embarrassed it’s taken you two decades to learn anything about applying&nbsp;makeup — and you’re still smearing on foundation with your fingers.</p>
<p>Of course, you did spend your middle school years layering&nbsp;clear lipgloss so thick your friends could practically see their reflections. Change takes time.</p>
<p>Rest assured, it’s not too late to mend your erring ways.</p>
<p>We spoke to professional makeup artist&nbsp;<a href=""https://instagram.com/sarahbeattymakeup/"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Jane Beatty</a>&nbsp;who gave us the lowdown on the most grievous crimes against concealer, mascara and more.</p>
<h2>Know your face and flaunt your best features.</h2>
<p>The best makeup will always be customized to fit your facial structure.&nbsp;With this&nbsp;in mind, trends like ultra-heavy Instagram brows and sharp contouring are likely to fade out of popularity in time. Instead of perfecting what’s trendy, fit your own face.</p>
<p>Choose an area and master it: Learn the perfect nude lip or how to make your liquid eyeliner come to a razor-sharp edge.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Natural light is your new best friend.</h2>
<p>According to Beatty, none of us seem to know&nbsp;our own skin color. (Oops.) Your foundation may be “sandy beach,” but your concealer is “warm neutral.” Combining&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;shades is a recipe for blotchy, uneven skin, kind of like Lindsay Lohan on any red carpet. (Love you though, LiLo.)</p>
<p>A concealer that’s too light will actually <em>accentuate</em> any puffiness in your face instead of banishing it, while too much bronzer will&nbsp;turn your face a different color than your body. To avoid&nbsp;hue-based errors, invest in a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Conair-Oval-Double-Sided-Lighted-Mirror/dp/B000U0F9GA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428618308&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=lighted+vanity+mirror"" target=""_blank"">lighted mirror</a> or&nbsp;apply your makeup near a window.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Skip the Sahara desert and moisturize your face.</h2>
<p>If there’s only one step you take each morning, it should be to reach for the facial lotion after washing your face. Although makeup can act as a temporary fix for many problems, there’s no foundation strong enough to hide dry or&nbsp;flaky skin.</p>
<p>To avoid a case of the peels, Beatty recommends exfoliating regularly and never skimping on moisturizer. A little SPF never hurt, either. By paying attention to your skin, you create a smooth canvas for&nbsp;your makeup to&nbsp;sit.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Stand out by blending in.</h2>
<p>Makeup errors&nbsp;usually begin&nbsp;with small mistakes, like splotches or emphasis in the wrong place. Beatty recommends purchasing&nbsp;a <a href=""http://www.sephora.com/beautyblender-P228913"" target=""_blank"">Beautyblender</a>&nbsp;to create the illusion of perfect skin: Dampen, then use the seamlessly-blended foundation and concealer. You’ll be HDTV worthy.</p>
<hr>
<h2>And if you only remember one thing…</h2>
<p>Remember eyeliner applied <em>only</em> on the bottom lashline is a recipe for disaster. Think: A “Real Housewife” when the cameras have just arrived.</p>
<p>Beatty adds, “it makes your eyes look smaller and droopy… just don’t do it.”</p>
<p>So finish your look, ladies; it’s called “fashionably late” for a reason.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151040/Stocksy_txp064f96bcmuW000_Small_1939071-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/african-pop-singer-defends-her-whitenicious-skin-bleaching-cream/,Beauty,Propelling Negative Body Image? African Singer Defends ‘Whitenicious’ Skin-Bleaching Cream,"<p>If you look at the marketing behind the <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2586963/White-means-pure-African-singer-defends-Whitenicious-skin-bleaching-cream-accused-encouraging-people-change-skin-tone.html"">ill-named “Whitenicious” cream</a>, you’d probably think the product was intended for full-body skin bleaching.</p>
<p>But the cream’s creator, African singer Denica, is insistent that this isn’t the case.</p>
<p>Although the skin-bleaching cream’s most recent ads show Denica with all-over lighter skin tones, she says that the product is only meant for reducing minor blemishes and discoloration.</p>
<p>But she herself is perpetuating a ton of mixed messages about the “beauty” product itself and how women of color view their bodies.</p>
<p>After going on the defensive, Denica claims that she created Whitenicious because <span id=""ext-gen92"">“white means pure, not necessarily skin, but in general.”</span></p>
<p>This is weird because we think she looks way worse as the pasty and unnatural looking person in those advertisements. But whatever, we’re not the only ones who have taken offense.</p>
<p>Oscar-winning actress Lupita <span id=""ext-gen95"">Nyong’o</span>, who has been outspoken about racism in the beauty and fashion industries, has advised women and girls against using skin bleaching tools.</p>
<p>But Denica is rejecting all of her critics’ well-made points about how such a product interferes with young girls’ ability to be confident in their own skins and skin tones, claiming that the decision to bleach her body is just the same as bleaching her hair.</p>
<blockquote><p><span id=""ext-gen96"">“I’m an adult and if I lighten my skin then that’s my choice, the same as bleaching my hair.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Denica might be of an appropriate age for determining how she wants to mutate her body, but the message that she’s sending to her impressionable fans is not OK.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/how-social-media-sparks-a-struggle-to-maintain-a-healthy-perception-of-what-is-beautiful/,Beauty,How Social Media Sparks A Struggle To Maintain A Healthy Perception Of What Is Beautiful,"<p>I wake up in the morning ready to embrace the new day.</p>
<p>There is nothing better to me — a young and ambitious woman — than a beautiful, sunny morning. You never know what a new day will bring.</p>
<p>I yawn, stretch and daydream a little as I lie in bed, thinking mostly about future travels to tropical islands.&nbsp;I hop out of bed and head to the kitchen, all smiles, until I stop in front of my fridge and contemplate what to eat for breakfast. It should be simple, but that question begins the day-long battle with pressure-filled decisions.</p>
<p>It’s the questions that every young Millennial woman is forced to confront, and the answers must lead us to being beautiful, successful, desired and perfect.</p>
<p>If it’s not some kind of cleanse, it’s a diet or at least the thought of being on a diet. Breakfast is just the start; then there’s planning lunch, dinner and snacks. The other choice is to just not give a flip, go out to eat with my friends and deal with the guilt later.</p>
<p>Television, movies and social media all pull apart, mold and stretch women thin, to the point where they are nothing but plastic. Their worth is calculated into dress sizes and smooth skin.</p>
<h2>Back to breakfast</h2>
<p>I make a smoothie full of deliciously nutritious fruits and vegetables and I enjoy it, yet I’m still not sure if I ate it because I am supposed to or because I wanted to. Quickly after breakfast, it’s time to plan my workout.</p>
<p>Some days it fits in easily with my life and others it’s like pulling teeth, but I commit to it anyway. Everyone tells me bikini season is approaching and I should be fully aware that my peers will be judging my body come summertime.</p>
<p>My mind flashes to images on Pinterest of fitspo, Brazilian butt blaster workouts, yoga bodies and beautiful women glistening in barely-there workout clothes.</p>
<p>“Strong is the new skinny,” repeats in my mind like a mantra that I am forced to adapt, mainly because the alternative that “skinny is in, don’t eat that cookie,” is something I don’t even want to consider.</p>
<p>I know that I love to feel strong, I know that my body feels great when I make it sweat and work hard and honestly I know my body looks great naked (I’ve been told many times *wink*).</p>
<p>I know these things and I love these things about my body, but then why is my motivation purely to look better? Who is to say I don’t already look good enough?</p>
<p>Still, I am terrified that if I don’t work hard to achieve some sort of unattainable physical standard of beauty, like the ones I see on those motivational Pinterest posts, I am not worthy of bikini season.</p>
<p>The mantra “strong is the new skinny” even seems to lose all value because I do not look like nor will I look exactly like those girls, regardless of how badass my workout was and how strong I feel.</p>
<p>When the gym is out of the way, I get ready for work. I stare in the mirror piecing together outfits that reflect a professional confidence, maintain a slight sexy allure and try to appear smart and sophisticated.</p>
<p>The closest I get to that is dark-wash skinny jeans, a nice black blouse and some flats. I probably won’t make it on to any fashion blog today with my #OOTD,&nbsp;but it works and I work it. I’m feeling great from my smoothie and my workout and the sun is still shining, so my head is held high as I make my way to work.</p>
<p>The time during my commute is spent catching up on social media. I am bombarded by photos, statuses and information that my brain tries to decipher and make relevant to my own life.</p>
<p>Inadvertently and unnecessarily, I begin to compare my life to everyone else’s. My lack of boyfriends, baby showers, jet setting and celebrity trainers forefront my thoughts, and my worth slowly diminishes with every swipe of my finger.</p>
<p>I do not feel as beautiful as the girl who is modeling for magazines. I do not feel as fit as the girl from high school who now teaches pilates and only eats vegetables.</p>
<p>I do not feel as exciting as the couple that spends half their year in Paris, and I do not feel as accomplished as the girl who just signed her first book deal. Surrounded — no, consumed — by all of this, I have difficulty finding the importance in my own life.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Afternoon</h2>
<p>When I arrive at work, I quickly fall into a routine and the day flies by as I eat my pre-packed healthy lunch at my desk and take short breaks to catch up on some news.</p>
<p>Towards the end of my workday, I watch my boss walk into a room where he is having a meeting with his boss. I start to realize that I have never really been treated like I could be a boss or even like I possess capabilities.</p>
<p>Often I feel as though I get swept under the rug, brought up to think that maybe one day I’ll just meet a rich man and then I won’t have to work, because girls like me shouldn’t have to work (whatever that means).</p>
<p>The strong female career role models I have drawn strength from are often over shadowed by Kardashian types.</p>
<p>I find myself worrying more about my weight and desirability than if I am feeling fulfilled in my job. When I do think of a woman who is strong and successful, it feels so out of reach its almost too overwhelming to grasp.</p>
<p>Women like Oprah, Hillary Clinton, J.K. Rowling, etc. who are beautiful, powerful and have worked so hard to achieve their success.</p>
<p>Then I begin to think, if only I looked better maybe I could just be an actress and marry a producer and I wouldn’t have to strive to be the exception to the rule.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Night</h2>
<p>Finally work is coming to an end and I have a promising date tonight. I am so excited because Tinder and OKCupid have brought me nothing but dick pics and drunken boredom. I pour my thoughts into finding clothes that make me look like the fun, cool and hot girl you’d see at a dive bar.</p>
<p>I drink a glass of wine to calm my nerves. I vow to be all the things I am told a guy wants. I will be carefree and fun and make him laugh. I will call him on his BS then smile sweetly when he pays me a compliment. I will be interested and uninterested at the same time, all while looking naturally beautiful.</p>
<p>Despite any level of chemistry, I will be a bit of a tease and on no terms will I sleep with him. My plan feels flawless. Regardless if I will like him or not, he is sure to fall head-over-heels for me. We meet, and he is so good-looking and charming that it knocks me off my game a little, but I persevere and enjoy myself greatly.</p>
<p>We talk, laugh and listen to music, and the night feels like one of my daydreams. I keep him in line and he is a perfect gentleman who sends me off like a prince with the promise of many more nights and a goodnight kiss.</p>
<p>I go home and lie back in bed, those nagging thoughts throughout my day float out of my ear back into the universe and all that fills my mind is music and memories of the night.</p>
<p>With a few more dates and a little less self-control, those Pinterest images of beauty begin to seem dumb. Celebrity beauty becomes superfluous, and I begin to feel like I’m finally fitting into society’s standard. My worth feels restored.</p>
<p>It’s been over two weeks since our third date and I haven’t heard from the guy. My mind cannot seem to wrap around an answer. I scan the Internet for articles to help me cope with the situation.</p>
<p>Advice like, “he’s just not that into you” and “it was all about the chase” is popping up everywhere, yet I can’t seem to connect the dots.</p>
<p>I know this is normal and it’s not the end of the world, but immediately I start to spiral into a whirl of self-doubt where “what ifs” become beauty comparisons to strangers and girlfriends who I could look nothing like.</p>
<p>I lose all sight of the fact that I was charming, smart, funny and completely amazing and wonder how I can quickly lose 10 pounds just in case I run into him in the next week.</p>
<p>I feel betrayed by my genetics, chalking up the whole situation to his desire of the unrealistic expectations of women and still I feel defeated. Like our culture says, it isn’t his fault; he was just being a guy. I couldn’t hold his interest; I wasn’t everything a woman should be.</p>
<p>Every day I mindfully practice self-acceptance and love. I feel it is me against the world, and if I don’t think of myself as worthy, no one else will. As hard as I try, even my strongest attempts are often destroyed the second I encounter a beauty comparison to someone else.</p>
<p>I work hard to grow in experience and be present in this life as a smart, funny and creative woman, even when the world tries to pound into my head that all of my self-worth is based solely on my appearance.</p>
<p>Who am I to question the world? But I am fighting for my freedom from drowning in thoughts of diets and products and dissatisfaction. Women often establish a mean girl mentality to protect themselves from the judgment in the world, but that only pulls us apart.</p>
<p>Men find it okay to treat us as though we are objects. My only true answer has been to seek a life where there are as few of these impositions as possible. It’s no wonder my daydreams consist of islands where you live in pure happiness far from media influences.</p>
<p>I use awareness as the tool to keep those influences from invading my life. I do my best to reinforce confidence and self-love into the people around me, I respect my fellow women, I give men the chance to step up and I support media influences that challenge societal norms of beauty.</p>
<p>But until our world changes its perception of a young woman’s role in society, beautiful and smart women like me will have hundreds of days like these.</p>
<p>Alone we can attempt to resist these pressures, but together with love, we can fight it. You are perfect and so full of worth just the way you are.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/can-now-buy-stockings-laced-pheromones-idiots/,Beauty,When Perfume Isn’t Enough: You Can Now Purchase Stockings Laced With Pheromones,"<p>What the hell is the world coming to that women are now opting for pheromone-laced pantyhose to seduce men? Since when is a woman’s brain and natural beauty not sufficient enough to elicit male attention and attraction?</p>
<p>These laced stockings are brought to us by the Hush Hush range by hosiery firm Ballerina. The pheromones are supposed to communicate a subconscious signal to members of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>While people’s natural pheromones are produced in our sweat glands, these are a clear synthetic replication.</p>
<p>I can’t even help but have a million questions about this. Is this actually something women will purchase? Are you serious? Won’t taking five to 10 <a title=""elite daily"" href=""http://elitedaily.com/news/world/praise-lord-tequila-can-actually-aide-weight-loss/"" target=""_blank"">tequila</a> shots lead you to get the same results these stockings are hoping to achieve?</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be more effective for a man to wear something to this effect? Isn’t it easier to seduce a man than a woman?</p>
<p>Until Spanx comes out with a line of these stockings, I will not be purchasing them.</p>

Tuesday&nbsp;morning, Beyoncé took to her website to reveal her latest project: a <a href=""http://www.refinery29.com/2014/12/78800/beyonce-nail-art-ncla-collaboration#page-1"" target=""_blank"">nail art collaboration</a> with cosmetics company NCLA.</p>
<p>Though unexpected, her foray into the nail art world shouldn’t come as a complete&nbsp;surprise to fans: Bey is known in the beauty industry as having&nbsp;a&nbsp;penchant for <a href=""http://www.refinery29.com/2013/02/42674/beyonce-gold-nails-art-super-bowl"" target=""_blank"">fab fingertips</a> and a range of <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/21/beyonce-nails-inauguration-2013_n_2521264.html"" target=""_blank"">beauty looks</a>.</p>
<p>Now, we&nbsp;mere mortals can emulate the musician’s, well, <em>flawless</em> looks.</p>
<p>The collection, which consists of four packs of nail wraps, is inspired by Bey’s music, with each pattern representing a different beauty persona, from glam to street-cool.</p>
<p>A plaid decal dubbed I Woke Up Like This is a subtle nod to the shirt she wears in her “***Flawless” video; the funkier Je Ne Sais Quoi is printed with the rainbow neon lights featured in the video for “Blow;” the No Rest In The Kingdom wrap is inspired by the glamorous Tom Ford ensemble she wore to accept her MTV Video Vanguard Award; and I Come With A Side Of Trouble features scribbles and lyrics pulled from her latest album.</p>
<p>Further, all of the designs are a representation of Beyoncé’s own beauty MO.</p>
<p>Her longtime manicurist Lisa Logan <a href=""http://www.vogue.com/5690217/beyonce-ncla-nail-wrap-collaboration-winter-manicures/"" target=""_blank"">explains</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>You can never peg what [Beyoncé] wants to wear or who she wants to be that day — you have to be able to switch it up.</p></blockquote>
<p>With zero drying time needed, the press-on decals are ideal for switching it up. And at $18 a pop, they’re cheaper than your average manicure.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/summer-hair-celebrity-hairstylist/1109341/,Beauty,FLOTUS And RiRi’s Hairstylists Debunk Common Summer Hair Myths,"<p>Whether you sport ‘The Rachel’ every season or swap hairstyles like Taylor Swift switches BFFs, we’ve all fallen pray to horrible hair fads.</p>
<p>But heavy is any head that wears an unhealthy crown due to follicles fables. (Yeah, we wax poetry about hair.)</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">It’s one of our most prized possessions, the ultimate accessory (besides <a title=""Things You’re Doing That You Don’t Even Know Are Hurting Your Vagina"" href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/vagina-women-health/1107091/"" target=""_blank"">this</a>), so it’s about time we learn some hair do’s and don’ts from the people who know hair best.</p>
<p>Elite Daily phoned <a href=""http://www.ursulastephen.com/the-salon/"" target=""_blank"">Ursula Stephen</a>,&nbsp;hairstylist who counts Rihanna — yes, she’s responsible for&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.mtv.com/news/1651070/rihanna-says-now-iconic-haircut-was-really-liberating/"" target=""_blank"">The Bob</a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;Laverne Cox and Taraji P. Henson as clientele. We also spoke to&nbsp;<a href=""https://twitter.com/johnny_wright"" target=""_blank"">Johnny Wright</a>, who handcrafts First Lady Michelle Obama’s royal mane, to debunk the myths and teach us best practices for healthy summer hair.</p>
<h2>Myth: Heat damage is only caused by&nbsp;hot tools.</h2>
<p>We&nbsp;toss our flat irons and blowdryers to a hair drawer abyss in hopes of curbing heat damage, not even thinking summer sun can do just as much frying. As Stephen says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like your skin, sun can fry and dry your hair if you leave it exposed, especially if you have color treated hair.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What you should do:</strong> TBH, no one wants to tote around a full arsenal of hair goods. But if you’re planning on getting vitamin D wasted, it’s best to stay ready.</p>
<p>“Definitely [have] a hat or scarf, a heat protectant spray that has sunscreen in it and maybe a leave-in conditioner cream or spray with you,” Stephen advises. “Depending on your hair type, style and texture, the spray-on ones are great because they’re not as messy and have good coverage. But if you have thicker hair, it’s better to have the creamy, conditioner-like ones.”</p>
<p>Wright suggests carefree bed-head style to beat the heat.<b> “</b>I always tell women to pull their hair up into a messy top knot, the not-so-perfect coif. It just reminds me of the freeness of summer — makes the hair a little sun-kissed, too.”</p>
<hr>
<h2>Myth: Conditioning-only is better than shampooing.</h2>
<p>This myth is best served with a grain of salt. Co-washing, short for conditioner-only washing<b>, </b>is&nbsp;neither true nor false, depending upon what your hair needs.</p>
<p>“I’m not a co-wash kinda girl, but I get why women do it,” Stephen tells us. “If you have natural hair or hair that tangles or is frizzy, co-washing keeps it soft for a longer period of time. If you use a cleansing shampoo, it strips hair and dries it out a little bit. It’s cleaning your hair of all the toxins and all the products that build up on the hair strand.”</p>
<p><strong>What you should do:</strong>&nbsp;Hair regimens aren’t one size fits all.&nbsp;If your hair is most manageable during that oddly dirty period, skip daily washes, pin it up and go. Take note: Only opt for co-washing if your strands can stand a few extra shower cap&nbsp;days.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Myth: Wash your dyed hair pre-pool dip.</h2>
<p>Don’t get bent out of shape about breakage on this one. It’s more about avoiding green, Grinch-like tresses.</p>
<p>If you’ve recently colored your hair, Stephen advises to “let the cuticle rest” and steer clear of chlorine. She adds, “When you just process your hair, the cuticle is still open and fresh,” which can cause an unwanted color change.</p>
<p>But if&nbsp;you really can’t avoid going into the pool, then Stephen suggests “coating your hair with conditioner.”</p>
<p><b>What you should do:&nbsp;</b>Be sure to&nbsp;shampoo your hair post-pool as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“The quicker you get the chlorine off your hair, the better,” Rihanna’s mane woman says. “And they have swimmer shampoos that are targeted toward girls who&nbsp;swim a lot.”</p>
<p>In general, if you commit to color at any point, pull back on using heat products, especially in the summer. Cover it, up your use of conditioners and opt for a quality hair mask.&nbsp;“I always describe masks and conditioners as the 911 and the 311 of hair care,” she says.</p>
<p>Wright, on the other hand, says&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.softsheen-carson.com/dark-and-lovely/hydra-steam-moisturizing-system/c/pl"" target=""_blank"">SoftSheen-Carson Hydra Steam treatments</a> are what his&nbsp;clients enjoy. “It keeps the color more vibrant, more rich,” he explains. “And it also helps to keep the moisture intensity in the hair.”</p>
<hr>
<h2>Myth: Eating a meat-based diet helps your hair grow.</h2>
<p>Both experts recommend&nbsp;plant-based diets for women who want&nbsp;healthier, continuously-growing hair. Stephen credits avocados as&nbsp;a major game-changer.</p>
<p>“I eat more avocados and I can see the difference.”&nbsp;Stephen says.</p>
<p>“You are what you eat,” Wright agrees. “Just add more vegetables to your diet, period. I’ve noticed hair is stronger, healthier and maintains more natural moisture.”</p>
<p><strong>What you should do:</strong>&nbsp;Keep a balance. Whether you’re chowing down cow or keeping a rabbit-friendly diet, don’t skip on your hair’s molecular needs. It’s best to grub on various food rich in everything from iron, zinc and biotin to vitamins A and C for shine and thickness.</p>
<p>“Take vitamins,” Stephens adds. “They’re definitely a plus because you still want healthy hair. But if you’re not meant to have super long, thick hair, it’s just not in your genes.”</p>
<hr>
<h2>Myth: Cold water rinses are&nbsp;the secret to great hair.</h2>
<p>“There’s some truth to that,” says Stephen. “Cold rinses do enhance a certain type of shine, and it does preserve the color of your dye.”</p>
<p><strong>What you should do:</strong> To maintain shine and volume, make you hair regimen like your summer beverage: a cocktail. “I use an SPF spray or a humidity spray and the <a href=""http://www.target.com/p/motions-style-create-versatile-foam-styling-lotion-8-5-oz/-/A-16608613"" target=""_blank"">Versatile Styling Foam by Motions</a>,” Stephen reveals. “It’s better to find that product that you can reapply during the day.</p>

<p>“I’ve been working with Rih for 9&nbsp;years now, so we talk about her hairstyles all the time, whether I’m there or not,” she added. “We started this together so it’s just an evolution of everything we’ve done.”</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/HairMyths-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/stress-affects-skin/,Beauty,How Stress Affects Your Skin,"<p>Stress is not only an annoyance, or an uncomfortable feeling, but stress can seriously affect your common bodily functions. Stress is a result of a chemical response, which can affect all kind of hormone spikes, leading to a multitude of issues.</p>
<p>One in particular, is the affect that stress has on your skin. When you’re stressed, so is your skin, leading to an increase in sensitivity and reactiveness. Your skin is more susceptible to breakouts, oil, fever blisters, and skin infections (such as cold sores) when you’re more stress.</p>
<p>Why is this? Stress impairs the proper function of your skin, because it dries your skin out. Because your skin is so dried out, your body tries to moisturize it on it’s own by secreting more oil onto your skin.</p>
<p>In addition to becoming oilier, stress can cause you to rub and scratch your skin more than usual, increasing your chances of skin damage. Studies have shown that living a stressful life increases out chances of getting skin cancer, or even allowing skin cancer to spread quicker.</p>
<p>These are some scary side effects; so take a few extra steps in ensuring that you reduce the affects of stress on your skin:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t neglect your skin even if you’re stressed,&nbsp;keep up with your skincare routine:&nbsp;especially SPF!</li>
<li>Take time (even if it’s just 10 minutes) to do something for you: read your favorite book,&nbsp;take a bath.</li>
<li>Say no! Set limits and boundaries to give yourself a break.</li>
<li>Go out for a walk – clear your mind.</li>
<li>Exercise regularly – it’ll help keep your mind fresh and sweat out some toxins from your body.</li>
<li>Try some stress-management techniques: deep breathing or yoga.</li>
<li>Get at least 7-8 hours of sleep.</li>
</ol>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/extreme-beauty-trends-double-jaw-surgery/,Beauty,Extreme Beauty Trends: Double Jaw Surgery,"<p>Women everywhere always want what they can’t have. If you’re born with straight hair, you want curly hair. Some women hate their noses, while other women complain about their eyelashes — the list of bodily complaints goes on and on.</p>
<p>Some women just complain for the sake of complaining, but others actually are deeply bothered by their appearances. Those women are the ones who would go to any length to achieve their own personal sense of beauty. Everyday a strange new beauty treatment comes into fruition, but this one could be much more serious than it seems.</p>
<p>According to the Daily News, there’s a new shocking beauty trend on the rise called double-jaw surgery, which is pretty self-explanatory. The recipient of this procedure undergoes a surgical procedure to realign the upper and lower jawbones, resulting in a dramatically reshaped face.</p>
<p>The Daily News claims that this surgery is on the rise in South Korea after multiple celebrities went on television extolling the surgery as a “turning point” in their lives. There are even advertisements for this surgery throughout the country proclaiming “Everyone but you has done it,” with surgery clinics claiming that they are “The double jaw surgery clinic chosen by the pickiest ladies.”</p>
<p>It’s disgusting that such advertisements even exist considering how dangerous the procedure is. One professor of dentistry was quoted by the paper, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This surgery alters your look far more dramatically than, say, Botox or a nose job because it changes your entire facial bone structure. But it’s a very complex, potentially dangerous surgery… it’s disturbing to see people with no real dental flaws daring to go through it just to have a small, pretty face.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So how dangerous can this surgery actually be? Some of the detrimental side effects include paralysis, permanent facial numbness, nerve damage and chronic jaw pain. One study even found that 52 percent of patients experienced sensory problems and in one case a 23 year old committed suicide after the double jaw surgery left her unable to chew food or stop crying from damage to her tear duct.</p>
<p>Embrace your natural beauty and steer clear from extreme procedures — the price of “perfection” is way too high.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/sushi-beauty-skin/948414/,Beauty,The Beauty Of Sushi: You Can Use Your Favorite Cuisine As Skincare,"<p>Women are&nbsp;<a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/17-reasons-science-says-not-fault-youre-addicted-sushi/917426/"" target=""_blank""><em>always</em> down for sushi</a>: It’s the perfect cure for a bad day at work or the dinner of choice among friends before a girls’ night out.</p>
<p>If this were a love story, sushi would be the fresh, veggie-loaded Romeo to our hungry-mouthed Juliet.</p>
<p>We&nbsp;love it so much we’d bathe in it if we could — and in fact, you can.</p>
<p>How’s this for a complementary surprise?: In&nbsp;the beauty world, many of sushi’s most popular ingredients are known as cure-alls. (Which means you don’t have to rely on just ordering it to feel and look great.)</p>
<p>So order a bento box, pull on a cozy bathrobe and let sushi&nbsp;give&nbsp;you on a spa date.</p>
<p>Here’s how to get your beauty routine <em>roll</em>ing:</p>
<h2>1. Nori Face Mask</h2>
<p>The chewy, dried seaweed wrap also has&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.livestrong.com/article/98362-benefits-seaweed-skin/"" target=""_blank"">anti-inflammatory</a>&nbsp;properties, making a nori face mask a no-brainer for those with acne-prone skin.</p>
<p>Follow the advice of <a href=""http://www.xovain.com/skin/diy-seaweed-mask-with-dried-sushi-nori"" target=""_blank"">xoVain’s Trista Crass</a> and soak a few sheets of nori in water before applying them to your face for calm, even skin in no time at all.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. Rice Water Toner</h2>
<p>The white rice you rely on for sticky, carby goodness is actually one of the most versatile ingredients in your bento box.</p>
<p>Historically, Japanese women evened out their complexions with rice water, thanks to its sizable&nbsp;concentration of skin-firming&nbsp;B vitamins like folate and thiamine.</p>
<p>While it’s available for <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Face-Shop-Bright-Cleansing/dp/B0065FYPB4"" target=""_blank"">purchase</a>, make like Martha Stewart and DIY your own with&nbsp;Free People’s&nbsp;<a href=""http://blog.freepeople.com/2014/03/cleansing-rice-water/"" target=""_blank"">simple, 15-minute rice soak</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Wasabi Massage Oil</h2>
<p>Lime green wasabi can do more than just clear our your sinuses.&nbsp;Your favorite spicy&nbsp;condiment can&nbsp;help ease sore, cranky muscles after a tough workout or a rough week at the office.</p>
<p>Thanks to a compound called 6-MSITC, wasabi’s repeatedly shown it&nbsp;works as a circulation-boosting&nbsp;<a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=t22vBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA796&amp;lpg=PA796&amp;dq=wasabi+6-MSITC&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SPDrQKuXaO&amp;sig=-H6iV7a6LjP3MGZRYAt89epVSUE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J__uVI_aDcXFgwTOh4TQCw&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=wasabi%206-MSITC&amp;f=false"" target=""_blank"">anti-inflammatory</a>&nbsp;supplement.</p>
<p>Try it out yourself with a StacyKnows’s <a href=""http://stacyknows.com/2010/wasabi-not-just-for-sushi/"" target=""_blank"">homemade massage oil recipe</a>, a version&nbsp;of the one used at Austin’s&nbsp;Lake Austin Spa Resort.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. Avocado Hand Treatment</h2>
<p>Give the most Instagrammed fruit a break from your sushi-ordering hysteria. Instead of biting into avocado’s&nbsp;creamy green flesh, take advantage of&nbsp;its <a href=""http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrientprofile&amp;dbid=100"" target=""_blank"">high biotin content</a> to renew the scaly skin on your hands.</p>
<p>Paradise Grove recommends <a href=""http://paradisegroveavocados.com/blog/2013/11/28/1400/"" target=""_blank"">making a hand mask</a>, sort of like a guacamole dip for your skin.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. Ginger-Mustard Foot Soak</h2>
<p>After a sushi dinner, pickled ginger is the perfect palate cleanser. Likewise, after&nbsp;a long day, you can use&nbsp;ginger as a spa treatment to get you refreshed&nbsp;for tomorrow.</p>
<p>The pungent root contains the compound&nbsp;gingerol, an <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=5WY08iuJyawC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=gingerol+antibacterial&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1MpH0wcUUA&amp;sig=mG_dLGsHYPxdb4CkuIQzmFLCsgw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4CfvVLTDMcGDNoGpgnA&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwDDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=gingerol%20antibacterial&amp;f=false"" target=""_blank"">antibacterial</a>&nbsp;powerful enough to kill any foot funk while still soft enough to soothe your tired skin.</p>
<p>Try Wild Turmeric’s <a href=""http://www.wildturmeric.net/2014/03/foot-scrub.html"" target=""_blank"">mustard-ginger foot soak</a>&nbsp;and pair it&nbsp;with a cup of hot ginger tea.</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. Clarifying Egg Shampoo</h2>
<p>The Egg Custard Tamago is one of sushi’s most popular dishes thanks to the popularity of 2011’s “Jiro Dreams of Sushi.”</p>
<p>Instead of debating an egg’s perfect texture, harness its protein&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.livestrong.com/article/159295-what-is-liquid-lecithin/"" target=""_blank"">lecithin</a>, a moisturizer, to produce softer hair still strong enough to resistant to breakage.</p>
<p>Once a month, try a <a href=""http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/beauty-hair/hair/tips/a31036/diy-egg-hair-wash/"" target=""_blank"">homemade egg shampoo</a> and a cool shower.</p>
<p>Hair-growth forums swear by an&nbsp;egg wash’s ability to <a href=""http://archive.longhaircommunity.com/showthread.php?t=21760"" target=""_blank"">transform your lazy locks</a> into a mane worthy of an Ariana Grande-inspired ponytail.</p>
<hr>
<h2>7. Kombu Bath</h2>
<p>Sushi rice is often cooked with a piece of kombu, a type of dried kelp with flavor-boosting properties&nbsp;so your grain doesn’t taste as&nbsp;dull.</p>
<p>Aside from being a <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/kombu-a-nutritional-powerhouse-from-the-sea/2013/01/29/aa4bb830-4ad4-11e2-a6a6-aabac85e8036_story.html"" target=""_blank"">dietary dynamo</a>, the kelp’s also been proven to <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11917251"" target=""_blank"">improve elasticity</a> in skin and keep you looking youthful, like an aspiring Meryl Streep.</p>
<p>To get your own fountain of youth, try a <a href=""http://www.edenfoods.com/articles/view.php?articles_id=98"" target=""_blank"">kombu bath</a> with strips purchased from your local health food store or Asian supermarket.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151053/Stocksy_txp90d7348fhuW000_Small_446656-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/real-cost-cheap-manicure/1028838/,Beauty,The Real Cost Of A Super Cheap Manicure Will Absolutely Blow Your Mind,"<p>In Manhattan, a manicure costs around $10.50 – just about the price of a sandwich. That’s where the trouble begins.</p>
<p>A vast, multi-section exposé from The New York Times’ <a href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/n/sarah_maslin_nir/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Maslin Nir</a>&nbsp;delves into the underbelly of the greater New York area’s manicure industry, exposing the nearly nonexistent wages and hazardous chemicals that form just one part of most nail artists’ everyday lives.</p>
<p>In more than <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/new-york-times-investigates-hidden-price-of-cheap-mani-pedis/"" target=""_blank"">200&nbsp;interviews</a>, which the Times notes were conducted in four languages over 13 months, the publication is exposing a miserable, sweatshop-like cycle of despair.</p>
<p>The first Times piece, “<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/nyregion/at-nail-salons-in-nyc-manicurists-are-underpaid-and-unprotected.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">The Price of Nice Nails</a>,” reveals many manicurists aren’t paid for their first few months of grueling work.</p>
<p>In fact, they often end up paying salon owners at least&nbsp;$100 to learn the trade, plus the added expenses for extra skills like waxing.</p>
<p>Even further into their careers, a majority of manicurists&nbsp;will make far less than minimum wage – especially if they’re Hispanic or Chinese; Korean workers receive preferential treatment. Packed into crowded vans from the suburbs, many are immigrants who live in overstuffed apartments with their coworkers.</p>
<p>“<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/11/nyregion/nail-salon-workers-in-nyc-face-hazardous-chemicals.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0"" target=""_blank"">Perfect Nails, Poisoned Workers</a>,” a follow-up piece, investigates the rashes, asthma and miscarriages many manicurists suffer from due to chemicals used on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Discouraged from wearing rubber gloves and disrupting salons’ luxury aesthetics, salon workers are reportedly plagued by skin conditions brought on by constant exposure to others’ hands and feet.</p>
<p>It’s a frightening revelation, even if your salon isn’t in New York City. By exposing the reality, Nir encourages customers to help change the system.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04150913/Stocksy_txp7d39a704GkW000_Small_438350-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/survey-men-think-womens-pubic-hair/1063799/,Beauty,As If It Matters: This Is What Men Really Think About Women’s Pubic Hair,"<p>It’s an age-old question: bare or bush?</p>
<p>According to an <a href=""http://www.askmen.com/grooming/appearance/opinions-on-women-s-grooming-survey.html?utm_source=hplifestylefb&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=partner"" target=""_blank"">AskMen.com</a> survey, when it comes to dudes’ preferences, <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/10/women-pubic-hair_n_7544288.html"" target=""_blank"">it’s Brazilian or bust</a>.</p>
<p>The Huffington Post teamed up with the male-oriented website to ask over 5,000 men about their pube preferences, and the answers may surprise you.</p>
<p>Though going bare down there was the top choice, survey findings indicated, on the whole, most guys don’t really give a f*ck what ladies do with their nether regions, so long as they’re clean and well-maintained.</p>
<p>Nearly half voted for “completely bare,” with one f*ckboy insisting,</p>
<blockquote><p>The only hair on a woman should be on her head.</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s obviously single.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a&nbsp;full 38 percent said they prefer some hair — but well-groomed — and 5 percent voted for the full bush. Nearly a fifth claimed they had “no preference,” and 1 percent said “other,” most likely referring to a landing strip or some other shaped situation.</p>
<p>But there’s a&nbsp;catch. Even though men have their preferences, it’s not going to stop them from getting their dicks wet. Only 9 percent said they ended a date early because of her bush or lack thereof. One participant said,</p>
<blockquote><p>If you’ve made it to third base… and you want to call a timeout due to grooming habits, then you are a huge douche.</p></blockquote>
<p>Agreed, sir.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to their own sh*t, most guys are pretty considerate. Only 12 percent claimed they felt no pressure to groom at all. Nearly half replied they groom for themselves&nbsp;but don’t feel pressured, and the rest felt it’s the appropriate thing to do.</p>
<p>It should be noted the survey spanned a range of age groups, and preferences may break down differently among younger or older males.</p>
<p>That said, it really doesn’t&nbsp;matter what anyone thinks, <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/brazilian-waxing-men-women/1061332/"" target=""_blank"">as long as <em>you’re</em> happy </a>with your appearance down there.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vLpChCiMrKg.jpg

<p>Outline your natural French tip with blue. Make sure the outline is thicker than normal so you can lay the red on top evenly.</p>

<p>Make sure you wait until the blue is completely dry before applying the red, otherwise you’ll have purple tips. If you feel impatient and this happens, just wait for it to dry then layer the red tip again.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/benefits-sulfatefree-hair-care-products/,Beauty,The Benefits of Sulfate-Free Hair Care Products,"<p>How do you take care of your hair? Do you wash your hair with hydrating shampoos and conditioners? Do you use shampoos that are specific to color treated hair or condition with a conditioner that is specific to enhancing volume?</p>
<p>Every woman uses different products that cater to their needs, but what every woman should also do is make the switch to sulfate-free products. Yes, your hydrating and moisturizing and volumizing shampoos and conditioners no doubt make your hair feel clean and soft, and they do work, but at what cost?</p>
<p>Sulfates, also known as SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate), SLES (sodium laureth sulfate), ALS (ammonium laureth sulfate) are inexpensive and powerful surfactants, or sudsing agents, that hair care companies use as a cheap ingredient in their shampoos and conditioners.</p>
<p>Sulfates contain salts and chemicals, which can dry out your hair cuticles and follicles in addition to causing damage to your scalp. Irreparable damage. In addition to drying and damaging your hair, sulfates can even permanently fade your natural (or paid for) hair color.</p>
<p>As if the damage to your hair wasn’t enough, it has been proven that products that contain sulfates can eat away at the natural fats in your body that moisturize your skin, simply by washing your shampoos out and having the suds fall down your body. Sulfates were first introduced to shampoos and conditions as a way to strip away dirt and oil from your hair, but what most women don’t realize is that your natural oils are meant to <em>naturally</em> moisturize and clean your hair and body.</p>
<p>Using products that contain sulfates can strip away your natural hair oils that are necessary to keep your hair happy and healthy. So if I haven’t convinced you to make the switch to sulfate-free products yet, maybe this will help: the damage sulfate’s causes your hair is <em>irreversible</em>.</p>
<p>Make the switch, just like I have, and I promise you’ll notice a huge and beneficial difference. Yes, the downside to making the switch is that some sulfate-free products are more expensive than your typical shampoos and conditioners because most sulfate-free precuts use natural and organic ingredients. In my opinion, it’s worth it.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/broke-but-beautiful-the-most-expensive-cities-for-womens-haircuts/,Beauty,Broke But Beautiful: The Most Expensive Cities For Women’s Haircuts,"<p>It’s no secret that living in New York City is significantly more expensive than most other cities. Chicago might have a high sales tax, but NYC is definitely up there when it comes to basic needs, like food and shelter.</p>
<p>And here’s a new one to add to the list of overpriced items you can find in NYC: women’s haircuts.</p>
<p>Apparently, vanity knows no price when it comes to styling hair.</p>
<p>The folks behind Square, a mobile device-based point of sale system, released findings that showed the average price for a woman’s haircut in NYC is a whopping $73! <strong>(Click To Enlarge):</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><a href=""http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/square-haircut-prices.png""></a><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via&nbsp;<a href=""http://qz.com/182766/and-the-most-expensive-city-in-america-for-a-haircut-is/"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">Quartz</span></a>&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p>While that’s only two dollars more than runner-up city, San Francisco,&nbsp;New Yorkers can hold on to one small shred of hope because the average price for a male’s haircut in SF is noticeably greater than NYC’s: $49 compared to the Big Apple’s $37.</p>
<p>Hmm, perhaps Jennifer Lawrence was onto something with her pixie cut? How much is too much to spend on a haircut?</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/best-long-last-lipstick/887198/,Beauty,The 5 Best Long-Wear Lip Colors To Get You Through The Holiday Season,"<p>We already know all about the transformative power of makeup,&nbsp;but what about everyday wear? Which products offer the most bang for your buck and have the power to take your look from zero&nbsp;to 100 in just one application?</p>
<p>Answer: lip color. There is nothing quite as “notice me” as a colorful, bold lip — and lipstick is the sort of instant refresher that’ll perk up your entire look even if the rest of your face is bare.</p>
<p>We rounded up the best long-wear lip colors to get your pout through every party — you know, so you can spend your time drinking (socializing?) instead of reapplying.</p>
<p>We test-ran all of the below products at our own holiday party, so we know from experience these lip colors aren’t going to leave you hanging 30&nbsp;minutes in.</p>
<h2>Urban Decay Revolution Lipstick</h2>
<p>Though it’s not marketed as long-wear, Urban Decay’s super-pigmented Revolution lipstick will last throughout any boozy soirée and comes highly recommended from our testers.</p>
<p>The lipstick is formulated with what the company calls a “Pigment Infusion System,” which gives the product intense, lasting color.</p>
<p>One tester remarked that the lipstick “didn’t smudge,” even after several drinks, and added that the consistency is “soft and felt natural to wear… not at all heavy, dry or sticky like others [she’s]&nbsp;used in the past.”</p>
<p><strong>Get it:</strong> <a href=""http://www.urbandecay.com/revolution-lipstick-by-urban-decay/378.html"" target=""_blank"">Urban Decay Revolution Lipstick</a>, $22</p>
<hr>
<h2>Josie Maran Coconut Watercolor Lipstain &amp; Shine</h2>
<p>This lip stain/gloss duo had the longest-lasting color of any product we tried.</p>
<p>One end of the product holds a felt-tipped marker for applying coconut water-infused stain, while the other end has a shiny, Argan oil-infused matching gloss to layer over the stain.</p>
<p>Our tester said it “didn’t leave lip marks on glasses or cups,” and stayed put for at least four hours; for another, it lasted closer to eight.</p>
<p>Note that the stain truly does stain your lips — so you’ll want to make sure your kisser is well primed (exfoliated, moisturized and smooth), to ensure even coloring.</p>
<p>And, of course, to maintain shine, you may need to reapply the gloss. Still, the color’s staying power is pretty much unbeatable.</p>
<p><strong>Get it:</strong> <a href=""http://www.sephora.com/coconut-watercolor-lip-stain-shine-P390969"" target=""_blank"">Josie Maran Coconut Watercolor Lipstain &amp; Shine</a>, $22</p>
<hr>
<h2>Elizabeth Arden Beautiful Color Moisturizing Lipstick</h2>
<p>This ultra-moisturizing classic lipstick is one of the creamiest and smoothest we tried.</p>
<p>According to the company, the formula is “clinically proven to keep lips moisturized all day,” and provides “exceptional color payoff that lasts for 12 hours without feathering or fading.”</p>
<p>Our testers agreed, noting very little smudging after eating and drinking and little to no fade, making it a great “low maintenance” option.</p>

<p><strong>Get it:</strong> <a href=""http://www.elizabetharden.com/Beautiful-Color-Moisturizing-Lipstick/1002BLSC400,default,pd.html"" target=""_blank"">Elizabeth Arden Beautiful Color Moisturizing Lipstick</a>, $25</p>
<hr>
<h2>Revlon Colorstay Overtime Liquid Lipcolor</h2>
<p>This drugstore staple claims to last an incredible 16&nbsp;hours, thanks to the included chamomile-infused clear topcoat that&nbsp;locks in the color. Our tester revealed that the color amazingly lasted until the next day, and even required makeup remover to take off.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a one-and-done option, this is it, but know that it’s a commitment. You’ll want to reapply the topcoat as you wear to keep lips feeling moisturized, since the base formula is a bit drying.</p>
<p>Still, for its longevity and affordability, Revlon’s Colorstay is a solid go-to.</p>
<p><strong>Get it:</strong> <a href=""http://www.drugstore.com/revlon-colorstay-overtime-liquid-lipcolor-unlimited-mulberry/qxp80118"" target=""_blank"">Revlon Colorstay Overtime</a>, $10</p>
<hr>
<h2>Mac Retro Matte&nbsp;Lipstick</h2>
<h2></h2>
<p>This matte-finish formula was suggested by one of our testers, who swears by a&nbsp;punchy fuchsia shade dubbed “Flat Out Fabulous.”</p>
<p>The super-saturated color is “really intense,” and boasts a matte finish, as the name implies, which makes the color “insanely long-lasting.”</p>
<p>Our tester noted the intensity may fade over time, but the color stays put: You’ll need makeup remover to get it off completely. How’s that for staying power?</p>
<p><strong>Get it</strong>: <a href=""http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/shaded/168/310/Products/Lips/Lipstick/Lipstick/index.tmpl?SKU_ID=SKU49838&amp;LOCALE=en_US&amp;cm_mmc=google-_-MAC+-+US+Shopping+Campaign-_-All+Products-_-PLA&amp;gclid=CLDulvHU68ICFaFr7AodwSIABw"" target=""_blank"">MAC Retro Matte Lipstick</a>, $16</p>
<hr>
<h2>Honorable Mention: Clinique Long-Last Lipstick and&nbsp;Avon Ultra Color Bold Lipstick</h2>
<p class=""p1"">This beloved <a href=""http://www.clinique.com/product/1605/5404/Makeup/Lipsticks/Long-Last-Lipstick"" target=""_blank"">Clinique</a> ‘stick won the hearts of our testers for its “super silky” feel. With 22 shades to choose from, it “lasted about five hours with eating and drinking.” Plus, the moisturizing formula is chock-full of lip lovin’ ingredients, including olive oil and aloe.</p>
<p class=""p2""><a href=""https://www.avon.com/product/52039/ultra-color-bold-lipstick"" target=""_blank"">Avon’s Ultra Color Bold Lipstick</a>&nbsp;boasts “50 percent more pigment” than the company’s other lip colors, meaning it packs a serious punch in the color department. It may leave marks on your glass if you’re drinking, but&nbsp;the color will stay “pretty vivid regardless.”</p>
<p class=""p2"">And at just $8, the&nbsp;ultra-pigmented shade&nbsp;feels way more expensive than it is.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04150913/Stocksy_txp7d39a704GkW000_Small_438350-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/makeup-claim-to-improve-moods/1015454/,Beauty,The Real Deal Behind Makeup Claiming To Enhance Your Mood,"<p>I’ve always been interested and mesmerized by mood-changing products, like mood rings and lip glosses that change colors depending on your feelings.</p>
<p>It’s reassuring&nbsp;to have something external&nbsp;validate your emotions.</p>
<p>Recently, cosmetic&nbsp;companies have been&nbsp;introducing specially-formulated makeup that claims to enhance your mood and desires.</p>
<p>Makeup products that change your mood? That means no more weekly hours spent on yoga, sipping on chamomile tea or clenching my fists over life’s daily demands, right?</p>
<p>I mean, it’s still makeup at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Upon discovering these brands have launched mood-enhancing makeup products, the question has to be asked: Is this true, or are we just&nbsp;<a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/cant-resist-makeup-packaging-photos/1002756/"" target=""_blank"">suckers for good marketing</a>?</p>
<p>Apparently, it all comes down to what ingredients these products use and how they really correlate to the mood-enhancing triggers in our systems.</p>
<p>Let’s look at Physicians Formula’s Glow and Mood Boosting Blush:</p>
<p>The product claims to make you&nbsp;happy due to the&nbsp;ingredient: Euphoryl. <a href=""http://www.physiciansformula.com/en-us/productdetail/face/blush/07320.html"" target=""_blank"">According to the company</a>, euphoryl is used to “promote a feeling of happiness by mimicking the effect of endorphins.”</p>
<p>However, upon researching euphoryl, there is actually no link with endorphins. Instead, it stimulates dopamine.</p>
<p>And, yes, it can be argued that dopamine (with its link to helping make us “happy”) in makeup can have mood-boosting effects, meaning the product works. But this still isn’t the case.</p>
<p>In case you don’t remember from Psychology 101, dopamine is a chemical signal that gets passed throughout the brain. It is only produced in the brain.</p>
<p>There is no way dopamine can get passed through your skin and find its way into the brain.</p>
<p>According to dermatologist, <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201106/beauty-treatment-mood-makeup"" target=""_blank"">Ronald Brancaccio</a>, “It’s difficult for any compound to be absorbed into the bloodstream via the skin.”</p>
<p>So unfortunately for us, this blush won’t&nbsp;make us feel as if we are running through a hill of roses. Instead, it will most likely have a placebo effect.</p>
<p>There are also other cosmetics that use well-known aphrodisiacs, which many people actually believe will boost your mood.</p>
<p>Let’s look at <a href=""http://mojospa.com/product/11/light-my-fire-lip-balm-for-love-passion"" target=""_blank"">Mojo Spa’s Light My Fire Lip Balm for Love and Passion</a>:</p>
<p>This product claims to enhance your&nbsp;passion and love life through its inclusion of rose quartz and aphrodisiacs, such as chocolate and caramel.</p>
<p>First of all, it is very difficult to conclude the validity of rose quartz’s effects and there have been studies done that provide evidence for there being<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/health/18real.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">&nbsp;no significant link</a> between aphrodisiacs, like&nbsp;chocolate and caramel and our moods.</p>
<p>Basically, these so-called mood-enhancing makeup products are more in your mind than they are factual.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, they are fun and cute ideas that also happen to make us look pretty good.</p>
<p>That is the one and only link between makeup and our mood: both improve our appearances, which in return improve how we feel about ourselves. It has nothing to do with a specific, magic ingredient.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151044/Stocksy_txp18de2552BgW000_Medium_699070-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/favorite-beauty-tips/,Beauty,Five Of My Favorite Beauty Tips,"<p>I’ll sheepishly admit that I’ll be the first to try a gimmick. My mother calls me a marketer’s dream, because you can pretty much convince me of anything. Throughout the years, I’ve tried enough tips and suggestions that I’ve accumulated a vast archive of beauty tips that rivals the knowledge of any licensed cosmetologist. Kidding, but maybe not.</p>
<p>So I’ve decided to list five of my favorite beauty tips. I hope that they help you as much as they’ve helped me. Some of these may seem obvious, you may even follow some of the same rules, but if I help at least one of my readers, I’ll be happy.</p>
<p>1. If you have greasy hair, avoid directly conditioning roots and condition from your ear down to ends.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Always use a moisturizer with SPF in the morning. Even in the winter.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;When applying bronzer, first start by applying it around the perimeter of your face and follow with a light dusting on your forehead, nose and chin.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Get quick volume by using a root lifter, then use hairspray to set hair. This will prevent it from fall flat during the day.</p>
<p>5. Seal in your makeup by spraying hairspray over your face. Trust me. This works.</p>
<p>Do you use any of these beauty tips on yourself?</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/country-claims-nose-jobs-year/,Beauty,What Country Claims The Most Nose Jobs Per Year?,"<p>Plastic surgery is becoming more and more common amongst women. Would you think that America is the country with the highest rate of nose jobs per year? Think again.</p>
<p>In Iran, women pay, on average, four to eight times their monthly salary for cosmetic surgery, and are getting seven times as many nose jobs per capita than we are in the United States.</p>
<p>Girls as young as 14 are getting surgical procedures done in hopes of looking more “westernized.” Each year, as many as 2000,000 women (and men) ask cosmetic surgeons to make their noses smaller and to shift upwards. Iran currently has the highest rate of nose job surgery.</p>
<p>What’s even more shocking is the financial aspect. On average, Iranians make around $360 a month, and a nose job in Iran can cost anywhere from $1,400 and $2,865. Women are sacrificing in other aspects of their lives just to have a smaller nose.</p>
<p>How does this make you feel? Is it worth it? I don’t think so.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/introducing-monthly-nail-polish-subscriptions/,Beauty,Now Introducing: Monthly Nail Polish Subscriptions,"<p>Monthly subscriptions are taking over every aspect of… life basically. From Netflix, to wine of the month clubs, to beauty boxes, the newest major move in monthly subscriptions is that of monthly nail polish subscriptions.</p>
<p>Nail polish is an absolutely integral aspect of any female’s beauty regimen, so it’s only fitting that companies specialize their monthly subscriptions to solely providing consumers with a monthly package of polishes.</p>
<p>In this past year, a few subscription companies have popped up:</p>
<p>One being, <strong>Julep</strong>. The cult polish brand, which is based in Seattle, was one of the very first companies to launch a nail polish subscription service. Launched by a former Starbucks executive, the monthly subscription service, called Julep Mavens, works as such:</p>
<p>$19.99 per month gets you a monthly box that includes two full sized polishes and a beauty product (like hand lotion). You can also choose to skip months or send your box to a friend.</p>
<p><strong>Color Me Monthly</strong> is a subscription service that was founded by two sisters with an aim to provide eco-friendly polishes to the masses. Consumers pay $7 and get one polish a month complete with a haiku card describing the color. These polishes are formulated without dibutyl phthalate (DBP), formaldehyde and toluene, and the bottles are laser-etches as opposed to printed, which is better for the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Square Hue</strong> is another simply run company. $21 a month gets you three polishes every month and each month’s box is themed, and a surprise. Philanthropic as well as lucrative, 30% of profits from these sales go to charity, with hopes to improve that percentage.</p>
<p>Finally, nail art lovers rejoice with the <strong>Nail Art Society</strong> subscription. $9.95 a month gets you polish and some nail art tools.</p>
<p>Will you be subscribing to any of these businesses?</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/clinique-launching-specific-nail-polish/,Beauty,Clinique Launching Specific Nail Polish,"<p>Clinique is an extremely well known beauty brand, which excels in skin care products. They of course offer a wide range of cosmetic options, but nail polish has never really been the retailer’s strong suit.</p>
<p>They’re dabbled in the polish game before, but this new launch is something that the company has certainly never tried. Clinique will be releasing a summer nail polish collection.</p>
<p>Pretty standard. So what’s so specific and different about this line of polish? The polish collection will be specific to sensitive skin. It’s specially formulated for sensitive skin, and Ophthalmologist-tested, meaning it’s safe for people with most allergies to use.</p>
<p>The Clinique Nail Enamel Collection features fun new colors, appropriate for summer. The colors host names such as 70 and Sunny, Grape Ice, Pinkini, Strappy Sandals and Summer in The City.</p>
<p>Interested in picking up some of these polishes? Head over to any Clinique counter, or online, to purchase a bottle, for $16.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/spring-essentials-per-nyc-neighborhood/,Beauty,Spring Essentials Per NYC Neighborhood,"<p>It’s time to ditch the winter jackets — although it might be almost May, warmer temps have just finally set in all across Manhattan.</p>
<p>And with the new season and the soon-to-follow spring cleaning, it only makes sense that everyone’s wardrobes deserve a similar refresh.</p>
<p>You are what you wear, and you should no doubt be dressed according to your favorite Manhattan hangout area before the insufferable summer temps set in.</p>
<p>So we’re breaking down spring’s most important fashion essentials, to be purchased and worn according to your New York City neighborhood.</p>
<h2>Upper East Side: Stiffly Striped</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via <a href=""http://wheretoget.it/look/350106"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">Tumblr</span></a></em></span></p>
<p>Fur stoles are out with the cold, and nautical stripes are in with the temperate spring weather on the UES. Whether you’re meeting your posh blue-blooded Grandma to get a leg up on the inheritance or are simply a lady who lunches (a stiff martini on the side being optional), keep your striped ensemble looking upright, uptight and uppity. It is the&nbsp;<em>Upper</em> East Side, dahling.</p>
<p>This style can be interpreted a number of ways, but it’s best to wear your Breton garb nice and loose—after all, it’s the most favorable way to experience the breeze while watching the sailboats in your corner of Central Park.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Upper West Side: Intellectually Plaid</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via&nbsp;<a href=""http://fake-leather.com/never-give/"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">Fake Leather</span></a></em></span></p>
<p>If you’re walking to classes at Columbia (or if you’re just heading in that direction to scope out the hot professors and soon-to-be graduates), you better dress the part.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.oliviapalermo.com/plaid-play/"" target=""_blank"">According to Olivia Palermo</a>, soft plaids are back…and they give immediate legitimacy to your Ivy League credentials.</p>
<p>These Gossip Girl-reminiscent plaid pants gives a little edge to your uptown neighborhood, which makes sense, since you’re on the <i>west side </i>of the island.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Midtown: Mixed, Not Messy</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via <a href=""atlantic-pacific.blogspot.mx/2013/07/summer-lbd.html"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">Atlantic-Pacific</span></a></em></span></p>
<p>Don some knee-high gladiator sandals to scare the tourists there for Times Square. Pair them with anything and you’ll still be wearing more clothes than the Naked Cowboy.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Hell’s Kitchen: Take Cover</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via <a href=""http://barefootblonde.com/2014/03/camouflage/"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">Barefoot Blonde</span></a></em></span></p>
<p>With a name so obviously tough, you might as well dress for the role and go full out with a camouflage print.</p>
<p>While Hell’s Kitchen has a ton of great dining options, it’s notoriously not the most clean… as would be any neighborhood that houses Penn Station. So this print is a great way to camouflage any of that NYC grit and grime you’ll be sure to collect on your journey through the ‘hood. Or you know, disguise the fact that you were there in the first place.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Murray Hill: Shifting Attitude/ Into the Real-World</h2>
<p><em><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;"">via <a href=""http://www.theblondesalad.com/2012/06/make-it-easy.html"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">The Blonde Salad</span></a></span></em></p>
<p>Want a killer look to go with your bagel? A shift dress perfectly mimics the transition from your college dorm room to er, your new Murray Hill <del>dorm room</del>&nbsp;apartment (which is still an upgrade from the frat house).</p>
<p>The shapelessness of a sheath dress ensures your doorman won’t get offended, while also still leaving your cute neighbor wondering what the hell you got going on underneath.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Chelsea: Artistic Prints</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brooklynblonde.com/2012/09/prime-pattern.html"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">Brooklyn Blonde</span></a></em></span></p>
<p>In this neighborhood, known as NYC’s art epicenter, consider your clothing a canvas.</p>
<p>You’ll want to spend spring channeling ‘60s cool while roaming through Chelsea’s industry-style art spaces. Not unlike Andy Warhol’s Factory.</p>
<p>Chaotic and colorful prints will help you stand out among the orderly museum-quality shows at some of Chelsea’s most up and coming galleries, like David Zwirner’s spot on 19<sup>th</sup> street.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Meatpacking: Step In-Style</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/zoje8ymlmjl4g41/102313_linesheet-update_s14_womens1_noprice.pdf"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">Yosi Samra</span></a></em></span></p>
<p>With treacherous cobblestones lining the streets, heels are ill-advised in the Meatpacking District. You can still match the ranks of fashion’s finest with cute and colorful flats and loafers.</p>
<p>While a metallic pastel would certainly make the <a href=""https://www.yosisamra.com/"" target=""_blank"">Yosi Samra</a> shoes spring appropriate, a neutral snakeprint pattern on your loafers can similarly carry the shoe from transitional weather to warmer temps.</p>
<hr>
<h2>East Village: The One to Watch</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via <a href=""http://weheartit.com/entry/41980798"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">We Heart It</span></a></em></span></p>
<p>Home to many of New York’s most up-and-coming young professionals, you’ll want to finally follow mom and dad’s advice and invest in a shiny new watch this spring to catch up to all the excitement.</p>
<p>Although purchased to become yet another piece of arm candy to add to your stack of bangles, the perfectly-proportioned watch is useful for tracking your ascent into greatness.</p>
<p>Or you know, timing your trek to the gym to entirely avoid any awkward run-ins with the college BF (another East Village resident, of course) you appropriately dumped when you moved to the big city.</p>
<hr>
<h2>West Village: Street Chic</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via&nbsp;<a title=""Lee Oliveira"" href=""http://leeoliveira.com/"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">Lee Oliveira</span></a></em></span></p>
<p>Pop into any store on Bleecker and you’ll see the appropriate wear for the West Village. The price tags are fit for royalty, so you should similarly outfit yourself in one of the most popular trends from Fashion Week street-style favorites (which conveniently harkens back to times of overwhelming French hierarchy): culottes.</p>
<p>These breezy sort-of-shorts will help you rifle through the macaron-exclusive patisseries and peony-peddling flower bodegas, and are only slightly less attention-grabbing than a fit-for-Marie Antoinette headdress.</p>
<p>Sofia Coppola (a fellow West Vill resident) would be so proud.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Soho: For the So-Cool</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via <a href=""http://www.allaboutthestyle.net/2012/07/outfit-fashion-blog.html"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">All About the Style</span></a></em></span></p>
<p>You might have missed Coachella, but there’s still chance to dress like a flower child in this super chill neighborhood.</p>
<p>Something warmer will be needed inside the Angelika Film Center, so don’t be afraid to bundle up in a light bomber jacket.</p>
<p>Underneath you might be rocking a trendy crop top, but the bomber will keep your all-over ensemble from getting too (literally) cool.</p>
<hr>
<h2>NoLita: Patterned Block Party Play</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via <a href=""weheartit.com/entry/23165473/via/meganbleh"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #888888;"">We Heart It</span></a></em></span></p>
<p>You’ll be carbo-loading at New York City’s most amazing Italian restaurants more nights than you’ll likely want to admit, so better have pants that don’t prohibit massive pasta consumption.</p>
<p>Light harem pants will allow you to binge without having to unbutton, while an intricate tribal pattern will distract from your expanding waistline. Summer’s a few months away, so there’s always still time to hit the gym.</p>
<hr>
<h2>TriBeCa: Swagger On</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: xx-small; color: #888888;""><em>via <span style=""color: #888888;""><a href=""http://www.maxitendance.com/2013/06/parfum-eau-delice-dior-campagne-avec-daphne-groeneveld-saint-tropez.html"" target=""_blank"">MaxiTendance</a>/</span></em></span><span style=""font-size: xx-small;""><em><a href=""http://www.glamlatte.com/black-leather-accents"" target=""_blank"">GlamLatte</a></em></span></p>
<p>TriBeCa is home to Beyoncé, so when here, bring your fashion A-game. Although nearly see-through body suits a la the Grammy Awards might be OK for <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/music/beyonces-fatty-takes-grammys-jump-jay-z-also-video/"" target=""_blank"">some residents</a>, the investment bankers walking their way to FiDi might give you some weird looks.</p>
<p>So stick to the more subtle trends, like cat eye sunnies (Beyoncé approved) and a leather baseball cap. You’ll look like an undercover celebrity attempting to blend in, with the edge necessary to hang in Jay Z’s adopted hood.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/skype-doctor-cure-acne-photos/1059927/,Beauty,The New House Call: Can A Virtual Doctor Really Cure Your Acne?,"<p>In the realm of pop culture, acne is strictly a teenage plight.</p>
<p>Somewhere around middle school, painful red volcanoes make their home across the cheeks and foreheads of pizza-eating pubescent teens.</p>
<p>In real life, acne doesn’t end when you blow out the candles on your 20th birthday cake.</p>
<p>For many perfectly healthy adults, the eruptions and embarrassment continue long into college and a career.</p>
<p>Acne can often be humiliating because we’re made to feel as if it’s something we should’ve outgrown long ago.</p>
<p>Drinking countless liters of water and spending every paycheck on organic produce doesn’t fix the fact your body seems to have revolted against crystal-clear skin.</p>
<p>Until recently, adult acne was strictly the domain of quiet dermatologist offices.</p>
<p>Since 2014, however, a disruptive team of licensed dermatologists have made acne treatment a little more accessible with an exclusively online service called <a href=""https://pocketderm.com/?utm_source=PR&amp;utm_medium=Blogger&amp;utm_content=Elite%20Daily%20Article&amp;utm_campaign=Acquisition"" target=""_blank"">PocketDerm</a>&nbsp;(try a free month <a href=""http://bit.ly/1KadO40"" target=""_blank"">here</a>).</p>
<h2>It doesn’t take an apple to keep the doctor away, just an online visit.</h2>
<figure><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1061566"" src=""http://elitedaily.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/1x1-clear.png"" data-lazy-src=""http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PDBottle2.jpg"" data-lazy-backup=""http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PDBottle2.jpg"" alt=""PDBottle2"" width=""600"" height=""414""><noscript><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1061566"" src=""http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PDBottle2.jpg"" alt=""PDBottle2"" width=""600"" height=""414""></noscript></figure>
<p>For $20 per month or the cost of one dinner out, PocketDerm invites customers to submit images of their trouble zones (including both face and body) to a personal dermatologist.</p>
<p>Because acne is a visual diagnosis, an office visit isn’t necessary – and neither are the pricey fees.</p>
<p>In the name of science – and wearing a bikini this summer – I tried PocketDerm as a treatment for acne across my cheeks and back.</p>
<p>Stripping down and photographing your acne-prone back selfie-style is a humbling experience, but I’ll do anything in the name of a better complexion.</p>
<p>I’ve never sent a stranger selfies of my acne before, but I’m pretty sure they aren’t going viral anytime soon, so we’re in the clear (well, on our way at least).</p>
<hr>
<h2>My prescription is hope in a tiny bottle.</h2>
<figure><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1061541"" src=""http://elitedaily.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/1x1-clear.png"" data-lazy-src=""http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PDBottle1.jpg"" data-lazy-backup=""http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PDBottle1.jpg"" alt=""PDBottle"" width=""600"" height=""400""><noscript><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1061541"" src=""http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PDBottle1.jpg"" alt=""PDBottle"" width=""600"" height=""400""></noscript></figure>
<p>Just hours after sending my doctor, David Lortscher, images, he sent out a note recommending a treatment.</p>
<p>Here’s the other thing about PocketDerm: the branding is impeccable. They don’t just send you the topical treatments in the familiar drugstore packaging.</p>
<p>Each customer receives a frosted, customized bottle containing a prescription cream, labeled with your name, to be refilled as often as needed and applied before bed each night.</p>
<p>My particular cocktail includes Niacinamide, to reduce discoloration; Azelaic acid, which clears up redness while killing acne-causing bacteria; and Clindamycin, which reduces swelling and acne simultaneously.</p>
<p>Since the prescription is only applicable to my face, Lortscher laid out a comprehensive plan of separate products for my back.</p>
<p>The Pyrithione Zinc soap and Benzoyl Peroxide wash, both of which fell outside of my regularly-billed subscription, were pricier than what I’d normally purchase for the bath. But in the name of healthy skin, I clicked “buy.”</p>
<p>With the added note that sunscreen protection was crucial, Lortscher sent me well on my (digital) way.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Change is just a click away&nbsp;for problematic skin.</h2>
<figure><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1061573"" src=""http://elitedaily.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/1x1-clear.png"" data-lazy-src=""http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PDEmily.jpg"" data-lazy-backup=""http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PDEmily.jpg"" alt=""PDEmily"" width=""600"" height=""350""><noscript><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-1061573"" src=""http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PDEmily.jpg"" alt=""PDEmily"" width=""600"" height=""350""></noscript></figure>
<p>No waiting in the doctor’s office, no scary antiseptic smell: just the squishy comfort of my couch at home.</p>
<p>My bottle arrived several days later, and the great PocketDerm experiment commenced.</p>
<p>In the two months that have followed my initial purchase, I’ve seen small changes adding up to a clearer complexion.</p>
<p>My cheeks show less inflammation and scarring. Although one or two nasty pimples pop up across my cheekbones around the same time every month, they’re much more bearable than the constant outbreaks I once had.</p>
<p>And my back, which remains home to frequent painful breakouts, has shown some improvement. Older pimples have cleared up, but I still notice new blemishes fairly routinely.</p>
<p>Sunscreen, previously an afterthought, is now my first priority. I’m taking my skin more seriously than ever.</p>
<p>The toughest part of healing, however, is the waiting game.</p>
<p>Above all, acne takes time to heal.</p>
<p>As weeks pass, though, the frantic feeling of coping with a breakout is gradually replaced by the sense that my skin is the hands of a trained professional – all without ever leaving my apartment.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PDFeature-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/best-french-beauty-products/1110028/,Beauty,C’est Magnifique! The Best French Products To Ring In Bastille Day,"<p>In terms of style, the French really do have a certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em>: their t-shirts always drape <em>just so</em>, their skin always has that movie-star&nbsp;glow and I’ve yet to meet a French woman who can’t rock the daylights out of a red lipstick.</p>
<p>Part of the appeal of French beauty is that it never places an emphasis on being overly done up. Bold eyes are never paired with bright lips, and flushed cheeks often take center stage. Look no further than Brigitte Bardot or Charlotte Gainsbourg for the quintessential French beauty look: feathery lashes, <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/entertainment/celebrity/cara-delevingne-emilia-clarke-compete-best-eyebrows-video/1084203/"" target=""_blank"">groomed brows</a> and one point of focus (lips, eyes or cheeks).</p>
<p>In honor of Bastille Day, here is&nbsp;the very best of cult French beauty. From the tried-and-true <em>pharmacie</em> favorites to the high-end goodies, these are best of the best. Say hello to your inner Carine Roitfeld.</p>
<h2>Skin That’ll Make&nbsp;Mona Lisa Jealous</h2>
<p><b>Low-End: <a href=""http://www.drugstore.com/avene-thermal-spring-water/qxp168119?catid=182950&amp;aid=333840&amp;aparam=5ip.t6iarD8-obuyUQBwqMmLIg8.QDJttQ"" target=""_blank"">Avene Thermal Spring Water</a> ($18)</b></p>
<p>French chicks aren’t&nbsp;about an ultra-matte complexion. A bit of dew goes a long way: It makes you look like you more human and less like a china doll.</p>
<p>While admittedly, Avene Thermal Spring Water is basically H2O in a spray can, it’s hands-down one of the most refreshing products&nbsp;ever. It gives you that dew without having to work for it and the ultra-fine mist will never make you look sweaty. Keep one on your desk at work, one in your gym bag or&nbsp;one on your nightstand to spritz on your face&nbsp;when you aren’t 100 percent awake yet.</p>
<p><b>Mid-Range: <a href=""http://www.laroche-posay.us/hydraphase-intense-eyes-3337872412646.html#start=2&amp;cgid=eye-care"" target=""_blank"">La Roche-Posay Hydraphase Intense Eyes</a> ($34)</b></p>
<p>Dark, baggy eyes are the furthest thing from chic (unless you have artfully styled bags like Vanessa Paradis who somehow makes looking like you got three hours of sleep sexy).</p>
<p>While this stuff won’t get rid of your wrinkles, it’ll help reduce&nbsp;that puffy nonsense. Basically, use this every time you have a hot date that turned into a hot-mess morning after. Or, more realistically, on Netflix binge nights.</p>
<p><b>High-End: <a href=""http://www.dermstore.com/product_Rich+Thermo-Protective+Cream_12945.htm"" target=""_blank"">Phytomer Rich Thermo-Protective Cream</a> ($94)</b></p>
<p>You know what’s not cute about blasting office ACs? Dry skin that just won’t quit.</p>
<p>Apply this stuff prior to layering on your makeup and it’ll keep those scaly patches from appearing throughout the day. If you find that it’s too thick for you, use it at night as a sleeping mask. A little goes a long way, which is a good thing: If this tub nearly runs a Benjamin, you’d better make your month eating ramen the most moisture-rich ever.</p>

<h2>Clemence Poesy Wishes She Had These Locks</h2>
<p><b>Low-End: <a href=""http://www.net-a-porter.com/us/en/product/341703?cm_mmc=ProductSearchUS_PLA_c-_-Klorane-_-Beauty-Haircare-Shampoo-_-120545737762_341703-005&amp;gclid=CL7Sy4W12MYCFUoXHwodVP4Bfg"" target=""_blank"">Klorane Oat Milk Dry Shampoo</a> ($9)</b></p>
<p>Fact: French girls&nbsp;have great hair. Maybe it’s all genetics, or maybe it’s something in the water, but seriously: what French girl doesn’t look foxy in a messy bun?</p>
<p>The trick? They don’t wash their hair every day. Their natural oils do the work for them by&nbsp;creating tons of playful texture. This Klorane Dry Shampoo not only&nbsp;keeps the oils partying on their heads, but it also adds a touch of volume.</p>
<p>Anything that allows us&nbsp;to be as dirty&nbsp;as possible is a winner in our&nbsp;books.</p>
<p><b>Mid-Range: <a href=""http://www.sephora.com/phytolisse-ultra-glossing-finishing-serum-P13010?skuId=1438043"" target=""_blank"">Phyto Phytolisse Ultra-Glossing Finishing Serum</a> ($30)</b></p>
<p>French women prioritize <a href=""http://www.vogue.com/1908285/french-girl-beauty-secrets-hair-makeup-artist-violette/"" target=""_blank"">healthy, shiny hair</a>. Forget blow-drying your mane. An air-dried mop is both&nbsp;healthier and looks way more natural. Don’t OD on products, either: instead, opt for a lightweight finishing oil or serum on your ends for a bit of piece-y texture.</p>
<p><b>High-End: <a href=""http://www.oribe.com/shop/sprays-mists/dry-texturizing-spray.html"" target=""_blank"">Oribe Dry Texturizing Spray</a> ($42)</b></p>
<p>I’m not going to sugarcoat it: This sh*t makes you look like you <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/news/world/totally-french-make-word-sexting/"" target=""_blank"">just got it on</a>. It gives you that loose, messy texture that French babes are synonymous with, without the annoying legwork that comes with trying to artificially wand&nbsp;your hair.</p>
<p>Also, this spray&nbsp;gets bonus points because it smells like how I want my future husband to smell like.</p>

<h2>A Face&nbsp;That Belongs At The Moulin Rouge</h2>
<p><b>Low-End: <a href=""http://www.sephora.com/oil-infusion-color-care-P398017?skuId=1642248&amp;icid2=brand%20content__p398017_image"" target=""_blank"">Sephora Collection Oil Infusion Color &amp; Care</a> ($14)</b></p>
<p>Did you know Sephora is actually a French brand? Oh, you fancy, huh?</p>
<p>A&nbsp;bright red lip is a must for French women. It works as a focal point for a going out look and tones down a hangover. The Oil Infusion line from Sephora is so fantastic because it’s ultra-hydrating while still adding&nbsp;pigment and feeling like satin&nbsp;on your lips.</p>
<p><b>Mid-Range: <a href=""http://www.clarinsusa.com/en/wonder-perfect-mascara/C050203010.html?start=1&amp;dwvar_C050203010_color=01%20black"" target=""_blank"">Clarins Wonder Perfect Mascara</a> ($26)</b></p>
<p>Fluttery lashes are the antidote to a sleep-deprived weekend. Clarins — which is a favorite both in Paris and stateside — makes a wonderfully brightening mascara&nbsp;that adds length, volume and thickness.</p>
<p>Pair that with the Sephora red lip and you have your happy hour look down pat.</p>
<p><b>High-End: <a href=""http://www.sephora.com/tinted-moisturizer-broad-spectrum-P109936?skuId=870337"" target=""_blank"">Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 20</a> ($44)</b></p>
<p>Everyone waxes poetic about these tinted moisturizers and for good reason: They make you look like you’re not wearing any makeup at all while still evening out your skin tone. Go yonder and be the perfect French snowflake that you are.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/FrenchBeautyED-800x400.jpg

What if you didn’t shave your&nbsp;legs since <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/news/world/fourth-of-july-tiny-hamsters-tiny-bbq-video/1097265/"" target=""_blank"">Fourth of July</a>?</p>
<p>Same goes for nail salons and hair stylists: What if your hair hasn’t been washed in a week? What if you just came back from the gym and your feet stink like a sweaty yoga mat?</p>
<p>We caught up with some of our favorite spa owners, nail technicians and hair gurus to see what <em>really</em> grinds their gears.</p>
<h2>Let it go to voicemail.</h2>
<p>Adriana Martino, founder of <a href=""http://www.skinneymedspa.com/"" target=""_blank"">SKINNEY Medspa</a>, warned against answering your phone or texting during a treatment. “It isn’t the best thing to do (unless there’s an emergency) as you should pay close attention to what treatment you are having done.”</p>
<p>She also added that the treatment should be a time to build “a trusted relationship with your esthetician or technician for optimal results” — not a time to answer all your Tinder matches.</p>
<p>Kattia Solano, owner of <a href=""http://butterflystudiosalon.com/"" target=""_blank"">Butterfly Studio Salon</a>, felt similarly about having your iPhone out while getting your hair done.&nbsp;“Not only does the phone physically get in the way of the service you’re receiving, it is distracting to your stylist and to clients enjoying their salon time.”</p>
<p>If you’re getting a manicure, <a href=""http://opi.com/"" target=""_blank"">OPI</a> Ambassador Elsa Barbi agreed that phones can take away from the experience. “It’s difficult,” she explains, “to perform a service when [a client’s] hands are occupied with a magazine or cell phone.”</p>
<p>Pedicures, however, are a different story. Seeing as your hands aren’t occupied, feel free to text everyone on your contact list or hop on a quick call (just don’t be loud).</p>
<hr>
<h2>Leave your friend at home.</h2>
<p>Sorry, but unless your BFF is also getting a service done, leave her or him at home.</p>
<p>“If you are with a friend, you’re moving your head back and forth during conversation without realizing it, making it less efficient and harder to work around,” Solano explained. “With no obstacles to work around, we can get you on your way with the perfect look and style quickly!”</p>
<hr>
<h2>Chatting is always welcome.</h2>
<p>No need to awkwardly stare at the floor when getting your hair or nails did.</p>
<p>Skyy Hadley, owner of <a href=""http://www.asuwishnailspa.com/"" target=""_blank"">As U Wish Nail Spa</a>, loves to chat with her clients especially if they’re regulars.&nbsp;“Most of my clients come in every week so it’s nice to catch up with them and hear about what they have going on in their personal lives.”</p>
<p>Barbi likened nail techs to therapists, which beats having to pay a small fortune for a session.</p>
<p>“Sometimes clients just want to sit in their chair and relax and then sometimes we get clients who just can’t stop talking. Either way, we need to be flexible and adapt to what they want. I must caution though; listen more than offer advice, you never know who knows who.”</p>
<p>Solano agreed that chatting with a client is a perk, but it’s important to wait until your stylist isn’t extremely busy. “I recommend feeling out how busy or engaged the stylist is in that moment – based on how concentrated they need to be. I feel the perfect balance includes a mix of personal and beauty talk – leaving enough time for us to give you those great hair tips!”</p>
<p>The golden rule?</p>
<p>“I was always taught to never engage in conversations about politics or religion,” Barbi warned.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Chipotle can wait.</h2>
<p>Grab takeout on your way home, not at the salon.</p>
<p>Martino insisted that not only is eating improper etiquette, but it’s also “unsanitary while in a sterile medical environment.” Some treatments (like <a href=""http://www.skinneymedspa.com/coolsculpting/"" target=""_blank"">Coolsculpting</a>), however, take around two hours to complete and clients are welcome to order lunch while catching up on Netflix or Apple TV.</p>
<p>For Solano, eating at the salon follows the same rule your workplace does. “If you need to eat, please consider not choosing something smelly or sloppy!” AKA no burritos.</p>
<p>“I prefer that a client isn’t eating while receiving a manicure service,” Barbi agreed. “It makes it difficult between switching hands and asking them to sanitize their hands between bites.”</p>
<hr>
<h2>If you’re unhappy, speak up.</h2>
<p>This is the one place where if you don’t have something nice to say, you should say it anyway.</p>
<p>Barbi insisted that if a client is unhappy, it’s important to share that they’re uncomfortable or don’t like something. Conversely, it’s important for the technician to check in and educate their client on what’s currently going on.</p>
<p>Hadley agreed that clients should always voice any issues because it’s easier to fix something halfway than having to finish a manicure or pedicure only to have someone be displeased with her work.</p>
<p>“If it’s something I can fix, it’s much better for me to know at the beginning of the service before I repeat it on every nail,” she explains. “For example, if they don’t like the color they chose, I am totally fine removing it from a few nails rather than finishing the manicure or pedicure and then having them tell me they don’t like.”</p>
<p>Martino sums it up well,&nbsp;“Communication and understanding the full process is best, so speak up! You’ll be happy you did.”</p>
<hr>
<h2>Birthday suits are welcome.</h2>
<p>If you’re uncomfortable stripping down to your skivvies, Martino recommends sticking to one esthetician or technician that makes you feel most at ease.&nbsp;“After the first session, 95 percent of clients feel completely comfortable,” Martino recalls.</p>
<p>If you’re one of the five&nbsp;percent that isn’t, SKINNEY Medspa and other salons carry disposable panties and robes, perfect for keeping all your lady bits covered.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Don’t feel bad about bringing your own stuff.</h2>
<p>“I respect clients who bring their own tools,” Barbi explained. “This means that their health is important to them.”</p>
<p>Solano allows her clients to bring their own products within reason. If you have allergies and don’t want to risk using something new, feel free to bring your own <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/LOreal-Paris-Elnett-Hairspray-Unscented/dp/B006DWF3F6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437157764&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=hairspray+elnett"" target=""_blank"">hairspray</a> (or whatever). If there’s a certain treatment you’re on, stick to it and bring it in.</p>
<p>Tools are a different story.</p>
<p>“I like to think we spend a lot of time doing our research as professionals to choose the best tools for the health and texture of your hair,” Solano advised. “When someone brings in their favorite brush, I find it’s usually not the best for their hair type.”</p>
<hr>
<h2>Don’t be a Neanderthal.</h2>
<p>Practice basic human hygiene prior to heading to the spa. Your date is most likely not going to be impressed with your two-week-old unshaved legs, and neither will your technician.</p>
<p>“Definitely shave before coming in,” Martino recommends.</p>
<p>If you were trying to squeeze-in a&nbsp;last-minute spin class prior to laser hair removal, be sure to at least shower beforehand. If there’s no time, use a cleansing wipe (which SKINNEY carries) and wipe down prior to starting your treatment.</p>
<p>Remember, just because you’re going to leave looking pretty, doesn’t mean you should come in looking like a grizzly bear.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/HairStylist-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/the-newest-disturbing-beauty-product/,Beauty,The Newest Disturbing Beauty Product,"<p>There are multiple disturbing and questionable beauty treatments in this world. It seems as if women are easily bored, or not as impressed, as they once were by standard, and normal beauty practices.</p>
<p>Just think about Kim Kardashian’s blood facial, or the newest stem cell facial. So strange, and in my opinion, so unnecessary. DO you really need all of that shit? Probably not.</p>
<p>Now, the world has officially lost their mind, seeing as this new beauty product is the strangest I’ve ever heard of. The newest beauty product I’m talking about is made with sheep’s placenta.</p>
<p>Yup. Sheep, as in the animal, and their afterbirth. The embryonic sack serum craze started in Beverly Hills (of course) and has attracted celebrity clients such as Victoria Beckham (come on girlfriend) and Simon Cowell.</p>
<p>The product is slathered on during a particular sheep placenta facial treatment. The product is apparently clear and smells like vinegar (gagging) and is apart of a process in which you also get a slathering of stem cell concentrate, microdermabrasion and red light therapy.</p>
<p>Dermatologist experts are split on the actual effectiveness of the treatment (stem cells can reverse the signs of aging, however, they need to be stored and harvested in specific ways in order to do so), the treatment is definitely animal-friendly: The serum is derived from sheep placentas that were once discarded after meat slaughter.</p>
<p>Oh, good. If you don’t mind, I’m going to sit this bad boy out.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/bikinis-banned-from-miss-world-competition/,Beauty,Bikinis Banned from Miss World Competition,"<p>For many, the Miss World Bikini Competition serves the same purpose as the Victoria’s Secret fashion show: men are able to watch women half-naked on national television, while women are able to starve themselves for a week after watching it in hopes of losing 20 lbs. The organizers of the competition, which will be held in Indonesia this year, are trying to change this.</p>
<p><strong>Hary Tanoesoedibjo</strong>, the owner of Indonesia’s biggest media company MNC group and organizer of the competition, feels that the event has been too concentrated on physical beauty in the past and on objectifying women.</p>
<p>Blinded by bikinis, viewers forget that the competition is supposed showcase inner qualities of these women: intelligence, leadership and success. So instead, this year the bathing suit competition will be limited to one pieces that focus more on the fashion design of the suits and accompanying beachwear accessories.</p>
<p>While this decreases the sexual objectification of women, does it help to show anything about their “inner” qualities? What is the purpose of competing for the appeal of beachwear accessories if the goal of the organizers is to steer away from the shallow, physical focus that the bathing suit competition brings?</p>
<p><strong>Donald Trump</strong>, who owns the Miss Universe competition, disagrees with the changes in the bathing suit competition for different reasons. He predicts that Miss World ratings will drop heavily after women are no longer displayed in their bikinis. Sexist? Maybe a little.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind omitting bikinis from the bathing suit competition this year, however, may not stem purely from feminism. In fact, quite opposite: the Miss World competition also announced they they would ban bikinis from the competition in order to respect the religious views of the Muslim population in Indonesia, where the competition will take place.</p>
<p>While the majority of Indonesia is Muslim, there is no national religion set up by the government and there are various other minority religions within the nation. Other protestors of these changes feel that they are just trying to show the world that women should be covered up.</p>
<p>It should be interesting to see how the public reacts to these changes in the bathing suit competition when Miss World airs this year. What is the truth behind these changes? Is Miss World standing up for women by not allowing them to wear bikinis, or keeping them trapped by old-fashioned religious restrictions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04150906/Stocksy_txp7d116002unW000_Small_447821-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/the-best-nail-polish-for-your-skin-tone/,Beauty,The Best Nail Polish For Your Skin Tone,"<p>Certain colors look best on certain females. When it comes to makeup, we should never be using any shades that aren’t going to completely complement our skin tone and make us look amazing. After all, makeup is meant to enhance our natural beauty.</p>
<p>Nail polish is meant to do exactly the same. We’ve all had those moments when we’ve painted our nails a certain color and have stepped back and said “ew, absolutely not.”</p>
<p>When that happens, it’s because you have chosen a polish that doesn’t necessarily complement your skin tone, which will, of course, not help you enhance your natural beauty.</p>
<p>To prevent this from happening ever again, here are the polish shades you should focus on when it comes to your skin tone:</p>
<p>If you have&nbsp;<strong>red or pink undertones</strong>&nbsp;like <strong>Cameron Diaz</strong>, who suffers from rosacea, steer clear from polish colors that have the same tone in them—it will enhance the red in your skin. Opt for more feminine sheer, soft shades instead. And if you’re looking for a dark hue, go for navy instead of black. Try:</p>
<p>butter LONDON Fairy Lights Nail Lacquer&nbsp;($15)</p>
<p>Pop Beauty Nail Glam Nail Polish in Baby Blue($10)</p>
<p>If you have&nbsp;<strong>fair skin</strong>&nbsp;like<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Anne Hathaway</strong>, try using lighter shades of lacquer with pink or blue undertones and avoid colors that are too beige or too dark. Try:</p>
<p>SpaRitual Nail Lacquer in Thunder Road&nbsp;($12)</p>
<p>SpaRitual Nail Lacquer in Lucid&nbsp;($8.40)</p>
<p>Lucky enough to have gorgeous&nbsp;<strong>tan skin&nbsp;</strong>like Jennifer Aniston and&nbsp;<strong>Jessica Simpson</strong>? Avoid gold and brassy hues, as they tend to lose vibrancy against tanned skin and will come out looking dull. Try:</p>
<p>SpaRitual Nail Lacquer in Spice of Life ($12)</p>
<p>SpaRitual Nail Lacquer in Disco Inferno&nbsp;($10)</p>
<p><strong>Medium skin tones</strong>&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;<strong>Kim Kardashian</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>have the best options when it comes to polish shades. Choose from a range of shades like dark burgundy and metallic to black, as well as vibrant colors like pink, blue, yellow and orange. Try:</p>
<p>NARS Nail Polish in Kismet&nbsp;($19)</p>
<p>butter LONDON Nail Lacquer&nbsp;($15)</p>
<p>If you have a<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>medium dark to dark complexion</strong>&nbsp;like&nbsp;<strong>Kerry Washington</strong>, choose deep shades like vibrant oranges, purples or reds. Try to avoid pale pastel shades, which will make you look washed out. Try:</p>
<p>Essie Nail Polish in Fifth Avenue&nbsp;($8)</p>
<p>NARS Nail Polish in Purple Rain&nbsp;($19)</p>
<p>If you have an&nbsp;<strong>olive skin tone</strong>&nbsp;like&nbsp;<strong>Mila Kunis</strong>,&nbsp;avoid anything&nbsp;too&nbsp;pale, as it will make your skin look sallow. Choose colors with gold undertones instead, which will make your skin look brighter and more vibrant. Try:</p>
<p>butter LONDON Nail Lacquer in The Full Monthly&nbsp;($15)</p>
<p>butter LONDON Nail Lacquer in Dahling&nbsp;($15)</p>
<p>For&nbsp;<strong>darker complexions</strong>&nbsp;like&nbsp;<strong>Viola Davis</strong>, coffee-colored nudes with yellow or orange undertones are the best options. Try:</p>
<p>butter LONDON Nail Lacquer in Hen Party($15)</p>
<p>Essie Nail Polish in Tarte Deco&nbsp;($8)</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/what-matters-millennial-women-beauty/912531/,Beauty,Would You Rather? 10 Things That Actually Matter To Millennial Women,"<p>Learning to manage my spending is one of the hardest lessons I’ve had to struggle through as an adult, and living in New York sure doesn’t make it easy. Temptation is everywhere, and I’m certainly not the most responsible person when it comes to money.</p>
<p>I know I’m not alone in this, though. We all have our vices, be it shopping or splurging on a&nbsp;must-have beauty treatment, as indulgent as it may be.</p>
<p>Getting by with what we’ve got, however, means we have to prioritize, monitor our spending and sacrifice those oh-so-satisfying splurges accordingly.</p>
<p>We thought it would be interesting to see how these priorities stack up against one another: With the limited funds we <i>do</i> have, what do Millennials consider valuable enough to spend our precious dough on — and what do we (begrudgingly) give up?</p>
<p>So, we rounded up a list of “Would You Rather” questions, each pitting life experiences against popular (and pampering) beauty treatments, a common vice among the 20-something crowd.</p>
<p>We shared the survey via Twitter to garner a random pool of participants. After collecting the responses from anonymous participants, we got&nbsp;answers&nbsp;—&nbsp;and determined some pretty interesting truths about what actually&nbsp;matters to Millennial women.</p>
<p>Check out our results, below, and <a href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/RLRWTYD"" target=""_blank"">answer the survey</a> for yourself —&nbsp;you might just learn something about your own values in the meantime.</p>
<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>We were surprised to find in every single case the majority of respondents voted in favor of spending on life experiences rather than beauty treatments.</p>
<p>What’s more: These victories often won by a landslide (see graph above), revealing not only the majority, but the vast majority, of Millennials value memorable experiences and activities far more than the quest for physical perfection.</p>
<hr>
<p>When respondents did choose beauty treatments over the life experiences (as above, indicated by the split in responses), it tended to be for longer-lasting treatments — like highlights — than those likely to wear out quickly, like blowouts.</p>
<p>Perhaps, we see these longer-lasting treatments as investments of sorts, whereas we deem quick, temporary fixes unworthy of the financial commitment.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another pattern: Those beauty treatments we can do ourselves, like facials, lost&nbsp;out by a bigger percentage than those we can’t do ourselves, like highlights.</p>
<p>It seems we’re willing to&nbsp;DIY the beauty treatment (though the results may be poorer than if done professionally) so we can save money for&nbsp;more hands-on activities and social outings.</p>
<hr>
<p>No surprise here: Happy hour wins the majority (58 percent) of votes when pitted against the mani/pedi. We wonder how different these responses would be during the summer, for example — would more people choose Happy Hour because of the weather and access to outdoor bars?</p>
<p>Or would more prefer the mani/pedi because hands and feet will be on display?</p>
<hr>
<p>Fitness, we noticed, tended to be a very popular choice among Millennial women when pitted against beauty treatments.</p>
<p>Staying healthy and in shape seems to be a primary concern amongst all respondents, perhaps because health and fitness pay off more in the long run than beauty treatments do.</p>
<p>Plus, feeling&nbsp;fit gives way to feeling beautiful and self-confident, no beauty treatment necessary.</p>
<hr>
<p>This was one of the closest we conducted, which isn’t too surprising given it’s T Swift and all. Highlights are great, of course, and extremely popular — but, like everything else in life, Tay Tay always wins.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is perhaps the best evidence socializing (and booze!) <em>blows away&nbsp;</em>the beauty competition. We’d rather wash it down than wash it out.</p>
<hr>
<p>We admit this one&nbsp;could be a bit biased because, seriously, who really <em>wants</em> to get a bikini wax? Food&nbsp;always wins, especially in this case.</p>
<p>But this is another scenario, however, in which&nbsp;the poll results could change with the seasons.&nbsp;In the summer, we’re more inclined to go out (and more inclined to wear bathing suits) than we are now.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another case for the DIY: Though perma-straightened hair is undeniably appealing, it seems Millennials are willing to spend extra time each day straightening their strands in order to save up for a pricey splurge gadget.</p>
<p>If we can do it ourselves, we will (at least if it comes with an iPad).</p>
<hr>
<p>Netflix is a staple. Enough said.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151237/Stocksy_txp5029b5aajuW000_Small_400364-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/what-is-bb-cream-how-to-use-it/946270/,Beauty,Beauty’s Latest ‘It’ Buy: The Science Behind BB Cream,"<p>After realizing I’m in my mid-20s, with countless late nights and boozy endeavors appearing on my face, I need to start prepping my skin in the morning. Like a true rookie, I began with pumps of both moisturizer and foundation, mixing the creams in the palm of my hand and smearing it all over my face. This will work, I told myself.</p>
<p>But it didn’t occur to me I was doing anything wrong until my roommate suggested I simplify my routine with BB cream. It’s like the all-inclusive resort of skin coverage. But what exactly is BB cream?</p>
<p><em>How does it work? What’s in it? Why has it become such a crucial component in our everyday beauty maintenance? Is it just a fad or is it here to stay? And which should you buy?</em></p>
<p>BB creams have officially flooded the market — and everyone from Great-Aunt Terri to my 13-year-old cousin is carrying it around in her&nbsp;bag. It’s like the hot, new, trendy green juice. So naturally, I had to get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p>Here’s everything you need to know (the science and the satisfaction!) about beauty’s latest ‘It’ buy: BB Cream.</p>
<h2>A little history lesson:</h2>
<p>BB stands for “Blemish Balm.” Once upon a time, <a href=""http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/29/vain-glorious-bb-creams-are-here/?_r=0"" target=""_blank"">German dermatologist</a> Dr. Christine Schrammek developed the cream to protect and soothe her patients’ skin after chemical peels.</p>
<p>It first gained commercial appeal in Asia, where a blemish is looked at as <em>any</em> sort of skin discoloration (skin tone, age spots, sun spots, etc.), not necessarily just acne. It was touted for its “porcelain skin” effects.</p>
<p>Soon, BB cream was picked up by Western&nbsp;markets and became extremely popular in the United States. In spring 2011, it was all over the US market and had even taken on a far more appealing name: “Beauty Balm.”</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why&nbsp;it’s worth every bit of the hype:</h2>
<p>BB cream <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/beauty/makeup/beauty-balms-bb-creams"" target=""_blank"">provides a combination of skin benefits</a>&nbsp;you’d&nbsp;normally get when using five or six different products. Instead of needing an endless supply of creams and lotions, BB does all the work fro you. It evens your skin tone, hydrates your skin, provides sun protection, works as a concealer and provides your body with antioxidants from vitamins C and D, which help combat signs of aging.</p>
<p>Unlike tinted moisturizer (which simply provides minimal coverage with lotion properties) or foundation (which is more makeup than Rx, unless you find one with specific add-ins), this well-rounded Beauty Balm provides more benefits for&nbsp;your face than any other cream on the market.</p>
<p>Makeup artist<a href=""https://instagram.com/badgirl_beatty/"" target=""_blank"">&nbsp;Sarah-Jane Beatty</a> of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sjmuartistry"" target=""_blank"">Sarah-Jane Makeup Artistry</a>&nbsp;agrees, saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>BB cream is your all-in-one beauty item, containing versatile coverage in one easy-to-apply product. No brush required, you can spread a sheer coat over your skin for a natural and effortless look.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>So, how the hell do you work it into your morning routine?:</h2>
<p>OK, we know BB cream sounds overwhelming, but it’s pretty&nbsp;simple to use. You don’t need a brush or a special sponge; you just&nbsp;apply&nbsp;it to&nbsp;your face with your fingers. Kim Roberts, the <a href=""http://www.kiehls.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-kiehls_us-Site/default/Page-Show?cid=desktop-special-offers&amp;cm_mmc=LabeliumSearch-_-GoogleBrand-_-Kiehls+Brand-_-kiehls%20usa&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQiA37CnBRChp7e-pM2Mzp0BEiQAlSxQCBzAHsdnr6Cqio8C86dfRe9ok-zxT2jaLNDQqNuAEGkaAqUM8P8HAQ&amp;bookmark=519904"" target=""_blank"">Director of Customer Experience at Kiehl’s</a>, adds,</p>
<blockquote><p>It speeds up your morning routine by giving you Vitamin C antioxidant protection, SPF sun protection, all-day hydration, and pigmented coverage in one simple step.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, if you don’t feel like arduously painting your face&nbsp;to look like an airbrushed Kardashian, BB&nbsp;cream is the prime&nbsp;product to take you from bed-to-beautiful in a matter of seconds. And since you’re using it in place of products, your routine might even be shorter.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;you’re still having separation anxiety from your favorite foundation, Roberts suggests to follow your regular skincare routine with BB Cream, then add foundation. “Layering gives you all-day coverage for the longest days.”</p>
<hr>
<h2>What you should look for before you buy:</h2>
<p>Beatty suggests looking for BB creams with SPF, vitamins like C and E, and antioxidants from green tea or other natural extracts. The more you’re getting from your product, the better it’s doing for your body. Beatty adds,</p>
<blockquote><p>Hyaluronic acid is added to many products as an anti-aging agent and salicylic acid may be found in some to keep breakouts under control.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here’s the icing on the cake: A good BB cream can actually help&nbsp;<em>improve</em> your skin over time. Yep, it isn’t just covering up the blemishes; it’s actually working <em>for</em> your skin.</p>
<p>The key is to look for the purest ingredients and make sure you’re getting the highest&nbsp;SPF possible.</p>
<hr>
<h2>So, should you shell out the dough or play it safe?</h2>
<p>Even though&nbsp;you’re used to grabbing the Cetaphil and getting the heck out of CVS, you can’t get away with going the budget route for BB cream. (Sorry.)</p>
<p>When it come to your Beauty Balm, both Roberts and Beatty suggest making an investment and going for a more expensive brand. You’ll be glad you did (even if your bank account isn’t). As Beatty puts it,</p>
<blockquote><p>The&nbsp;difference between all drugstore vs. luxury brand makeup is the more expensive brands use purer ingredients and less fillers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Beatty suggests <a href=""http://www.sephora.com/diorskin-nude-bb-creme-P377753"" target=""_blank"">Dior Diorskin Nude BB Creme</a> ($45) while Roberts recommends <a href=""http://www.kiehls.com/BB-Cream-Actively-Correcting-and-Beautifying-with-SPF-50-PA/1201,default,pd.html"" target=""_blank"">Kiehl’s Skin Tone Correcting &amp; Beautifying BB Cream SPF 50</a> ($37).</p>
<p>Moral of the story: You pay more for better-quality ingredients. And since your BB cream is the first layer&nbsp;applied to&nbsp;your skin, it’s important to use a&nbsp;wholesome product that makes you feel as good as you look.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151354/Stocksy_txpa92d3c793gW000_Small_338631-800x400.jpg
http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/glamsquad-at-home-essie-manicure-service/1020246/,Beauty,This At-Home Manicure Service Is So Easy You’ll Never Have To Leave Home,"<p>There’s only one downside to a professional manicure: You’re generally expected to change out of pajamas and leave your apartment.</p>
<p>The days of staring out of&nbsp;storefronts and waiting aimlessly for your nails to dry are now over thanks to <a href=""http://www.glamsquad.com/how-it-works/"" target=""_blank"">beauty-booking app</a> GLAMSQUAD’s new partnership with polish maven&nbsp;Essie.</p>
<p>Manicure-lovers in New York (soon to be followed by Los Angeles and Miami) need only grab their iPhones&nbsp;to&nbsp;order an in-house nail treatment from a professional. (And a free hand to microwave last night’s leftover pizza.)</p>
<p>At $35 per&nbsp;polish&nbsp;($55 for two), manicures may not be as inexpensive as they are in the&nbsp;dimly-lit place you sometimes go to in the East Village. But, for a wedding&nbsp;or a busy day (or when you just want to treat yo’ self), getting <a href=""https://instagram.com/p/hvz4wzntH_/"" target=""_blank"">the Gisele treatment</a> in the comfort of your own home is worth a splurge.</p>
<p>A pedicure will run you&nbsp;$50, while the&nbsp;full mani-pedi service&nbsp;is&nbsp;$75.</p>
<p>There’s no word on whether those massive, vibrating massage chairs are part of the deal, but a girl can dream, right?</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/really-like-behind-scenes-miss-america/1016145/,Beauty,What It’s Really Like Behind The Scenes At Miss America,"<p>Being able to afford college is not easy. Making a difference in the world is no piece of cake, either.</p>
<p>For nearly a century, the Miss America Organization has been giving money to women who make an impact in their communities to help offset the costs of secondary education.</p>
<p>But, in order to win that coveted check and title, there’s a ton of behind-the-scenes preparation that goes into it all.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;pageant girl is more than glitz and glitter; she is responsible for representing the fundamentals of leadership.</p>
<p>Any woman between the ages of 17 and 24 who doesn’t have children yet and who lives, works or goes to school in the appropriate region is eligible to compete.</p>
<p>You just have to want it bad enough and be willing to do weird things with butt glue.</p>
<p>Here’s what the world of pageantry is really all about:</p>
<h2>Before The Pageant</h2>
<p><b>The Paperwork</b></p>
<p>Usually this includes a fact sheet, contract, a list of community service activities and a personal platform statement.</p>
<p>This platform is an issue each competitor values the most, like the importance of blood donation or inspiring social action.</p>
<p><b>The Wardrobe</b></p>
<p>This is important because it defines who you are before you say a word. A stylish interview outfit says, “I am ready for the job, and proactive to make a change in my community.”</p>
<p>A unique gown says, “I’m not afraid&nbsp;to stand out and take risks to increase the public’s perspective.”</p>
<p>Even the swimsuit is important and can tell the audience, “I’m confident in my body and my sassy attitude is what it takes to make things happen.”</p>
<p><b>The Fundraising </b></p>
<p>This is a portion many people don’t often know about. All local competitors are required to raise $100 per pageant to be donated to the Miss America for Kids Organization.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with an entry fee, this money is divided between Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, the Miss America Scholarship Organization and the local pageant’s scholarship fund.</p>
<p>So, once the paperwork is sent in and the garment bags are packed, the day&nbsp;will&nbsp;finally arrive. Pageant day is one thing after another, building anticipation until that last&nbsp;moment arrives.</p>
<p>Not sure what to expect? The day might go something like this:</p>
<hr>
<h2>Pageant Day</h2>
<p>The morning of the pageant is spent rehearsing walking patterns, routines and scripts. This time is also a bonding period between the ladies.</p>
<p>Rehearsals are interrupted for the private interviews. Contestants have 10-minute private interviews with the panel of five to seven judges, which provides the personal time to allow judges to get to know each lady.</p>
<p>For nine minutes and 30 seconds, the judges can ask anything related to the fact sheet and platform statement, as well as current events, and both regional and generic questions.</p>
<p>At the end of that time, each contestant has 30 seconds for a closing statement to tie up loose ends, thank the judges and get them excited for the night ahead.</p>
<p>This portion constitutes&nbsp;20 percent of the total score, so it is important to earn as many points as possible during this first impression.</p>
<p>There is usually a dress rehearsal to help provide&nbsp;an idea of how things move, as well as how much time is available to&nbsp;change outfits between categories.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Show</h2>
<p>Finally it is time for the show, and backstage turns into&nbsp;a hot mess. Hair is curled, lashes are extended and tattoos are covered.</p>
<p>Vocalists begin their warm ups, dancers use the hallways to stretch and the pep talks begin.</p>
<p>Everyone’s&nbsp;ready.</p>
<p>The competitors are first introduced during the opening number. A simple dance routine without any official scoring allows the audience and judges a preview of the night.</p>
<p>During this portion, each lady has a few moments at the mic to introduce herself, as well as her hometown, school and personal platform. Although this is not a scored category, it just might spark the interest of the judges.</p>
<p>The first judged category of the on stage portion is the lifestyle and fitness section, worth 15 percent.</p>
<p>This allows the ladies to show off their healthy lifestyles. It is not about how skinny someone is, but rather how confident she is in her&nbsp;body.</p>
<p>The ladies actually glue their bikini bottoms using butt glue to prevent thong wedgies while on stage. Remarkably, many girls use Elmer’s Spray Glue that stays on for weeks, tearing away at the&nbsp;flesh each day.</p>
<p>The better option is a water soluble roll-on adhesive found at medical supply stores. Backstage, it isn’t rare to find an assembly line of girls waiting to get glued before running down the hall.</p>
<p>The girls take their turns on stage before returning to the dressing room to prepare for the heaviest&nbsp;weighted category: talent.</p>
<p>Worth 35 percent of the total score, each contestant has 90 seconds to showcase her personal talent. As with&nbsp;any competition, it is important to stand out.</p>
<p>The high glory and elegance of the competition is the evening gown portion. Backstage, the ladies update&nbsp;their hair to simple up-dos, darken their lipstick and even&nbsp;use duct tape to keep their boobs&nbsp;up.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.5;"">This last major portion is worth 20 percent of the total score.</span></p>
<p>At this point, the evening is coming to an end, but it’s not over yet. In effort to give the audience a sample of the morning’s interview, the ladies must return to the stage to receive the final 5 percent of their scores: the on-stage question.</p>
<p>Each contestant chooses a question, which are usually opinion-based and about major controversial topics.</p>
<p>The contestant isn’t expected to solve the problem, but rather have a concise opinion on the matter and a rough understanding of what can be done to solve it.</p>
<p>It is important to pause before starting, speak clearly and avoid&nbsp;rambling. After thanking the judges, the contestant steps back and exits the stage.</p>
<p>Now it’s&nbsp;time for crowning.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Crowning</h2>
<p>The number of contestants determines the number of runners up. If a winner should be unable to fill her role, the first runner up will take over the responsibility.</p>
<p>When the winner’s name is announced, there is an eruption&nbsp;of cheers.</p>
<p>She steps forward to center stage, where previous the titleholder, usually with the help of the reigning Outstanding Teen, will give the new winner a beautiful bouquet, an official Miss America sash and the crown.</p>
<p>Her year begins that night. With the help of many sponsors, she will spend the next few months preparing for the state pageant and making appearances to promote Miss America Organization, her platform and the local pageant system.</p>
<p>It’s trite to say, but everyone&nbsp;walks away a winner. Even those who do not walk away with a crown could leave with great prizes and scholarship money by winning supplementary awards.</p>
<p>The prizes are not wads of cash, as seen&nbsp;in “Honey Boo Boo.” This is a scholarship organization, and the awards are paid out directly to the contestant’s college office or student loan agency.</p>
<p>Awards may be given out for the academic excellence, dedication to community service or the highest points in a specific phase of competition.</p>
<p>The Miss Congeniality award is decided by the contestants themselves. After spending time together, they vote for the contestant&nbsp;they felt was the kindest and most helpful.</p>
<p>Contestants who exceed the minimum $100 donation to Children’s Miracle Network are also eligible for the Miracle Maker Award, given to the contestant who raised the most.</p>
<p>But only one wins the crown.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pageant-800x400.jpg

<p>After such a harsh winter and a muted palette, summer feeds our eyes and noses as much as it does our need for change. It’s only fitting, then, that one of the greatest joys of the season comes from&nbsp;breaking out the brightest, most beautiful colors.</p>
<p>Gone are the blue jeans, replaced by botanical prints and wildly-colored lipsticks.</p>
<p>And, of course, no summer is complete without the perfect shade of nail polish.</p>
<p>Whether you roast&nbsp;on a beach towel or hide your pale skin under a wide-brimmed hat, a&nbsp;manicure pulls your seasonal look together.</p>
<p>As <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/women/5-diy-nail-art-designs-for-the-non-artist-photos/1043312/"" target=""_blank"">well-documented</a> polish <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/envision/nail-polish-changes-color-with-mood/1040661/"" target=""_blank"">fiends</a>, we weren’t about to let the summer slip away without testing out the best shades for a variety of skin tones.

<p>Fair skin (and shorter nails) calls for a deep red shade, leading us to chose Smith &amp; Cult’s blogger-favored polish&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.smithandcult.com/kundalini-hustle.html"" target=""_blank"">Kundalini Hustle</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on vampy colors, warmer skin tones&nbsp;should try&nbsp;a polish that’s bright, like Essie’s <a href=""http://www.essie.com/Colors/Reds/fifth-avenue.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Fifth Avenue</a>.</p>
<p>And, on dark skin, an orange-toned shade like <a href=""http://opi.com/color/nail-lacquer/aloha-opi"" target=""_blank"">Aloha From OPI</a> really pops. As the name might suggest, it’s the ideal color to take with you on a tropical vacation.</p>

<p>Has any pink ever been as perfect as the ubiquitous lawn flamingo? Smith &amp; Cult did its best to capture that very shade&nbsp;in <a href=""http://www.smithandcult.com/plastic-beach.html"" target=""_blank"">Plastic Beach</a>, a guava-inspired color we felt popped&nbsp;best on fair skin.</p>
<p>For medium skin, the cool, light pink of Sonia Kashuk’s <a href=""http://soniakashuk.com/products/love-story-2/"" target=""_blank"">Love Story</a> creates an eye-catching contrast at a bargain price.</p>
<p>Finally, the magenta hues of Topshop’s <a href=""http://www.topshop.com/en/tsuk/product/nails-in-wonderland-4297338"" target=""_blank"">Nails in Wonderland</a> brought an effortless cool to our dark-skinned model’s fingertips. When it doubt, edge towards purple.</p>

<p>Nude polishes are a chance to highlight the best notes in every skin color, which is why they’re so universally flattering.

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/minute-hairstyles/,Beauty,Five Last Minute Hairstyles,"<p>Some days I wake up and I’m instantly energetic, eager to spend time blowing out or curling my hair. Other days, I wake up completely against my will and procrastinate for 45 minutes, lying in bed staring at my ceiling.</p>
<p>On days like this I punish myself by leaving ten minutes to get ready. Thankfully, messy, last minute hairstyles are quick and always in fashion. Sometimes, these styles look better to me than a polished blow out.</p>
<p><strong>The Sock Bun</strong></p>
<p>A trend that has been seen literally <em>everywhere</em> this year. This is such an effortless style and tutorials are all over YouTube. The sock bun makes it look like it takes time and precision to achieve and really takes less than five minutes, what else can the girl on the go ask for?</p>
<p><strong>The Pony Tail</strong></p>
<p>A technique women everywhere have been using since childhood. Dress up the simple ponytail by wrapping a small piece of hair around the tie.</p>
<p><strong>The Braid</strong></p>
<p>Similar to the ponytail, just a little more exciting. With braids you’re not limited to one simple style. Various types of braids, such as fishtail and herringbone, are just as easy to execute.</p>
<p><strong>The Messy Bun</strong></p>
<p>This is my absolute go to last minute hairstyle. A lot of tutorials on YouTube try to explain “steps” needed to achieve this look. I’ve always found that throwing your hair back and tying a bun together as quickly and thoughtlessly as possible, looks best.</p>
<p><strong>Embracing Your Natural Hair</strong></p>
<p>Accept your natural hair texture and simply let it do it’s own thing. Messy is in after all.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/skin-care-dos-donts/,Beauty,Skin Care Do’s And Don’ts,"<p>We all make skincare mistakes. Whether it’s forgetting to cleanse our skin or sleeping with our make up on, most of the time we forget to treat our skin with the care and effort we should, which stops our skin from looking its best.</p>
<p>Lets admit it – it’s easy to skip these skincare steps; but how much are we really damaging our skin by skipping said steps? There are a few easy rules we should follow to maintain smooth, firm and fresh looking skin.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do: Drink plenty of water. </strong></p>
<p>You have probably heard it hundreds of times before, but its true. Water is an essential for healthy looking skin as it flushes out toxins and keeps the complexion hydrated. Drinking eight glasses a day is vital for fresh looking skin. &nbsp;<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Do: Use a nighttime face lotion.</strong></p>
<p>Applying a serum or lotion at night will let the skin repair and allow the moisture to soak in and heal the skin. &nbsp;Applying lotion at night can improve the healthy and beauty of your skin.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t</strong>: <strong>Use harsh scrubs on your skin.</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Avoid scrubs that are too harsh for your skin. Exfoliating once or twice a week is good, but over-doing it will irritate your skin and cause you to break out.</p>
<p><strong>Do: Wash your skin at night.</strong></p>
<p>Don’t slip into the habit of getting into bed without washing your face. Make up can clog your pores and cause breakouts; something we all want to avoid.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t: </strong><strong>drink too much coffee.</strong></p>
<p>While a cup a day— minus whipped cream, extra sugar etc, sugar may be beneficial; too much coffee can be dehydrating.</p>
<p>Keeping to these skincare steps will work wonders for the skin. Although its simple, its every girls secret to effortless skin.</p>
<p>What is your best-kept skincare secret?</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/semen-hair-treatments/,Beauty,Semen Hair Treatments,"<p>Women have been known to go to unreasonable lengths to achieve beauty, but this latest trend has me cringing and shocked beyond disbelief.</p>
<p>A salon in Santa Monica California, called TheBroot, is now specializing in all-natural hair masks. Seems reasonable, except for the fact that a shot of bull semen can be added to their hair treatment if their clients are interested in “animal style” treatments.</p>
<p>Apparently, TheBroot salon owner Samira Asemanfar has said that bull semen strengthens the hair shaft and promotes hair growth. Um, ew. The salon boils down bull testies to a broth and then adds an ounce of it to your hair treatment for a mere $7.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I want to know the answer to this question, but would you be willing to try this treatment?</p>

The 24-year-old founded the Kirsten Haglund Foundation in February of 2009 with a mission to fundraise and provide treatment scholarships in order to assist families and individuals battling eating disorders.</strong></p>
<p>She is also active in volunteering with One Hundred Days, an organization based in Atlanta that is building Rwanda’s first children’s hospital, and creating small business initiatives in the Kigali community. Kirsten graduates in May 2013 with a B.A. in Political Science from Emory University.</p>
<p><strong>Growing up you wanted to become a professional ballerina, but along with keeping up with your dance routines, you had to do the same for your measurements. How did this effect you as a young girl?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Ballet is highly competitive and the body ideal is unnaturally thin. My passion for ballet led me to want to excel, not only technically, but also in conforming to the idea body type for a dancer.</p>
<p>Out of fear that gaining weight could prevent me from dance opportunities or even a career in ballet, I decided that I needed to be thin, whatever the cost – that was when I began the “diet” that became an eating disorder.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>What kinds of difficulties did you encounter when dealing with anorexia at a young age?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Starving yourself is not fun – it is not a “lifestyle” or a “phase,” it is an all-consuming, obsessive disease that only succeeds in making you hungry, depressed, isolated and angry. The thinner I became, the fatter I felt, the harder I became on myself to pursue perfection.</p>
<p>But thinness never satisfies, and it doesn’t make people love you – it drives them away because you become, and I became, a shell of your former self. Not to mention your body starts shutting down – cold all the time, losing hair, fatigue – anorexia is the most deadly mental illness, especially for adolescents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""http://elitedaily.com/2013/america-opens-eating-disorder/kh5/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-172376""></a></p>
<p><strong>Not many people are able to defeat their eating disorder, what or who helped you to overcome yours</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><strong></strong> I am incredibly thankful that my parents and professionals intervened when I was still in denial to force me into treatment. It wasn’t easy, but after two years of outpatient treatment with a physician, nutritionist and psychologist, I learned to want a life outside my eating disorder.</p>
<p>Learning about food and how it is fuel to take me places and help me to think, run, laugh, cry and love was the most important thing. From there, I focused on identifying the triggers of my low self-esteem and body-image, and learned ways I could accept what I could not control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What was the turning point in your life that led you to your current direction?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Recovery and finding my voice over the period of two years in therapy, and then my job as Miss America really helped me to see that my story and who I was was valuable, not due to any inherent greatness but just due to authenticity and openness.</p>
<p>Everyone has struggled with something, but is given that struggle in order to help and comfort others who later may go through the same thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""http://elitedaily.com/2013/america-opens-eating-disorder/kh4/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-179671""></a></p>
<p><strong>You started your own foundation, www.kirstenhaglund.org and you do several speaking engagements with the National Eating Disorder Association, what made you become involved with this?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I started my Foundation in 2009 in an effort to give back to families and individuals who are trying to get treatment for this illness. We raise awareness and funds for treatment.</p>
<p>I also speak, write and advocate as Community Relations Specialist for Timberline Knolls, a residential treatment center. I just wanted to continue giving back and encouraging people who have been affected by body hatred and eating disorders to have hope – that recovery and freedom is possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>You are former Miss America 2008, during competition, how did you handle the pressure from media and your peers to maintain your weight?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>As Miss America, having a camera on you all of the time and being considered by many as the American “ideal,” the pressure is implied. I quickly realized though, that there is no “ideal” — everyone has a very different opinion on what kind of body or face is beautiful.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>That means, you cannot possibly please everyone. That is very freeing. That left me able to just be myself, and do the best that I could every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""http://elitedaily.com/2013/america-opens-eating-disorder/kh2-2/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-199093""></a><a href=""http://elitedaily.com/2013/america-opens-eating-disorder/khhh/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-199089""><br>
</a></p>
<p><strong>There was a study done by the Klarman Eating Disorder that found that young girls were more afraid of becoming overweight than losing a parent or cancer. Why do you think younger girls are becoming more and more self conscious of their bodies?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>This makes me so sad because women, now more than ever, have so many opportunities – to do, to go, to accomplish more than any generation of women in history. And yet, we are still confined, or allow ourselves to be confined, by one standard of beauty – one the media oftentimes is responsible for creating.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href=""http://elitedaily.com/2013/america-opens-eating-disorder/kh2/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-199091""><br>
</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I am not saying a girl can’t wear makeup or cute clothes, just don’t make it your idol. Girls hear the message earlier and earlier that to be a woman is to be on a diet, not like your thighs, and swear off carbs – so that is what they do, earlier and earlier.</p>
<p>They see their moms doing it. And they see celebrities doing it, and celebrities are adored. Girls want to be loved and adored – so they think if they’re thin they’ll be loved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"">Five, 10, 50 years down the line when you’ve achieved everything you aspire for today, where do you see yourself?</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t make 10 year plans anymore, because life often has something much more fabulous in mind.&nbsp;<span style=""font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"">For example, I never planned or dreamed of being Miss America, but am absolutely so glad that it happened and it changed my life for the better.</span></p>
<p>So in 10 years, I just want to be able to do what I love, helping women, maybe have a family, travel and have joy. But to be joyful is a choice, not a result of circumstances – so wherever I may be, I can tell you with certainty that I will be happy.</p></blockquote>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/names-opi-polishes/,Beauty,Who Actually Names OPI Polishes?,"<p>OPI is one of America’s most commonly used nail polish brands. Not only is the formula of their product rich and opaque, but also their colors are bright, fun and always feature a perfectly punny name.</p>
<p>So, who actually gets the honor of naming these unique polishes? Is it a creative team? What about the person who mixes the colors to begin with? Well, a little of both.</p>
<p>Suzi Weiss-Fischmann, the co-founder of OPI and artistic director of the company, is the brains of the operation. Her process is fairly simple. Suzi first creates all of the shades. Then, she sits down in a boardroom with six others to get some creative inspiration.</p>
<p>The color inspiration for each polish collection usually comes from fashion trends from Paris and Milan fashion weeks, and themes of collections run alongside what’s current in pop culture.</p>
<p>Seems simple enough, no?</p>

<p>Spa treatments are pricey, but they’re often recommended. A facial each and every month is the recommended frequency. Facials are meant to purge your pores and clean out your skin better than your own skincare routine possibly can.</p>
<p>With the constant makeup application, and our active lifestyles, this sounds like an absolutely necessary process. But is it really? Post-facial, your skin breaks out, and sometimes, you can suffer from scars and bruising: remnants of the painful extraction process.</p>
<p>I currently have a bruise on the tip of my nose from such processes, and I’m not particularly pleased with this. Some women may argue that simply using good products throughout the year is enough to keep your skin deep cleaned.</p>
<p>Many of these women are also the women who hate the extractions. However, the truth of the matter is, no matter how pricey your products are, or how well you clean your skin on your own, your pores are truly not purged unless you undergo extractions.</p>
<p>Extractions can be done in your own home, of course, with the help of extraction tools that you can purchase from any drugstore, but there are some pesky plugged pores that we can’t reach on our own.</p>
<p>An outside view underneath a heavily magnified viewfinder is the only way to perfectly purge our skin. Although the process is painful, and pricey, I personally feel as if facials are a blessing.</p>
<p>What do you guys think? Would you be okay with getting regular facials, or are you just willing to do the dirty work yourself?</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/the-newest-trend-in-quirky-hair-color/,Beauty,The Newest Trend In Quirky Hair Color,"<p style=""text-align: center;"">
</p><p>It’s incredible to watch hair color trends come and go. As of late, trends have not been restricted to clothing and accessories: beauty trends are perhaps the most ever-changing trends out there.</p>
<p>Particularly, hair trends. No longer is it “weird” to have a… well, different, shade of hair color. Especially with this May’s release of The Costume Institute’s exhibit focusing on how punk music inspired high fashion, a quirky hair color is the new black.</p>
<p>Last year was the beginning of seeing pastel colored ends. Lauren Conrad frequently rocked the “My Little Pony” look, which was great to see, as her style wouldn’t normally reflect having pink, blue and purple hair.</p>
<p>So what’s the latest hair color trend? According to Ian Michael Black, Aveda’s global artistic director for hair color, Apricot. Black called the hair shade a “pastelized” version of copper. A combination of all of the current hair trends — pastel, ombre and red — all rolled into one.</p>
<p>The color apricot would be ideal for blondes to try red without going too dark or brassy in the process, and for redheads to get a taste of what blonde hair is like. Although many hair trends can be achieved via an at home, DIY project, this color would be best achieved by a professional colorist.</p>
<p>If you’d like to try this shade, tell your colorist to go through this process:</p>
<ul>
<li>You should have light hair as a base color</li>
<li>Start with a copper base at the roots, keeping it darker there, then pull the color through the ends</li>
<li>Add “creamy” blonde over the top to get the pastel effect. Different color gradients are desirable-Black said the trend for hair in general is to not be too perfect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interested in giving this color a shot?</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/who-actually-created-the-french-manicure/,Beauty,Who Actually Created The French Manicure?,"<p>Ah, the French manicure. The go-to wedding polish job. The style that will most certainly never go out of style. The most classic, most neutral, most simple nail art that looks good on everyone.</p>
<p>One would assume that the French, of course, invented something as chic as a French manicure. It is, after all, in the actual name of the design. Wrong. It turns out that the French did not invent the French manicure at all.</p>
<p>A Hollywood make-up artist named Jeff Pink is claiming that he is in fact the one who came up with the white tip-nude base combination, sometime in the seventies. Pink then goes on to say that he single-handedly brought the manicure style to Paris, where the most chic models walking down the runways quickly craved the design.</p>
<p>But hold on, is Pink being truthful? There are countless other polish mavens who argue that the French manicure was actually around for about 40 years before Pink claims he came up with it.</p>
<p>The BBC suggests that the early French manicure was, in fact, invented in France by beauty legend Max Factor, for the most fashionable ladies of Paris in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Here’s my take to the situation: who actually cares? It’s a single white line at the tip of your fingers. I’m sure someone would have thought of such a thing eventually, and does it really actually matter? It’s not like you can hold copyright on a nail art design, you would have no way of proving you were actually the first.</p>
<p>What do you think about this ridiculous argument?</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/hot-weather-skin-care-swaps/,Beauty,Hot Weather Skin Care Swaps,"<p>When the weather changes, your body reacts. What was an helpful beauty procedure in February is no longer appropriate for the upcoming 80-degree weather. Your skin reacts differently to the air depending on the different weather, so it may be time for you to swap out your current beauty products for something else.</p>
<p>For example, in cold weather months, your skin (generally) gets extremely dry and tight. Because of this, we load on the rich and heavy body lotions. During the warm summer months, the air is already filled with moisture, which in turn moisturizes your skin.</p>
<p>For your body, try a dry oil during the summer months instead of creams. Oil not only hydrates your skin just as well as body lotions, but it actually helps your skin glow and glisten, which is a coveted summer skin trait. Try purchasing a body oil infused with cocoa butter (a personal favorite of mine) for an added element of soothing-scent.</p>
<p>Your face requires a separate line of thinking. Instead of thick face creams, try a moisturizing serum. High temperatures and extreme humidity prompt excessively sweaty skin. Moisturizing your face with something lighter than a face cream would help keep your face feeling fresh. A hydrating serum would much better suit the skin on your face during the summer months, as only a few drops will completely moisturize your face. Choose an oil-free serum to take the extra shine away.</p>
<p>Paying attention to your skin is important in the shower as well. Instead of a creamy and moisturizing cleanser, try gel cleansers during the summer months. Milky cleansers are normally formulated with humectants that help bind water and moisture into the skin. This is more necessary in colder months when moisture is scarce. When it’s warm out, moisture is everywhere. A lightweight foam or gel is gentle, nondrying and simultaneously frees your skin from dirt, oil and makeup.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/women/beauty/defense-kim-kardashian-platinum-blonde-hair/957867/,Beauty,Baby Got Blonde: In Defense of Kim Kardashian’s Platinum Hair Upgrade,"<p>Not a single day passes when we don’t see Kim Kardashian’s face at least once.</p>
<p>Paparazzi shots capture her rushing out of hotels and climbing into luxury private jets, while celebrity media outlets obsessively report on each designer piece she wears.</p>
<p>But yesterday, Kim somehow managed to shock us, proving the woman who’s publicly appeared <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/topic/kim-kardashian-internet/"" target=""_blank"">fully nude</a>&nbsp;more than a handful of times still has a few tricks up her Alaïa-clad sleeves.</p>
<p>Just hours after arriving in France for Paris Fashion Week, the 34-year-old celebrity <a href=""http://elitedaily.com/entertainment/celebrity/kim-kardashian-goes-blonde-photos/956377/"" target=""_blank"">debuted platinum locks</a> in place of her rich&nbsp;brown hue.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it wasn’t a look anyone saw coming.</p>
<p>We’ve come a long way since the days of Kim’s sex tape and, similarly, we couldn’t be further from the smokey-eyed, bedazzled brunette Kim once was. Now, she’s “<a href=""https://instagram.com/p/z2n8U8uS6Z/?modal=true"" target=""_blank"">Blonde at Balmain</a>,” which really should be Kanye’s next album name.</p>
<p>While media outlets were quick to label the change bizarre and point out she’d failed to dye her eyebrows (which was probably done on purpose, and not some gross oversight), it’s evident the platinum hair indicates a new stage in Kim’s career, echoing the multifaceted approach she’s taken to creating a brand and a legacy.</p>
<p>Not convinced yet? Read on.</p>
<h2>Kanye’s muse</h2>

<p>Kim’s husband, Kanye,&nbsp;is pretty open about having&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.style.com/fashion-shows/fall-2015-ready-to-wear/kanye-west-adidas-originals"" target=""_blank"">a hand in everything Kim wears</a>, even taking credit for elevating her style.&nbsp;She’s gone from glitzy to chic, thanks largely to West’s fashion choices.</p>
<p>But with the arrival of Kanye’s line for Adidas Originals and his new album, Kim has had to evolve as well. Taking a page straight from Kanye’s legacy, she’s decided to go platinum.</p>

<p>Kim has always been skilled at spotting trends, so it’s no wonder her app, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, has made at least&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/07/17/kim-kardashian-may-make-85-million-from-her-video-game/"" target=""_blank"">$85 million</a>&nbsp;in sales&nbsp;since its debut last June.</p>
<p>Kim has since appeared at October’s <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/27/kim-kardashian-west-on-oversharing-adopting-new-platforms-and-blackberry/"" target=""_blank"">Code/Mobile conference</a> and on the March <a href=""http://www.adweek.com/news/television/after-conquering-reality-tv-kim-kardashian-taking-mobile-world-storm-163199"" target=""_blank"">cover of AdWeek</a>, ushering in an era of stylish tech influence.</p>
<p>Even pop star Katy Perry will be following in her pixelated footsteps, creating her own version of Kim’s character-based game.</p>

<p>2014 was the year of Kim’s younger stepsisters, 19-year-old model Kendall Jenner and Instagram celeb Kylie, 17. As Kim nears 35, she’s starting to worry about getting lost in the mix.</p>
<p>Famously (and charmingly) the family diva, Kim surely can’t let her family forget <em>who</em>&nbsp;got them there.</p>

<p>If you’re trapped inside, hiding somewhere between the reality of a frigid slush-land and warm thoughts&nbsp;of sunny days to come, use this awkward seasonal time to your advantage, preparing not just your mind, but your body, for the upcoming sun.</p>
<p>The best part –&nbsp;<em>obviously –</em>&nbsp;is you don’t even have to change out of your sweatpants to change your perspective.</p>
<p>Armed with a cup of coffee and Drake’s newest album, take on these easy spring projects.</p>
<p>When we all emerge from our winter dens, you’ll be extra thankful you’re one step ahead of the rest.</p>
<h2>Get fresh-faced faster than your friends by cleaning your makeup brushes.</h2>
<p>Makeup brushes, the ones you use every morning, should probably be the <em>first</em> thing you scrub clean.</p>
<p>Instead, we usually just pretend not to see the orange glow on the contour brush&nbsp;left over from a thousand&nbsp;attempts to get Kim K’s cheekbones. (We’re guilty, too.)</p>
<p>Make a gentle brush cleanser yourself using <a href=""http://michellephan.com/my-ultimate-diy-brush-cleaner/"" target=""_blank"">Michelle Phan’s simple recipe</a>: Mix together unscented dish soap and extra virgin olive oil, stir your brush around in the mixture, pat dry and rinse with warm water.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Bring the outdoors in for a little fresh air (without the wind).</h2>
<p>Everyone has at least one tiny bottle of essential oil (anything from pine to lavender) lying around the house dating back to the year you thought it was&nbsp;“cool to wear crystals” and “just be really in touch with the Earth.”</p>
<p>Instead of a prolonged shelf-life, put the oil to use. Add a few drops of the oil of an unscented candle once the flame’s already been lit. As the&nbsp;oil melts alongside the wax, you’ll be left with&nbsp;a springy-fresh scent.</p>
<p>It won’t just make you feel good — the rumored health benefits include reducing stress and&nbsp;protecting against infections.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Give your mane a little TLC.</h2>
<p>The awkward split between winter and spring can also be defined as follows: The awful season when split ends sprout like flowers and&nbsp;start to bloom. So if you’re hoping for Blake Lively’s waves by June, you’d better start planning now.</p>
<p>A deep conditioning mask can act as a&nbsp;of it as an improv bikini-body plan — but for your locks, not your butt.</p>
<p>Pinterest is filled to the brim with homemade conditioning recipes, but I’m partial to this <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE5b_b-wb2E"" target=""_blank"">DIY milk and honey conditioner</a> made by YouTuber SofiaStyled.</p>
<p>Make sure to pop on&nbsp;a shower cap so you’re not spreading the sweet&nbsp;goop all over the house, though.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Spring ahead — and clean your sheets.</h2>
<p>Catching the right amount of Zs means you’ll look&nbsp;refreshed&nbsp;and spring-like, but your pillowcases may actually be holding you back.</p>
<p>You might be the cleanest of the crop, but face and hair oil build-up happens nightly, which means you’re counting sheep in bacteria-filled covers. Gross.</p>
<p>We get you don’t always have time (or access) to wash your pillowcases every night, but at the very least,&nbsp;make sure to wash them <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/03/pillowcase-acne-beauty-myth_n_4372709.html"" target=""_blank"">every few days</a>.</p>
<p>If you really want to beat the system, stock up on a few sets so you can rotate.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Take your meal to go.</h2>
<p>After the long, unforgiving winter, it’ll be months before you want to see a bowl of ramen&nbsp;or a squash again.</p>
<p>Kickstart the spring&nbsp;with a sweet smoothie; soon enough, it’ll be time for fruit stands and farmer’s markets.</p>
<p>If you’re not quite ready to go all green, transition into smoothie season with the help of Rabbit Food For My Bunny Teeth’s <a href=""http://rabbitfoodformybunnyteeth.com/pbj-medjool-date-smoothie/"" target=""_blank"">PB&amp;J Date Smoothie</a>.</p>
<p>The sweetness is there, but the calories aren’t.</p></div>",http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2015/08/04151551/Stocksy_txp49423cd92gW000_Small_194074-800x400.jpg

<p>Call me a tree-hugging dandelion or a environmental compost freak (I find those compliments, btw), but humans are destroying Earth.</p>
<p>Some things to consider: Climate experts estimate if the ice caps continue melting at their current rate, the entire East Coast of the United States <a href=""http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/09/rising-seas/folger-text"" target=""_blank"">will be underwater</a> in 100 years or less.</p>
<p>And, since 1970, we’ve killed <a href=""http://motherboard.vice.com/read/earth-has-52-percent-fewer-wild-animals-than-it-did-in-1970-report"" target=""_blank"">more than half</a> of all animal species on the planet.</p>
<p>Al Gore has even&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/spiegel-interview-with-al-gore-i-am-optimistic-a-658673.html"" target=""_blank"">said</a>,</p>

<h2>Going organic means you’ll leave a smaller carbon footprint.</h2>
<p><strong>Impact: </strong>Going organic<strong>&nbsp;</strong>helps reduce pollution. Plants grown with pesticides and insecticides leech chemicals that seep into water supplies, poisoning animals and throw off the ecosystem’s balance.</p>
<p>Organically-grown plants have a smaller carbon footprint than traditionally-grown plants — meaning &nbsp;you’ll leave a less harmful impact on the atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help:</strong>&nbsp;Proving something is “organic” can be tricky. There’s little regulation over the use of the word, and companies often falsely use the label.</p>
<p>To know a product is formulated with “clean” ingredients (at least 70 percent worth) you’ll want to look for the <a href=""http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentidonly=true&amp;contentid=organic-agriculture.html"" target=""_blank"">USDA Certified Organic</a> label on the packaging, and check the ingredients list.</p>
<p>Just a tip: Being able to pronounce everything on the label is a good indicator there isn’t anything too sketchy in there (like synthetic chemicals or toxic carcinogens).&nbsp;Still, <em>always</em>&nbsp;research unfamiliar-sounding ingredients to be sure.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Shopping sustainable means less pain for Mother Nature.</h2>
<p><strong>Impact: </strong>To say something is “sustainable” suggests it’s derived from a renewable source — meaning it can&nbsp;self-sustain for an infinite amount of time.</p>
<p>Sustainability is incredibly important to environmental protection: If a source is renewable, less land is needed for growing or harvesting the ingredient and thus, it&nbsp;promotes a healthier, livelier ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help: </strong>Since there’s no&nbsp;legal definition, determining what constitutes “sustainability” is vague. It’s trickier than terms like “organic” and “natural” to decipher, mainly because you have to research the company’s manufacturing policies.</p>
<p>Make like Beyoncé and check up on it: Look for keywords like “renewable,” “ethically sourced” and “fair trade” when shopping.</p>

<h2>Routinely recycling means Earth won’t&nbsp;look like your bedroom floor.</h2>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/fashion/25skin.html"" target=""_blank"">According</a> to the EPA, product packaging makes up about 25 percent of what goes into and remains in landfills.</p>
<p>Cutting down on packaging waste means freeing up land so the planet doesn’t look like a giant sinkhole. It’s an easy fix.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help:</strong> Always recycle or reuse your empty containers. You can also look for products packed in already-recycled materials.</p>
<p>Many companies use recycled paper in their labels, while others use recycled plastics or metals for the actual container.A good rule of thumb: Aim to produce as little waste as possible.</p>
<p>If something can’t be recycled in the bin, contact your local recycling center; it’s possible that they accept additional materials that your local pickup doesn’t.</p>

http://elitedaily.com/news/world/study-28-magic-age-women-feel-sexiest/,Beauty,Study: Why 28 Is The Magic Age When Women Feel Their Sexiest,"<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>According to a new study, women feel sexiest at the age of 28. Pippa Middleton, Tamara Ecclestone, and Mila Kunis are all at the golden age for embracing their sex appeal.</strong></p>
<p>However, research also shows that a woman’s confidence doesn’t peak until age 32. The biggest self-confidence boost comes from supportive friends and family.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by Lil-Lets, analyzed British women’s attitudes toward being female.</p>
<p>The study revealed that most women are comfortable with the shape of their bodies, including the shape of their buttocks and chest and the size of their hips and waist. Three quarters of British women said that they would not change their body shape if they were given the opportunity to.</p>
<p>23 percent of women pegged their eyes as their best physical attribute, while 20 percent chose their breasts and 13 percent chose their brains.</p>
<p><span>When asked which part of themselves they would change if they had to, 41 percent of women said they’d like to have longer, slimmer legs.</span></p>
<p>The aspects of womanhood that most women enjoy include getting dressed up, wearing heels, and fixing hair and make-up.</p>
<p>The study, which included 2,000 women, also found that the typical woman has four good friends. A fifth of those surveyed want to be more confident around men. The biggest reason for lack of confidence is being dumped by a partner.</p>
<p>When asked which females they found inspiring, 19 percent of British women answered Kate Middleton, followed by Florence Nightingale (17 percent) and Marilyn Monroe (15 percent).</p>
<p><span>Lil-Lets conducted research as part of its We Are Women campaign, aiming to encourage women to be proud of their femininity.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>‘We want to celebrate all that it is to be a woman and the uniqueness it brings,’ Clodagh Ward, Director of Marketing at Lil-Lets.</p>
<p>The results demonstrate all the truly positive qualities that come with being a woman and how they can shape a woman’s life and the way she feels about herself.</p>
<p>It’s fantastic to see women are in fact quite happy with the way they look.</p></blockquote>
<p>The research suggested that women in the North East are most confident, while women in Northern Ireland are the least confident and happy with the way they look, with 80 percent saying that they want to change their body shape.</p>
<p>The top reasons for an increase in confidence were “knowing where you’re going in life” (60 percent) and “having had at least one long term partner” (52 percent). 52 percent of women also said that discovering their natural weight has boosted their confidence.</p>
<p>Struggling at work came in as the second most likely factor to lose confidence, after being dumped by a lover.</p>
