Lifting weights gives you an edge over belly fat, stress, heart disease, and cancer-and it's also the single most effective way to look hot in a bikini. Yet somehow women are still hesitant: Only about a fifth of females strength train two or more times a week.</p><p>Here are 12 reasons you shouldn't live another day without hitting the weights.</p><p><strong>You'll Lose 40 Percent More Fat</strong><br />If you think cardio is the key to blasting belly fat, keep reading: When Penn State researchers put dieters into three groups-no exercise, aerobic exercise only, or aerobic exercise and weight training-they all lost around 21 pounds, but the lifters shed six more pounds of fat than those who didn't pump iron. Why? The lifters' loss was almost pure fat; the others lost fat and muscle.</p><p>Other research on dieters who don't lift shows that, on average, 75 percent of their weight loss is from fat, while 25 percent is from muscle. Muscle loss may drop your scale weight, but it doesn't improve your reflection in the mirror and it makes you more likely to gain back the flab you lost. However, if you weight train as you diet, you'll protect your hard-earned muscle and burn more fat.</p><p><strong>Your Clothes Will Fit Better </strong><br />Research shows that between the ages of 30 and 50, you'll likely lose 10 percent of your body's total muscle. Worse yet, it's likely to be replaced by fat over time, says a study. And that increases your waist size, because one pound of fat takes up 18 percent more space than one pound of muscle.</p><p><strong>You'll Burn More Calories</strong><br />Lifting increases the number of calories you burn while your butt is parked on the couch. That's because after each strength workout, your muscles need energy to repair their fibers. In fact, researchers found that when people did a total-body workout with just three big-muscle moves, their metabolisms were raised for 39 hours afterward. They also burned a greater percentage of calories from fat compared with those who didn't lift.</p><p>Lifting gives you a better burn during exercise too: Doing a circuit of eight moves (which takes about eight minutes) can expend 159 to 231 calories. That's about what you'd burn if you ran at a 10-mile-per-hour pace for the same duration.</p><p><strong>Your Diet Will Improve</strong><br />Exercise helps your brain stick to a diet plan. University of Pittsburgh researchers studied 169 overweight adults and found that those who didn't follow a three-hours-a-week training regimen ate more than their allotted 1,500 calories a day. The reverse was also true-sneaking snacks sabotaged their workouts. The study authors say both diet and exercise likely remind you to stay on track, aiding your weight-loss goals.</p><p><strong>You'll Handle Stress Better</strong><br />Break a sweat in the weight room and you'll stay cool under pressure. Scientists determined that the fittest people exhibited lower levels of stress hormones than those who were the least fit. Another study found that after a stressful situation, the blood pressure levels of people with the most muscle returned to normal faster than the levels of those with the least muscle.</p><p><strong>You'll Be Happier</strong><br />Yoga isn't the only Zen-inducing kind of exercise. Researchers found that people who performed three weight workouts a week for six months significantly improved their scores on measures of anger and overall mood.</p><p><strong>You'll Build Stronger Bones</strong><br />As you age, bone mass goes to pot, which increases your likelihood of one day suffering a debilitating fracture. The good news: A study found that 16 weeks of resistance training increased hip bone density and elevated blood levels of osteocalcin-a marker of bone growth--by 19 percent.</p><p><strong>You'll Get Into Shape Faster</strong><br />The term cardio shouldn't describe only aerobic exercise: A study found that circuit training with weights raises your heart rate 15 beats per minute higher than if you ran at 60 to 70 percent of your max heart rate. This approach strengthens muscles and provides cardiovascular benefits similar to those of aerobic exercise-so you save time without sacrificing results.</p><p><strong>Your Heart Will Be Healthier</strong><br />Researchers at the University of Michigan found that people who did three total-body weight workouts a week for two months decreased their diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) by an average of eight points. That's enough to reduce the risk of a stroke by 40 percent and the chance of a heart attack by 15 percent.</p><p><strong>You'll Be Way More Productive</strong><br />Lifting could result in a raise (or at least a pat on the back from your boss). Researchers found that workers were 15 percent more productive on days they exercised compared with days they didn't. So on days you work out, you can (theoretically) finish in eight hours what would normally take nine hours and 12 minutes. Or you'd still work for nine hours but get more done, leaving you feeling less stressed and happier with your job--another perk reported on days workers exercised.</p><p><strong>You'll Live Longer</strong><br />University of South Carolina researchers determined that total-body strength is linked to lower risks of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer. Similarly, other scientists found that being strong during middle age is associated with ""exceptional survival,"" defined as living to the age of 85 without developing a major disease.</p><p><strong>You'll Be Even Smarter</strong><br />Muscles strengthen your body and mind: Brazilian researchers found that six months of resistance training enhanced lifters' cognitive function. In fact, the sweat sessions resulted in better short- and long-term memory, improved verbal reasoning, and a longer attention span.</p><p> </p>",shape up

Know which vital sign I check first? Their weight. The most important indicator of how people will manage a health crisis is how much belly fat they're carrying. Why? Because your health risks climb right along with your waist measurement. Not only are high levels of belly fat associated with heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and cancer, but obese patients are also 37 percent more likely to die from injuries sustained in a car accident. Of course, it's a lot more fun to track what happens when the number on the scale falls-which is exactly what will happen if you take the following five simple prescriptions to heart. Without that extra flab, you'll be healthier, more confident, and more energetic. And nothing says ""health"" better than having a flat, sexy stomach to show off to the world.</p><p><strong>Never Go on a Diet</strong><br />You've heard 'em all: the cabbage soup diet, the grapefruit diet, the banana diet. Launch into any of these and you're bound to lose some weight. Suddenly, you're not randomly grazing-you're eating with a plan. The problem is, your brain is a calorie hog, and it takes an immense amount of concentration to stick to a complicated diet. So don't. Instead, focus on eating great-tasting, belly-filling foods that will keep you satisfied so you won't be likely to overeat. These foods include whole-grain cereal, oatmeal, green tea, tuna, salmon, apples, walnuts, and lean chicken, beef, and pork.</p><p><strong>Eat Simply</strong><br />Next time you're in a grocery store, pick up any boxed food and read the label. Chances are, it will have a few ingredients you recognize-wheat, sugar, salt-and a whole bunch you don't. These are the chemical additives that food scientists have cooked up not only to foil the spoilage process but also to mess with your body's natural taste and appetite regulators. Your tongue is covered with flavor sensors that guide you to seek a variety of sensations and eat a balanced diet. The people who make processed foods have tweaked the formulas for their chips or soup to achieve a balance of sweet and savory, so you're less likely to grow tired of that food and seek out something new. The solution? Focus on eating foods with only one ingredient. If you think that means you'll spend more time in the produce, meat, and dairy sections of the store-you're right. That's where slim women shop.</p><p><strong>Munch More Often</strong><br />This prescription is all about managing your body's energy needs over the course of a day so that you're never too hungry to think straight. If your food supply slacks off, even for a few hours, it's an invitation to gluttony. An easy fix: Eat every three hours, beginning with breakfast. A study from the University of Massachusetts Medical School determined that people who skip breakfast are four and a half times more likely to be obese than those who make time for it. Be sure that each of your snacks has a good mix of protein, fat, fiber, and carbs. Eating on this schedule will solve the biggest problem people face when it comes to losing weight: being too hungry to keep it up.</p><p><strong>Drink Plenty and Drink Smart</strong><br />Beverages with added sugar account for nearly 450 calories per day in the average American's diet. That's more than twice as much as we were drinking 30 years ago, and those calories are in the form of heavily sweetened sodas, coffee and tea drinks, bottled ""healthy"" smoothies, and sugar-laden fruit drinks. Improve your fluid intake by inaugurating a water schedule: Have a glass of water when you first wake up in the morning, one mid-morning, one before you eat lunch, one mid-afternoon, one before dinner, and one as a nightcap around 8 p.m. If you stick with this plan, you'll find that you crave soda less. If you're counting on that Coke for the caffeine, swap it for coffee with milk. Other smart alternatives include low-calorie homemade juice, unsweetened iced tea, and flavored seltzer water (just be sure to skip those that are high in sugar, high fructose corn syrup, or any kind of artificial sweetener).</p><p><strong>Cook It Yourself</strong><br />After a hectic day, it may seem easier to eat out. But by incorporating restaurant meals into our lives, we're giving up two essential things: money and control. For one thing, plates are much bigger today than they were a few decades ago. Because the plates are bigger, they're carrying more food. And consider these additional benefits of gathering around the table with your family: People tend to linger longer over a home-cooked meal, which has been linked to consuming fewer calories. And kids who grow up in families that regularly observe the evening meal do better in school, weigh less, and are more likely to stay away from drugs.</p>",

After all, that's what happens when you spend half a paycheck on healthy food and pass up happy-hour invites so you can avoid the bar snacks. And those side effects aren't just misery inducing, they're self-defeating too: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that people who turned these pitfalls into excuses were up to 76 percent less likely to lose weight than those who figured out ways around them. This advice will help you battle the bulge without missing a beat of your life.</p><p><strong>Lose Weight, Not Friends</strong><br />Ever notice that the day you announce you're starting a new diet, your friends go AWOL? Here's why: Cutting calories causes your level of serotonin (a feel-good brain chemical) to nosedive, leaving you cranky and unpleasant to be around. </p><p>To keep your serotonin levels in check, figure out how many calories your body needs based on your activity level. And make sure those calories are split evenly among protein, whole grains, and produce at every meal. </p><p>""Unbalanced meals-made entirely of refined carbs, for example-cause blood-sugar fluctuations that make you irritable,"" says Caroline M. Apovian, M.D., director of the Nutrition and Weight Management Center at Boston Medical Center. </p><p>Apovian also recommends adding omega-3 fatty acids to your diet, because research shows that they may fight depression and slow digestion, which helps you stay full longer. (Try eating two or three three-ounce servings of salmon a week, or adding a tablespoon of olive oil, canola oil, or flaxseeds into your daily meals.)</p><p><strong>Lose Weight, Not Money</strong><br />When you're on a diet, you expect your stomach to be on the empty side-not your wallet. But researchers at the University of Washington found that the cost of healthy, nutrient-dense foods like whole grains and lean meats has increased nearly 30 percent in the past four years, while candy and soft drinks have gone up only 15 percent. </p><p>One money-saving tactic: Eat less meat. ""Meat is one of the priciest items on a grocery bill, and most Americans eat more of it than they should,"" says Dawn Jackson Blatner, R.D., a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association and the author of <em>The Flexitarian Diet</em>. Plus, meat is a source of excess calories and saturated fat. </p><p>Most women can slash around 15 percent of their daily calories by sticking to one or two servings of meat a day, estimates Blatner. Fill the void with fiber-rich foods like beans, oatmeal, and brown rice, plus hearty veggies like portobello mushrooms and eggplant. All of these will fill you up for a fraction of the calories and cash.</p><p><strong>Lose Weight, Not Time</strong><br />In a recent study, 41 percent of women cited ""not enough time"" as the reason they don't eat better. Spending just an hour or two on the weekend shopping for a week's worth of healthy meals and getting a jump-start on the prep work (cutting veggies, making marinades) will save you time and pounds in the long run. A survey by the CDC found that almost 40 percent of people who lost a significant amount of weight and kept it off planned their weekly meals. </p><p>""When you don't map out your meals, you're too tempted to grab whatever's nearby, which is often high-calorie junk,"" says Elizabeth Ricanati, M.D., founding medical director of the Lifestyle 180 Program at the Cleveland Clinic.</p><p><strong>Lose Weight, Not Muscle</strong><br />If you drop weight without lifting any, you risk shedding muscle tissue instead of fat. Muscle takes more than twice as many calories to maintain, and it keeps your metabolism revving at peak calorie-burning speed, so it's important to hang on to it, says Donald Hensrud, M.D., an associate professor of preventive medicine and nutrition at the College of Medicine at the Mayo Clinic. </p><p>Your best strategy is to eat lots of protein and strength train for 20 to 30 minutes two or three times a week. Protein will fuel those workouts and help you maintain lean muscle, says Hensrud. Eat at least three or four servings of two to three ounces of protein-rich beans, soy, fish, lean meat, poultry, or low-fat dairy every day.</p><p><strong>Lose Weight, Not Your Lifestyle</strong><br />Watching your waistline doesn't mean you have to become a recluse who spends every spare moment on the elliptical machine. In fact, an all-or-nothing approach is counterproductive. ""Many women make changes they'll never be able to stick with-like eating nothing but raw food or vowing to go for a run at 5 a.m. every day-and set themselves up for failure,"" says Hensrud. ""Total deprivation doesn't work."" </p><p>He advocates skipping extreme regimens in favor of small changes. When he asked a group of overweight study subjects to make several small lifestyle shifts-such as eating breakfast, having as many veggies as they'd like with each meal, and watching TV for only as long as they'd exercised that day-they dropped an average of eight pounds in two weeks. ""When you combine a bunch of little strategies, the cumulative effect can be huge, and you won't feel as if you've given up your entire life to be slim.""</p>",

In fact, just one night of binge drinking can cause gut bacteria to leak from your stomach and release harmful toxins into your bloodstream, according to a new study published in <em>PLOS ONE</em>.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/deaths-from-alcohol"">The Drink That Kills One Person Every 10 Seconds</a> </p><p>For this study, researchers instructed 25 people (11 men and 14 women) to drink enough alcohol to raise their blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels to at least 0.08 percent. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines binge drinking as consuming alcohol to this BAC level within the span of two hours. Once their blood levels reached this point (for most people it was after 30 minutes), they stopped drinking. Their blood was drawn every half hour for four hours and again 24 hours afterward.</p><p>Here's what happened: BAC declined more slowly in women than it did in men. Even after a day, the women's BAC levels were still higher than the men's levels. But that's not all: Endotoxin levels-harmful toxins that are released when gut cells deteriorate and enter the bloodstream-rapidly increased after just 30 minutes of drinking and remained high for almost the entire experiment duration for both men and women. And similar to BAC, endotoxin levels were higher in women than men even after 24 hours.</p><p>So why should we be worried about this? Endotoxins can alter your body's immune response. This can cause muscle aches and force your body to retrieve nutrients from muscles-which is why you might be feeling achy and sore after a night of drinking, says lead study author Szabo Gyongyi, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Prolonged binge drinking also extends the existence of endotoxins in the bloodstream and can eventually lead to alcohol hepatitis (liver inflammation). Previous research has shown that women's bodies may be more susceptible to the effects of alcoholic consumption, which may explain the elevated levels found at the end of the experiment, adds Gyongyi.</p><p>Remember, this was only after <em>one</em> night. A <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/binge-drinking-effects"">recent study</a> published in the journal <em>Alcohol</em> found that an entire weekend of binge drinking can even damage your DNA-yikes. So play it safe and pace yourself the next time you head out for happy hour. If you do choose to imbibe, alternate every alcoholic drink with a glass of water, make sure not to drink on an empty stomach, and stick to the NIAAA's guidelines for moderate drinking of three or fewer drinks over the course of a night.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/binge-drinking-calories"">The Number of Calories You Consume Because of Binge Drinking Will Blow Your Mind</a> </p>","need to know,self care,your body on"

And when it comes to getting the body you want: strength training or cardio? Back when you carpooled in Ma's minivan, men went to the weight room and women hit Jazzercise. But recently, taking a cue from <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/sports"">athletes</a>, many <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/expert-fitness-moves"">fitness gurus</a> insist that <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.whbigbookofexercises.com/?keycode=142688"">strength training</a> is where it's at. Some even suggest ditching cardio altogether.<br /><br />To resolve the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.whbigbookofexercises.com/?keycode=142688"">strength vs. cardio</a> conundrum, we culled research and chatted up experts to find out how each would fare in a head-to-head matchup (don't worry, nobody's going to bite anyone's ear off). Whether you want to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.whbigbookofexercises.com/?keycode=142688"">get buff</a>, torch calories, or run your fastest mile ever, we've decoded which discipline you should devote your sweat to -- and created a workout that's perfectly proportioned to give you all the benefits. Now, let's get ready to rumble...<br /><br /><b>To KO fat -- and keep it off...</b><br /><br /><b>Cardio's edge</b> Calorie for calorie, cardio has a slight advantage. You'll burn 8 to 10 calories a minute hoisting weights, compared with 10 to 12 calories a minute running or cycling, says Wayne Westcott, Ph.D., director of research at the South Shore YMCA in Quincy, Massachusetts.<br /><br /><b>Strength's edge</b> Lifting weights gives you a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-exercise"">metabolic spike</a> for an hour after a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/ipod-workouts"" target=""_blank"">workout</a> because your body is trying hard to help your muscles recover. That means you'll fry an additional 25 percent of the calories you just scorched during your strength session, Westcott says. ""So if you burned 200 calories lifting weights, it's really closer to 250 overall."" And if you lift heavier weights or rest no more than 30 seconds between sets, you can annihilate even more.<br /><br />And there's more good news when it comes to iron's fat-socking power. ""For every 3 pounds of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.whbigbookofexercises.com/?keycode=142688"">muscle you build</a>, you'll burn an extra 120 calories a day -- just vegging -- because muscle takes more energy to sustain,"" Westcott says. Over the course of a year, that's about 10 pounds of fat -- without even changing your diet. Yes, please.<br /><br /><b>Winner:</b> Strength<br /><br /><b>To squash stress...</b><br /><br /><b>Cardio's edge</b> The head-clearing effects of, say, swimming or playing tennis show up faster than it takes to get a brow wax. Just 15 minutes of aerobic activity two to three times a week can <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/stress-and-weight-gain"" target=""_blank"">reduce anxiety</a> significantly, according to a 2005 study in the <i>European Journal of Sports Science</i>. Go at it 3 to 5 days a week and you can cut fatigue by nearly 50 percent. ""Cardio elevates serotonin levels in the brain, a key neurotransmitter involved in improving symptoms of <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/stress-busting-foods"" target=""_blank"">depression</a>,"" says Madhukar Trivedi, M.D., director of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Mood Disorders Research Program and Clinic.<br /><br /><b>Strength's edge</b> A big question mark. Scientists note promising results on the mood-altering effects of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.whbigbookofexercises.com/?keycode=142688"">pumping iron</a>. But more research is needed to nail the intensity and duration necessary to match cardio's benefits. So, for now<br /><br /><b>Winner:</b> Cardio<br /><br /><b>To love standing naked in front of the mirror...</b><br /><br /><b>Cardio's edge</b> Sports psychologists have been studying the effect of aerobic activity on self-confidence for decades. And they keep coming to the same conclusion: Runners, cyclists, swimmers, and other athletes have high confidence levels because of the sense of accomplishment they feel each time they cross the finish line -- even when they bring up the rear.<br /><br /><b>Strength's edge</b> Think you look hot immediately after a workout? It's not your imagination. Blood has rushed to your muscles, making them swell and appear more toned. Beyond vanity, you feel confident because you just pressed some major poundage. In 2006, researchers at McMaster University in Ontario tested subjects' body image -- how they felt about others checking them out, and how satisfied they were with their own appearance before and after 12 weeks of strength training. The women made <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.whbigbookofexercises.com/?keycode=142688"">significant improvements</a>, and they were particularly influenced by the physical results of increasing the amount lifted. So try this: Keep a log of how many sets and reps you complete and how much weight you're hoisting for each move. Every 4 weeks, go back and review your first workout. Feel the rush of pride, then strut your stuff.<br /><br /><b>Winner:</b> Strength<br /><br /><b>To stay off the sideline</b><br /><br /><b>Cardio's edge</b> [<i>radio silence</i>] The repetitive nature of <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/sports-injuries"" target=""_blank"">cardio puts serious pressure on your joints, ligaments, muscles, tendons</a> -- and the cartilage in between. If you've got a weak link, you're screaming to be benched. That is, unless you hit the weight room.<br /><br /><b>Strength's edge</b> In a 2006 study in the <i>American Journal of Sports Medicine</i>, researchers found that a balance-training program -- think single-leg squats and anything on a wobble board -- reduced the risk of ankle sprains in athletes. ""Functional strength training teaches your brain to allow muscle contractions that are quick enough to prevent or minimize injuries,"" says lead study author Tim McGuine, Ph.D., senior athletic trainer and research coordinator at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Your best bet: Choose moves that <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.whbigbookofexercises.com/?keycode=142688"">work your core</a>, improve your balance, and force you to bend at multiple joints -- so lunges, rows, squats, and presses are all fair game. <br /><br /><b>Winner:</b> Strength<br /><br /><b>To add years to your life</b><br /><br /><b>Cardio's edge</b> There are more health perks in cardio's corner than Kabbalah bracelets in Hollywood. ""Nothing compares with cardio for optimizing longevity,"" says Mike Meyers, Ph.D., an American College of Sports Medicine -- certified trainer and director of the Human Performance Research Laboratory at West Texas A&M University. ""It reduces the risk of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, stroke, and even certain types of cancer."" The ticker-strengthening benefits are especially sweet: A stronger heart pumps more blood with each beat, circulating oxygen more efficiently throughout your body; aerobic activity prevents inflammation around your thumper; and lacing up your sneaks can increase the ""good"" cholesterol in your blood by up to 8 percent in just 8 weeks, according to a 2007 study published in the <i>Journal of Internal Medicine</i>.<br /><br /><b>Strength's edge</b> A 2006 study by the National Institutes of Health found that lifting weights just twice a week can prevent you from gaining intra-abdominal fat -- the kind that wraps around organs and constricts blood vessels.<br /><br /><b>Winner:</b> Cardio<br /><br /><br /><b>To reach the finish line faster</b><br /><br /><b>Cardio's edge</b> If you want to smoke your frenemy at your next 5-K, put in the miles. ""The best way to train for an endurance event is by practicing it,"" Meyers says. ""Swimmers, for example, need to learn how to <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/breathing-during-exercise"" target=""_blank"">breathe properly</a>, and cyclists need to hone cadence.""<br /><br /><b>Strength's edge</b> For a speed boost, strength training is essential -- especially for your core and legs. ""Plyometrics will improve your stride power, or the force you pedal with,"" says Diane Vives, C.S.C.S., owner of Vives Training Systems in Austin, Texas. For explosive power, she recommends the standing triple jump: Swing your arms back, then forward as you leap, landing on your right foot. Quickly hop forward onto your left foot, then hop back and land on both feet. Continue for 4 to 6 reps. Do 3 sets, resting 60 to 90 seconds in between.<br /><br /><b>Winner:</b> Draw","Getting Started,lose weight"

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/cyber-crime,Life,802,1469,647,9,1,2,8,0,,Online Privacy Predators,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1012-cyber-stalked.jpg,"<p>Bonnie Russell was having lunch with a friend in a pub near Detroit when she got a wake-up call-one that actually came on her cell. A few minutes earlier, she had used the phone to snap a photo of her lunchtime combo: ""A lot of seriously unhealthy fried crap"" she called it when she posted it on Twitter with the wry title ""Lunch of champions."" She received a tweet back from a total stranger who had found her public Twitter feed and used it to track down the neighborhood where she was having lunch at that very moment.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lucky for Bonnie, the stranger was information security engineer Ben Jackson, cofounder of ICanStalkU.com, a watchdog website that alerts Twitter users about the dangers of geotags. Bonnie, 40, was shocked-she works in digital marketing and considers herself a pretty educated user of technology. ""I'm very concerned with what kind of data I share with the public,"" she says. ""And I thought I had disabled any functions on my phone and Twitter that might broadcast my location.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Well, she thought wrong. Geotags are GPS coordinates that can be added to digital files-most commonly photos-and used to pinpoint your location by as close as a 10-foot radius. Many GPS enabled smartphones embed these tags in photographs automatically, and you don't even know they're there. But once you share those photos, someone else can find out where you are...or aren't.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sometimes that's a good thing: GPS technology was developed by the military to find soldiers who were lost in battle, and it allows 911 operators to locate callers and send help-that's why every cell phone made after January 1, 2006, is required by law to be GPS enabled. But experts have become concerned that geotags could be used for more sinister purposes.<br /><br /><br /><br />Already there has been an uptick in other types of social-network related crime: Last March, for instance, the house of an Indiana woman was robbed after she updated her Facebook status to say that she and her fiance were going out for the night. In September, New Hampshire police busted a burglary ring that targeted people based on the locations they posted on their profiles. And a recent Justice Department report found that a quarter of stalking cases in the United States involve cyber stalking, and one in 13 victims reported that GPS technology or another version of electronic monitoring was used. (Forty-seven states have now made it illegal to stalk or harass using electronic forms of communication.)<br /><br /><br /><br />In extreme cases, women have been stalked via their GPS-enabled mobile phones. That's what happened to Louise,* 32, from New Mexico, who discovered that an abusive ex-boyfriend was tracking her via her cell phone. ""His car was showing up everywhere I went,"" she says. This type of cyber stalking is usually done via phone, by someone the victim knows-maybe an ex or a roommate. But it is possible to track someone via cell phone remotely, without ever meeting them, if you're technologically savvy. There are even apps that will turn a cell phone into a James Bond-like spy device, allowing hackers to hear your conversations, read your texts, and generally ride along as you live your life.<br /><br /></p><p><b>Geotag, You're It</b><br /><br /><br />Despite cases like these, and despite the fact that most new smartphones on the market geotag photos, many women have a false sense of security when it comes to social media. Part of it is ignorance of the technology. ""We've found that most people don't know about geotags, so it's not as if they're making a conscious decision to reveal their whereabouts,"" says Jackson. He and the cofounder of his website, Larry Pesce (a security consultant), estimate that about 3 percent of the images they analyze on Twitter alone have geotags on them. If that doesn't sound like a lot, consider that it's about 9,000 photos a day. And criminals don't have to be especially cunning-they just need to know where to look. ""I could probably train a gradeschooler to find geotagged information,"" says Jackson. ""It's scary how easy it is.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Making it even easier-and scarier-is the fact that a lot of women aren't nearly as careful as Bonnie is. In fact, 52 percent of social-network users post info that ups their risk of becoming a victim of cyber crime, according to a recent Consumer Reports survey. Private data such as your full birth date, street address, phone number, and vacation plans are all things that cyber criminals use to hack your password or steal your identity (or your stuff). That's a lot more dangerous than oversharing details about your wild weekend in Vegas. ""People don't realize the danger of posting a lot of information online, and how someone, with very few clicks of a mouse, can figure out all of their behaviors, travel patterns, and likes and dislikes,"" says Dave Marcus, director of security research for McAfee Labs, a computer security firm.<br /><br /><br /><br />Armed with this data, one geotagged photo could be the final puzzle piece a criminal needs to commit his crime-yet we seem culturally obsessed with letting everyone know where we are all the time. Geolocation sites like Gowalla.com and FourSquare.com, which allow users to virtually check in to different locations in real time, are more popular than ever; the latter has nearly 3 million users worldwide.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Our Tech, Ourselves</b><br /><br /><br />And it's more than just glomming on to new technology, psychologists say. ""People want to be known by others,"" says Sam Gosling, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the University of Texas and author of Snoop: What Your Stuff Says About You. For many, announcing where they are all the time is intrinsically tied to their identity. Whether you realize it or not, you probably form opinions based on the kinds of places people frequent (coffee shops, restaurants, bars, gyms), so it just becomes another way of saying ""This is me."" Gosling says, ""In a sense, it's not so different from wearing a T-shirt with your favorite band's logo on it.""<br /><br /><br /><br />So we're likely to continue to embrace and trust the technology wherever it pops up-and GPS is definitely popping up in more places. ""It's hard to have privacy in an interconnected world,"" says Marcus. ""The technology has become cheap enough that you can have GPS basically in every handheld device on the planet."" GPS dating apps allow users to find out who else in the room is single and looking, and sites like OneTwib.com allow social networking within a particular neighborhood. Great ways to meet people? Sure. Great ways to meet creepy people? Absolutely.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why don't we recognize the dangers of cyber situations? It boils down to personal experience. ""If everybody is using the technology, and you don't know anybody who has been kidnapped or had their home broken into, it can't really be that risky, right?"" says Chris Dula, Ph.D., an associate professor of psychology at East Tennessee State University. It's also a relatively new technology, and although it has been used for nefarious purposes by some people, it hasn't yet been abused in large enough numbers to sound a massive alarm. You probably wouldn't let a stranger watch you punch your PIN into an ATM today, but it took years of warnings to teach the public to be careful about that behavior.<br /><br /><br /><br />The best way to keep your personal data safe in the digital world is to be aware and be diligent. ""If you're going to use Web-enabled technologies and smart devices, you have to have a solid understanding of what could potentially be shared and potentially abused,"" says Marcus. ""Ultimately, it's your data and your identity-and your safety.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Have you been cyber stalked?</b><br /><br />Tell us the details of your story and how you fought back at <a target=""_self"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/stalking"">WomensHealthMag.com/Stalking</a>.<br /><br /><br /></p><p><b>The Steps Leading Up to a Cyber Crime</b><br /><br /><br /><b>1/</b> You snap a photo of your puppy playing in your backyard with your GPS enabled phone.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>2/</b> Your phone turns on its GPS receiver and determines your location from the signals of orbiting GPS satellites.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>3/</b> The latitude and longitude coordinates (geotags) are embedded into the image file.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>4/</b> You post the photo to your Twitter account using Twitpic, and the embedded geotag remains intact.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>5/</b> A hacker trolling Twitpic for photos with geotag data swipes your location coordinates.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>6/</b> The hacker plugs the latitude and longitude into a Web program or Google Maps to pinpoint your address.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>7/</b> The next time you tweet about going out to dinner for the evening or leaving for a weeklong vacation in the Bahamas, the hacker who has your address breaks into your house.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>8/</b> You kiss your valuables good-bye.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>How to Plug the Cyber Leaks</b><br /><br /><br /><i>Disable geotagging. </i></p><p>Visit <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.icanstalku.com"">icanstalku.com</a> to find directions for disabling geotagging on various devices, and pay attention when you post photos.

Check out a few of the surprising perks you can reap from <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/sex-positions"">great sex</a>.</p><p><strong>Less Stress</strong><br />If you're freaking out about tomorrow's job interview, slip between the sheets. Research from the University of the West of Scotland reveals that people who had intercourse at least once over two weeks were better able to manage stressful situations such as public speaking, says study author and psychology professor Stuart Brody, Ph.D. That's because endorphins and oxytocin are released during sex, and these feel-good hormones activate pleasure centers in the brain that create feelings of intimacy and relaxation and help stave off anxiety and depression, says WH advisor Laura Berman, Ph.D., an assistant clinical professor of ob-gyn and psychiatry at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University and author of <em>It's Not Him, It's You!</em> You don't have to climax to net the effects, but you'll get the biggest surge of soothing hormones if you have an orgasm. Just one more reason to shoot for a stellar finish! </p><p><strong>Sounder Sleep</strong><br />It's downright dreamy how an O can lull you to sleep. That's because the same endorphins that help you de-stress can also relax your mind and body, priming you for slumber, says Cindy M. Meston, Ph.D., director of the Sexual Psychophysiology Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin and coauthor of <em>Why Women Have Sex</em>. Plus, during orgasm, the hormone prolactin is released. ""Prolactin levels are naturally higher when we sleep, which suggests a strong relationship between the two,"" she says. But if you're wild in the sack, take note: Highly active sex can make you feel more energized than sleepy. Sex should never be a snooze, but if you want to use knocking boots as a sleep aid, skip the acrobatics and opt for a subdued session. </p><p><strong>Minimized Pain</strong><br />Talk about flipping the script: ""Yes, tonight, honey-I have a headache."" The surge of hormones released after an orgasm can help ease any annoying ache, whether it's a strained back or a head pounder, says Meston. A study conducted at the Headache Clinic at Southern Illinois University found that half of female migraine sufferers reported relief after climaxing. ""The endorphins that are released during an orgasm closely resemble morphine, and they effectively relieve pain,"" says Meston. Have a migraine but your man isn't around? Self-medicate by treating yourself with some solo sex. As long as you hit your peak, masturbating will have the same soothing effect. </p><p><strong>Fewer Colds</strong><br />There's nothing sexy about sneezing, wheezing, or that runny-nose look. But getting hot and bothered can help you avoid coming down with the sniffles: People who have sex were found to have higher levels of an antibody called immunoglobulin A (IgA), according to researchers at Wilkes University in Pennsylvania. These antibodies help combat diseases and keep the body safe from colds and flu. Save up your sick days and use them as sex days! </p><p><strong>A Youthful Glow</strong><br />Get busy to get gorgeous: In a study conducted at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital in Scotland, a panel of judges viewed participants through a one-way mirror and guessed their ages. Those who were enjoying lots of nooky with a steady partner-four times a week, on average-were perceived to be seven to 12 years younger than their actual age. Regular sex promotes the release of hormones, including testosterone and estrogen, which can keep the body looking young and vital; estrogen has also been shown to promote soft skin and shiny hair, says Meston. Move over, moisturizer-time to turn back the clock with some shagging. </p><p><strong>Lighter Periods (with Fewer Cramps)</strong><br />""When a woman orgasms, her uterus contracts and, in the process, rids the body of cramp-causing compounds,"" explains Meston. The increased number of uterine contractions can also help expel blood and tissue more quickly, helping to end your period faster, she adds. </p><p>Going horizontal while menstruating has also been shown to help decrease the risk for endometriosis, a common condition in which uterine tissue grows outside of the uterus, causing pelvic pain and sex that hurts, according to researchers at Yale University School of Medicine. </p><p>Sex during your period may not sound too appealing, but don't stress over making a mess.

Stop in again months later, and many of those same women won't look that much slimmer, despite the countless hours they've spent pounding away on that moving belt.</p> <p>Here's why: Most people operate under the assumption that the more they run, the more weight they'll lose. That's true, but only to a point. <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/running-for-weightloss"">Running</a> is an incredibly effective and efficient form of exercise for burning calories. (You burn about 8.5 calories a minute when moving at a comfortable pace.) Problem is, the more miles you log, the more efficient your body becomes at running and the fewer calories it burns, says Wayne Westcott, Ph.D., fitness research director at Quincy College in Massachusetts.</p> <p>In other words, you'll initially drop some pounds, but your progress will flatline as soon as your body adjusts to your exercise regimen. Plus, running long distances on a regular basis takes a physical toll (in the form of injuries, like runner's knee) and can seriously dampen your enthusiasm. Ultimately, all that pain and boredom can cause many people to burn out and give up.</p> <p>Thankfully, there is a better (and easier) way. By learning how to make your runs more efficient at burning fat (by running with more intensity and by making your body stronger), you can get more benefits in less time, says Andrew Kastor, a running coach in Mammoth Lakes, California. You'll still need to run three to five days a week (depending on which of the two programs you decide to follow), but rarely for more than 20 minutes a pop. That's not so bad, right?</p><p><b>Sneak in Some Speed</b><br />If you work out, you've probably heard of <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/fat-burners"">intervals</a>-short bursts of intense exercise with periods of recovery in between. Here's why they work: When you chug along at a comfortable pace (as most people do), your body gets energy easily from the oxygen you inhale. But once you switch into high gear, your muscles start working harder to process that O2, so they expend extra energy recruiting other chemicals in the body (adenosine-triphosphate and phosphocreatine, in case you're interested) to get the job done.</p> <p>""Your body likes to be on cruise control, because that's where it's most gas efficient,"" explains Westcott. ""But when you push on the gas pedal, as you do in intervals, your body becomes less efficient and has to burn more calories to do the activity.""</p> <p>And these quick-but-killer efforts may be the closest thing you'll find to a magic calorie-burning bullet. You not only log less sweat time (which is kinder to your body) but also continue to incinerate calories at an increased rate even during the walking or jogging recovery periods, says Westcott.</p> <p>The <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/start-running"">body-slimming benefits</a> of intervals don't end there. Your metabolism logs serious OT after your run too. In a study in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, women who ran hard for two minutes followed by three minutes at a low intensity torched more calories in the 24 hours following their sweat sessions than those who did slow, steady mileage. They also lost 4 percent of their body fat in the weeks that followed, while the continuous-pace group didn't lose any. That might not sound like a huge number, but ""it's enough to see a noticeable change in the mirror,"" says lead study author Craig Broeder, Ph.D., an exercise consultant in Naperville, Illinois.</p> <p>Intervals come in a variety of sizes, and you can count on the fat-melting effects no matter how long an interval you do. ""It's best to mix and match short, medium, and long intervals to keep your body guessing,"" says Westcott.</p> <p>Devote one day a week to one of the calorie-crushing regimens below, says Kastor. Warm up and cool down with five to 10 minutes of slow jogging or fast walking. For the most slimming results, switch up your workout-don't just stick with the interval routine that feels easiest. (You can totally do this as a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/treadmill-workout"">treadmill program</a>, too.)</p> <p><i>Quickies</i><br />Find a flat section of road, or hit the track or treadmill, and speed up to a hard but sustainable effort (really huffing and puffing) for 15 seconds. Jog or walk to recover for 60 seconds. Repeat six times.</p> <p>Beginner: Build up to 10 intervals over eight weeks.<br />Seasoned Runner: Build up to 12.</p> <p><i>Short Repeats</i><br />Find a flat section of road, or hit the track or treadmill, and speed up to a hard but sustainable effort for 30 seconds. Jog or walk to recover for 60 seconds. Repeat four times.</p> <p>Beginner: Build up to 10 intervals over eight weeks.<br />Seasoned Runner: Build up to 12.</p> <p><i>Long Repeats</i><br />Beginner: Run a quarter of a mile (equal to one loop of a track) on flat or rolling terrain at a hard but sustainable effort, and recover by jogging or walking for two minutes. Repeat four times, building up to eight.<br />Seasoned Runner: Change the distance to half a mile (two loops of a track).</p><p></p> <p><b>Head for the Hills</b><br />Like many things that are good for you, hills aren't particularly appetizing. But the extra effort it takes to trudge up them is worth it: For each degree of incline, count on at least a 10 percent increase in calories burned, according to Jana Klauer, M.D., a nutrition and metabolism expert and research fellow at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York City. So running up a 5 percent grade (a gentle hill) will burn 50 percent more calories than running on a totally flat surface for the same amount of time.</p> <p>""You work harder when going uphill because you're moving forward and up at the same time,"" says Marcus Kilpatrick, Ph.D., an associate professor of exercise physiology at the University of South Florida in Tampa. Plus, hills recruit more muscles than flats do. The end result is increased calorie burn, a leaner body, and a perkier butt. Kastor recommends doing the following hill workout once a week:</p> <p>Find a gentle hill or set your treadmill to a 5 percent incline.</p> <p>Run up the hill at a hard but sustainable effort for 10 seconds. Jog or walk back to where you started, or reset the incline to zero, until you completely catch your breath (it should take about 45 to 60 seconds).</p><p>Beginner: Repeat four to eight times.<br />Seasoned Runner: Repeat six to 10 times.</p> <p><b>Strengthen Your Stride</b><br />If they gave best supporting actress awards for weight loss, strength training would take home the trophy every time. Think about it this way: Strength training makes you stronger from head to toe, so you can run harder every time you pound the pavement. A review of studies in The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found that runners who did resistance-training exercises two or three days a week, in addition to their weekly cardio regimens, increased their leg strength and enhanced their endurance-two things that contribute to weight loss.</p> <p>And resistance exercise helps keep you injury-free, so you're not stuck on the couch when you could be incinerating calories on a run. A recent study in the journal Clinical Biomechanics found that female runners who did six weeks of lower-body exercises, like the ones that follow, improved their leg strength, particularly in the hips-a common source of pain and injury for runners.</p> <p>If your schedule allows it, try lifting before you run to increase fat burning while you run. ""Resistance training is mostly a carb-burning activity,"" explains Westcott. ""After about 20 minutes of strength training, you deplete your glycogen stores (carbs) so fat is readily available to burn.""</p> <p>And even if you don't follow strength training with a run, you still get an after burn.</p> <p>""You elevate your metabolism by 25 percent for the 60 minutes following resistance exercise,"" says Westcott. So if you burn 200 calories in a 20-minute strength session, count on sizzling an additional 50 calories after your last rep. This total-body strength workout designed by Kate Moran, a trainer at Equinox gym in Chicago, takes no more than 20 minutes and complements the running plans above. ""Working the glutes, hamstrings, and core will help you prevent injury and become stronger so that you get more out of your runs,"" says Moran.</p> <p>Do three sets of 12 to 15 reps (unless otherwise noted) twice a week; rest for 30 seconds between sets. All you'll need to complete the routine is a pair of five- to 10-pound dumbbells and a resistance band.</p> <p><i>Unilateral Lift</i><br />Grab a dumbbell in each hand, stand on one leg (keep it as straight as possible), and lift the other leg slightly off the floor. With your raised foot stationary, lean forward with your arms straight and extended toward the floor as you bend at the hips (not the knees) and keep your back flat. Return to start without lowering your raised foot.</p> <p><i>Lateral-Band Walk</i><br />Place a resistance band around your ankles. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, then step to the side with one foot, keeping your toes facing forward. Bring your feet back together; repeat. Walk 15 steps in one direction, and then 15 steps back, leading with the opposite foot. That's one set. Repeat three times.</p> <p><i>Marching Hip Raise</i><br />Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Raise your hips to create a straight line from your knees to your shoulders. Lift one knee to your chest, trying not to drop your hips. Lower, then lift your other knee to your chest. That's one rep.</p> <p><i>Leg Raise</i><br />Lie on your back with your arms by your sides, palms up. Keeping your legs straight, raise them until they are perpendicular to the floor. Slowly bring them back to the starting position, keeping your lower back against the floor.</p> <p><b>Go Long (in Moderation)</b><br />The good news is that you don't need to log more than one long run a week to get the max calorie-burning benefit, and a long run means 30 minutes or more. This sustained effort will improve your endurance by increasing your heart's capacity and strengthening ligaments and tendons, so you feel stronger during your short runs, says Kastor, who created the ""Run Off the Weight"" training plans, above. ""And the more effort you can put into each workout, the more calories you'll burn.""</p><p></p><br />",

So tricky, in fact, that experts have had a tough time nailing down exactly why some women wind up with a beer gut (or butt) while others drink daily and <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/set/?keycode=142686"">never seem to gain a pound</a>.</p> <p>Here's what we know: Your average drink-beer, wine, martini, pick your poison-is usually a combination of carbs, sugar, and ethanol (pure alcohol). When it goes down the hatch, it makes a pit stop at your stomach, where some of the alcohol is absorbed through the lining and into your bloodstream, giving you that initial buzz. The carbs and sugar go the traditional digestive route, while ethanol, a toxin, is diverted to the liver.</p><p>This is when that innocent little drink starts messing with your internal fat incinerator. Ethanol has no nutritional value, so your body burns it off first. That means any remaining calories in your stomach-whether they're from the margarita or the chips and guacamole you had with it-will likely be stored as fat. And the more fattening the foods you eat, the easier the calories are to store. (Bear in mind that research published in <i>Physiology & Behavior</i> found that alcohol makes us focus on immediate pleasure and ignore the consequences, which often results in eating junk food.) Unlike protein and carbs, which require some energy for the body to break down and store, fat can directly deposit itself, so those chips are first in line to be plastered to your thighs.</p><p>Still, the situation might not be as bleak as it appears, because the real problem may not be drinking itself, but how often and how hard we hit the bottle.</p> <p><b>Drink and Shrink?</b><br />Earlier this year, the <i>Archives of Internal Medicine</i> published what may be the best news for booze since the 21st Amendment. Researchers found that women who had one or two alcoholic drinks a day were actually less likely to gain weight than those who shunned the sauce. And they did it while consuming more calories overall (from food and drink) than both heavy drinkers and teetotalers.</p><p>Short of striking a deal with the devil, how did they manage to pull that off? Researchers believe that the bodies of long-term moderate drinkers somehow adapt to metabolize alcohol differently than heavy or occasional drinkers. They use more energy, burning the calories in the drink-or even more than that-while digesting it, says Lu Wang, M.D., Ph.D., the lead researcher of the study and an instructor in medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Researchers are still working out the specifics of how and why this happens, but they've figured out that for women who drink up to eight ounces of an alcoholic beverage a day, those calories simply don't end up as extra fat.</p><p>Of course, there's a catch. Women who bank their daily drinks for weekends or girls' nights out don't qualify for the free-calorie plan (and among the 18-to-25 crowd, this ""binge"" behavior is on the rise, according to a 2009 <i>Addiction</i> study). ""Your body adjusts metabolically to the amount you drink, and when you don't drink regularly, your body can't adjust,"" says Wang. Instead of learning to disregard those nutritionally empty calories, your body automatically stores them-as fat. It's akin to tossing old clothes you don't wear into the back of your closet, only your body doesn't have the good sense to hide the junk. It tends to store the fat front and center, in your belly.</p><p><b>Booze Clues</b><br />Evidence suggests that moderate drinkers also tend to practice healthier habits than teetotalers. If you're used to having three or four drinks every week as part of your diet, you're probably compensating for them with fewer calories elsewhere. ""These women know how to moderate how much they drink, so it makes sense that they'd moderate what they eat as well,"" says Robert Klesges, Ph.D., a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis. The <i>Archives</i> study found that these women also exercise more, which knocks off additional calories.</p><p>Another thing that helped: The women in the Archives study were served no more than two four-ounce glasses of wine or two 1.5-ounce shots of liquor a day. In real life, you're likely to be handed far more than that by a bartender or waitress-20 to 45 percent more, according to a 2009 study in the journal <i>Alcohol</i>. And we're not much better when left to our own devices. ""Eyeballing the right amount is very difficult,"" says William C. Kerr, Ph.D., a senior scientist at the Alcohol Research Group in Emeryville, California. ""Most of us don't even know how much we should be shooting for, so overpouring is typical.""</p><p>It's especially easy to overdo it with vino, given that the average wineglass these days looks big enough to hold a school of fish. So a bottle of light beer may be your best bet. ""Unlike wine and mixed drinks, it's portion controlled-the bottle is right there with the calories printed on it,"" says Lisa Young, Ph.D., R.D., author of <i>The Portion Teller Plan</i>. ""It eliminates the guesswork.""</p><p></p>",

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/kissing-tips,Sex And Relationships,1320,738,182,139,8,33,2,0,,Makeout Session 101: Be a Better Kisser,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/makeout-sessions-art.jpg,"Photograph By <p>Sure, you've rounded the sexual bases in your relationship many, many times, but that doesn't mean you should skip over first. The problem is, as many couples become more serious, their makeout sessions start dwindling until suddenly they're not kissing as passionately-or as often-as they used to. </p><p>Here's why: ""Kissing evolved as a way to assess a potential partner's compatibility because it exchanges a host of information about health and hormonal status,"" says Gordon Gallup, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the University of Albany. ""Yet, once people choose a partner, kissing may die down because there's no longer a need to gauge each other's DNA."" </p><p>But even if you know he's The One (or could be!), you owe it to your sex life to keep smooching. ""Saliva contains the sex hormone testosterone, which triggers libido,"" says biological anthropologist Helen Fisher, Ph.D., a research professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey. ""So the more time you spend kissing, the more primed you'll be for sex, resulting in a more intense sexual experience."" <strong>Try these tips to heat things back up. </strong></p><p><strong>Add Novelty</strong><br />You have four lips and two tongues between you, so be creative. William Cane, author of <em>The Art of Kissing</em>, recommends a move he calls ""lip-o-suction."" To try it, softly kiss his upper lip while he lightly chews and sucks your lower lip, then switch, explains Cane. No doubt he will try to slip you the tongue, but don't let him...yet. Wait until he's all riled up, then allow your tongues to wander over each other's teeth, inner cheeks, and gums. The alternating sensations of the hard, smooth tooth enamel and the inside of a soft, moist mouth will awaken your senses. </p><p><strong>Sweeten the Deal</strong><br />Mickey Rourke's character in the movie 9 1/2 Weeks had the right idea when he fed Kim Basinger juicy strawberries during their naked romp. Eat one before making out; strawberries activate the sweetness receptors in your mouth, so when you kiss, your sense of taste will go into overdrive, says Krista Bloom, Ph.D., author of <em>The Ultimate Compatibility Quiz</em>. </p><p><strong>Create Spine-Tingling Chills</strong><br />Swipe on mint lip balm before planting one on him to engage touch, taste, and smell. ""Menthol triggers the body's cold receptors, and when that's combined with your warm breath, you'll feel a tingly sensation from your lips straight down to your genitals,"" says sexologist Ava Cadell, Ph.D. You can get a similar sensory effect by taking a swig of champagne or seltzer. The bubbles will tickle, tingle, and then evaporate. Just one note: Menthol can irritate sensitive skin below the belt, so if you'll be paying each other some oral attention later, make sure you both wash your lips and rinse out your mouths first. </p><p><strong>Rough It Up</strong><br />A small dose of pain will take an ordinary smooch to extraordinary heights. ""The feel-good endorphins your body releases as you kiss and become more aroused are a natural pain reliever,"" says Sadie Allison, D.H.S., author of <em>Ride 'Em Cowgirl: Sex Position Secrets for Better Bucking</em>. ""Plus, when you apply firm touch to the body, you force more blood to rush to those areas, heightening the responsiveness of your skin receptors."" So wrap your hand around the nape of his neck and gently pull him toward you, maintaining eye contact. Then, as your lips meet, slowly get aggressive, letting your passion build naturally. ""The idea is to use subtle force. Lightly pull at his bottom lip with your teeth, rake your fingernails down the side of his neck and back, and tug his hair after warming him up with some soft, sensual kissing,"" says Allison. </p><p><strong>Bring Him to the Brink</strong><br />For the most erotic type of kiss (with the least erotic-sounding name), try ""facial intercourse,"" suggests Cadell. This type of smooch mimics sex from foreplay to penetration, beginning with a tongue exploration inside your man's mouth. ""Rub your tongues together in small and large circles, then dart them in and out of your mouths, as if you were having intercourse,"" she says. ""You can also take turns wrapping your lips around each other's tongues and sucking passionately, alternating between slow and quick movements, much like oral sex."" </p>",

Said friend is lucky you don't slam her head into the giant file cabinet you're trying to <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/dont-lose-your-stuff"">organize</a>. The thing about relaxing is that it can be just as hard to manage as everything else on your massive to-do list. You don't have time to take a leisurely walk during your midafternoon slump or pop into a spa every other night of the week. That's why we've come up with 31 quick, easy tips on <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/destress-instantly"">how to relax</a> - no matter what time of day it is, no matter where you are. Because the last thing you need to stress out about is not relaxing.<br /><br /><b>7:00 a.m.</b><br /><br />Wake up every morning to what sounds like an air raid? No wonder your nerves are shot. The Timex Retro <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/alarm-clocks"">Alarm Clock</a> Radio T247LT ($20, <a href=""http://www.timexaudio.com"">Timex Audio</a>) calmly rouses you with soft music that gradually gets louder. Warning: may lead to bizarre dreams (or nightmares) about Dave Matthews.<br /><br /><b>7:12 a.m.</b><br /><br />Feel like a head case? Take the problem by the roots: In the shower, grab your hair close to your scalp - sounds painful, but just try it - and tug up to release tension. Then rub your fingers in small circles over your entire head to stimulate blood flow, which reduces pain and stress.<br /><br /><b>7:24 a.m.</b><br /><br />Swap your A.M. caffeine jolt for a mug of ginseng tea. A chemical compound in ginseng not only kick-starts your metabolism the way coffee does but soothes anxiety too.<br /><br /><b>7:30 a.m.</b><br /><br />Take the dog for her morning constitutional. Studies show that doing just 10 minutes of physical activity three times a day can improve mood, relieve depression, and increase feelings of well-being.<br /><br /><b>7:44 a.m.</b><br /><br />Eat a breakfast that's low in fat (fat takes longer to digest and may aggravate an uneasy stomach), rich in complex carbs (to raise serotonin levels for a relaxed, calm feeling), and high in protein (which boosts brain chemicals that help you focus). Go for plain oatmeal with low-fat milk and strawberries; one slice of whole-wheat toast with low-fat peanut butter and banana slices; or a whole-grain waffle with 8 ounces of low-fat cottage cheese and sliced peaches.<br /><br /><b>7:59 a.m.</b><br /><br />Crank up KT Tunstall's album on the way to work. Listening to music is proven to reduce stress responses such as high blood pressure and elevated heart rate.<br /><br /><b>8:42 a.m.</b><br /><br />Sit up straight at your desk and drop your shoulders. Good posture helps you take in more oxygen and perform better during stressful activities like timed logic puzzles - aka deadlines.<br /><br /><b>9:21 a.m.</b><br /><br />Order a Peace Lily from <a href=""http://www.proflowers.com/"">ProFlowers</a>. A recent study shows that people working near plants reacted 12 percent faster and were less stressed, based on blood pressure readings taken before and after a typing assignment.<br /><br /><b>10:53 a.m.</b><br /><br />Obsessing about the meeting your boss rudely left you out of? Think acupressure. Use the thumb and index finger of one hand to squeeze the soft spot between the thumb and index finger of the other. Hold for three counts. Switch sides. Next: With thumb and index finger, gently squeeze each of your fingers all over. Use your thumb to rub each joint in a circular motion. Then hold each finger at its base and pull gently to stretch it, sliding your grip up the finger and off the tip. For extra benefits, use a dab of lavender oil, which can relieve anxiety and headaches.<br /><br /><b>11:35 a.m.</b><br /><br />E-mail a friend for the hell of it: Social support has been proven to lower stress.<br /><br /><b>11:46 a.m.</b><br /><br />Revel in evil giggles at <a href=""http://gofugyourself.typepad.com/"">Go Fug Yourself</a> or browse YouTube for ridiculous videos. Laughing fits are a surefire way to stamp out stress.<br /><br /><b>12:30 p.m.</b><br /><br />Your favorite lunch spot is a 5-minute walk away and you're still ordering delivery? Big mistake. Get moving on that second 10 minutes of physical activity.<br /><br /><b>1:25 p.m.</b><br /><br />While enduring an annoying phone call, do this: Sit on the edge of your chair and straighten your left leg in front of you. Exhale and bend forward from your hips, keeping your back flat and chest lifted. Hold for 2 to 10 breaths. Do the same with your right leg. This will relieve any tension built up from sitting at your desk all morning.<br /><br /><b>2:14 p.m.</b><br /><br />Visualization reduces stress. So go ahead, picture yourself in an elevator, happily sandwiched between two hot actors of your choice.<br /><br /><b>3:22 p.m.</b><br /><br />Attack of the afternoon blahs! Bypass the Snickers and grab a handful of dried fruit and nuts (which are just as easy to stash in a desk drawer). You'll avoid a mood-scrambling ride on the blood sugar roller coaster.<br /><br /><b>3:47 p.m.</b><br /><br />Keep a golf ball under your desk and rub your bare feet over it for a private foot massage. Bonus: The boss will think you play golf.<br /><br /><b>4:03 p.m.</b><br /><br />To get oxygen flowing again, sit up straight and interlock your fingers behind your head. Pull your elbows back, stretching your upper back and chest muscles. Bring your elbows forward. Repeat.<br /><br /><b>4:27 p.m.</b><br /><br />Still craving that Snickers? Pop a few (that's three - not a whole bag) Hershey's Kisses instead. Researchers at the University of Cincinnati have discovered that consuming small sugary snacks (note: not artificially sweetened ones) can relieve stress.<br /><br /><b>5:10 p.m.</b><br /><br />Squeeze in your last 10 minute exercise session on the way home. If you commute via mass transit, get off at an earlier stop and walk the rest of the way. If you drive, go shopping on the way home - and carry those groceries yourself.<br /><br /><b>5:53 p.m.</b><br /><br />Ditch the starchy suit and pumps for drawstring pants and a terry hoodie the minute you walk in the door.<br /><br /><b>6:16 p.m.</b><br /><br />Sip a nice Shiraz (or any other red wine) to help you unwind: It contains antioxidants that mop up free radicals - molecules that can damage cells and are often released when you're under stress.<br /><br /><b>6:42 p.m.</b><br /><br />Snuggle with your kitty. Studies show that bonding with a pet - even, believe it or not, a goldfish - can help lower anxiety. How do you bond with a goldfish? We don't want to know.<br /><br /><b>6:51 p.m.</b><br /><br />So you're not the Food Network's Giada De Laurentiis. For ordinary mortals, less is more. Prepare a simple, healthy meal that doesn't require many ingredients. See ""<a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/article/0,,s1-2-63-1159-1,00.html"">Ten Foods, Forty Recipes</a>"". And take leftovers for lunch tomorrow.<br /><br /><b>8:00 p.m.</b><br /><br />When you flick on <i>Lost</i>, grab some knitting. Researchers at the Mind/Body Medical Institute in Boston found that repetitive activities can help calm your nerves.<br /><br /><b>9:05 p.m.</b><br /><br />Stress makes chronic skin conditions like acne worse, but honey can make them better. The bee's pride and joy is a moisturizer, antioxidant, and antiviral all in one sticky package. Spread a thin layer on your face and neck, let it sit for 10 minutes, then rinse off with tepid water.<br /><br /><b>9:20 p.m.</b><br /><br />Who said you had to do yoga on the floor? Run a bath and lie back with the balls of your feet propped against the far end of the tub. With your heels touching and toes splayed in a ""V,"" let your knees fall open and your hands float loosely at your sides. Inhale, allowing the buoyancy of the water to arch your back gently. Pull your elbows down behind you and place your forearms on the tub bottom. Let your chin sink toward your neck and take two deep breaths. You should feel a stretch in your shoulders. Next, with your feet hip-width apart, push your toes against the far end of the tub. Raise and lower your heels, stretching your calves. Breathe in as your heels move up; breathe out as they touch the tub.<br /><br /><b>9:45 p.m.</b><br /><br />Gently caress your guy all over until he puts down the remote. Scottish researchers have found that couples who indulge in regular sex have lower blood pressure than those who don't.<br /><br /><b>10:12 p.m.</b><br /><br />TiVo <i>The Daily Show</i> and go to bed. A 1997 University of Chicago study found that sleep deprivation reduces resistance to stress.<br /><br /><b>10:31 p.m.</b><br /><br />Keep a notepad and pencil bedside to write down any to-dos that are weighing on your mind - it will help you let go of anxious thoughts and drift into la-la land.<br /><br /><b>10:40 p.m.</b><br /><br />To ease your body into sleep, tense and relax all your muscle groups sequentially. Start with your toes, move to your calves, then your knees and thighs, and keep going until you get to your face. Deep relaxation has been shown to decrease anxiety.<br /><br /><b>11:00 p.m.</b><br /><br />If you toss and turn for more than 15 or 20 minutes, get out of bed and do a calming activity, such as reading or meditation - or, what the hell, just fire up the vibrator until you feel ready for oblivion.<br />",de-stress

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/expert-advice-for-new-runners,Fitness,1053,553,176,137,29,8757,7,0,,Running for Beginners: FAQs,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/runners-beginners-art.jpg,"Photograph By <p><b>How do I get started?</b><br />Start walking for a length of time that feels comfortable--anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. Once you can walk for 30 minutes easily, sprinkle 1- to 2-minute running sessions into your walking. As time goes on, make the running sessions longer, until you're running for 30 minutes straight.</p><p><b>Is it normal if running hurts?</b><br />Some discomfort is normal as you add distance and intensity to your training. But real pain isn't normal. If some part of your body feels so bad that you have to run with a limp or otherwise alter your stride, you have a problem. Stop running immediately, and take a few days off. If you're not sure about the pain, try walking for a minute or two to see if the discomfort disappears.</p><p><b>Can I run in sneakers?</b><br />Running doesn't require much investment in gear and accessories, but you have to have a good pair of running shoes. Unlike sneakers, running shoes are designed to help your foot strike the ground properly, reducing the amount of shock that travels up your leg. They're also made to fit your foot snugly, which reduces the slipping and sliding that can lead to blisters. Visit a specialty running store to find the right shoe for you.</p><p><b>How is running on a treadmill different from outdoor runs?</b><br />A treadmill ""pulls"" the ground underneath your feet, and you don't face any wind resistance, both of which make running somewhat easier. Many treadmills are padded, making them a good option if you're carrying a few extra pounds or are injury-prone and want to decrease impact. To better simulate the effort of outdoor running, you can always set your treadmill at a 1-percent incline.</p><p><b>Where should I run?</b><br />You can run anywhere that's safe and enjoyable. The best running routes are scenic, well lit, free of traffic, and well populated. Think of running as a way to explore new territory. Use your watch to gauge your distance, and set out on a new adventure on each run. Ask other runners about the best local routes.</p><p><b>I always feel out of breath when I run--is something wrong?</b><br />Yes, you're probably trying to run too fast. Relax. Slow down. One of the biggest mistakes beginners make is to run too fast. Concentrate on breathing from deep down in your belly, and if you have to, take walking breaks.</p><p><b>How do I prevent getting a side stitch when I run?</b><br />Side stitches are common among beginners because your abdomen is not used to the jostling that running causes. Most runners find that stitches go away as fitness increases. Also, don't eat any solid foods during the hour before you run. When you get a stitch, breathe deeply, concentrating on pushing all of the air out of your abdomen. This will stretch out your diaphragm muscle (just below your lungs), which is usually where a cramp occurs.</p><p><b>Should I breathe through my nose or my mouth?</b><br />Both. It's normal and natural to breathe through your nose and mouth at the same time. Keep your mouth slightly open, and relax your jaw muscles.</p><p><b>Should I be doing anything in the gym to build my fitness?</b><br />Working on stretching and flexibility is always helpful, especially to prevent injuries.</p><p><em>(Article originally published in Runner's World)</em></p><p></p><p> </p>",Running

You can see where we're going with this. The next time you're running bored on the belt, change your routine with one of these four programs. They'll help you burn calories, without burning you out.</p><p><b>Play By Numbers First</b>, calculate your maximum heart rate (MHR) by subtracting your age from 220. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends hitting at least 70 percent of your MHR while you exercise to maximize your calorie burn and fat loss. If you don't have a heart rate monitor, count your pulse for 10 seconds, and multiply that number by 6. Keep working at 70 percent of your MHR for as long as you can. When you get tired, slow the treadmill to an easy jogging pace, and rest for a few minutes. Next, see how long you can go at 85 percent of your MHR.</p><p><b>Random Pickup</b> Tom Holland, a triathlete and physiologist in Darien, Connecticut, suggests watching a 30-minute TV program, like the nightly news. Increase your speed so that you're running hard (about 80 percent of your maximum) during the commercials. When Katie Couric returns, slow your pace to an easy jog.</p><p><b>Take a Hike</b> Rebecca Rusch, top adventure racer and 2003 winner of the Raid Gauloises, likes to walk or run on an incline to mimic hiking outside. Some treadmills have preprogrammed hiking trails, but if yours doesn't, Rusch recommends this: Walk at 3.5 miles per hour on a flat belt. Increase the incline every minute until it reaches 5 percent, and stay for 3 minutes. Next, lower and raise the belt every 2 minutes until you've been exercising for 25 minutes. Gradually lower the belt and decrease your speed over 5 minutes to cool down.</p><p><b>Weight it Out</b> If you're short on time, do double duty with your cardio and grab a pair of 2- to 5-pound dumbbells. Perform biceps curls as you walk, raising and lowering your arms with each step. Next, perform military shoulder presses. Hold the dumbbells at shoulder height, with your palms facing forward.

No wonder NCSH issued a <a href=""http://www.ncshguide.org"">call-to-action</a> today in an attempt to boost these sad stats. </p><p>It's shocking and unfortunate that more women aren't taking advantage of these services-especially now that they're covered under the Affordable Care Act, says Gale Burstein, M.D., who was involved in the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation for the expansion of routine STD screening. ""Only about 50 percent of women between 15-25 are getting a routine chlamydia test,"" says Burstein. Plus, recent data shows that most eligible women <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/the-mistake-that-puts-you-at-risk-for-hpv"">aren't getting the HPV vaccinations</a>, or they're not completing all three doses.

But within 24 hours of getting a bikini wax at a reputable New York City salon, an infection crept in. She developed a fever of 102, chills, and pain in her left thigh. ""I thought I'd caught a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/cold-home-remedies"">cold</a>, ""she says, ""but after five days, the pain was worse.""<br /><br />Her doctor diagnosed her with cellulitis, a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection of the skin and the underlying tissue. Jennifer spent the next 15 days in the hospital hooked up to an IV that pumped her full of antibiotics and heavy-duty painkillers. She also had surgery to drain the infection. ""One doctor said I could have lost my leg!"" she recalls. ""It took me months to recover physically and emotionally from the whole ordeal- a steep price to pay for a little vanity."" <br /><br />While there are no reliable stats on body wax related complications, Jennifer's experience wasn't unique. This past March, the state of New Jersey nearly banned Brazilian bikini waxes after two women landed in the hospital as a result of them (one of the women filed a lawsuit against the state cosmetology board). And in 2007, an Australian woman with type 1 <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-and-diabetes"">diabetes</a> almost died of a bacterial infection she got after a bare-it-all wax. <br /><br />What makes them risky? ""Pubic hair is there for a reason to protect the <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty-and-style/skin-types"">sensitive skin</a> and mucous membranes in the genital region,"" explains Linda K. Franks, M. D., an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the New York University School of Medicine. ""Getting a wax literally strips away that layer of protection.""<br /><br /><a target=""_self"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/node/11866"">Waxing</a> can also pull off tiny pieces of the skin's outermost layer, creating a portal through which bacteria can enter the body. What's more, the process creates inflammation, which can trap bacteria beneath the skin. All of this sets the stage for skin infections (including staph), folliculitis (infection of the hair follicles), and ingrown hairs. <br /><br />""Anytime you compromise the integrity of the skin, you're going to increase your risk of infection,"" Franks says. She advises people who have diabetes, chronic kidney or liver disease, skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis, or weakened immune systems to avoid <a target=""_self"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty-and-style/shaving-and-waxing-tips"">waxing</a> altogether. For everyone else, there are simple ways to ward off danger: <br /><br /><b>Choose a facility carefully</b><br />Before you make an appointment, drop by to see how clean the place is, or ask a friend to recommend a salon she trusts. Be sure the cosmetologist or aesthetician you choose is licensed by your state and has received training in Brazilian waxing, says Rosanne Kinley, past president of the National-Interstate Council of State Boards of Cosmetology.<br /><br /><b>Ask about the wax</b><br />""Hard wax is best. It's gentler and adheres to the hair, not the skin,"" Kinley says. ""Speed wax, which is soft and sticky, is applied with a roller applicator, and while it's fast and easy, it's more painful and more likely to tear skin."" Sugaring, a natural method that's kinder to the skin than waxing, is a good alternative. Look for products that are chemical-free; <b>Shobha</b> ($22, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.myshobha.com"">myshobha.com</a>) contains nothing but sugar, water, lemon juice, and glycerin. <br /><br /><b>Keep an eye on hygiene</b><br />Before beginning the process, the practitioner should scrub up or (at least) apply hand sanitizer. Double dipping into the wax is taboo because it introduces bacteria into the pot. ""The waxer should have brand-new spatulas available for each swipe to your skin,"" Kinley says. To prevent burns, she should check the wax's temperature on the inside of her wrist before applying it to your skin. If you don't see the practitioner taking these steps, speak up. <br /><br /><b>Prevent irritation</b><br />For a few days following your wax, apply an over-the-counter topical antibiotic cream and an anti-inflammatory 1% hydrocortisone cream to the area, says Bruce Robinson, M. D., an associate clinical professor of dermatology at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. This will ease irritation and help ward off potential infection. <br /><br /><b>Know the signs of infection</b><br />Check yourself with a hand mirror (look for inflamed ingrown hairs, rashes, or raw, open sores or cuts). ""See a doctor ASAP if you develop redness or swelling in the area, an itching or burning sensation, peeling of the skin, or a fever,"" Robinson says. <br /><br /><b>Sound off </b><br /><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/waxing-health-risks"">Share your waxing nightmares.</a><br />",

Here's why: Over time, poor posture takes a serious toll on your spine, shoulders, hips, and knees. In fact, it can cause a cascade of structural flaws that lead to back and joint pain, reduced flexibility, and compromised muscles, all of which limit your ability to burn fat and build strength. But you can head off all these problems by taking the simple self-test to the right, then using the exercises below to fix your form, soothe your pain, and get your curves moving in the right direction.</p><p><strong>1 FORWARD HEAD</strong><br /><strong>The problem</strong> Stiff muscles in the back of your neck <br /><strong>The fix</strong> Moving only your head, drop your chin down and in toward your sternum while stretching the back of your neck. Hold for a count of five; do this 10 times a day.</p><p><strong>2 ROUNDED SHOULDERS</strong><br /><strong>The problem</strong> Weakness in the middle and lower parts of your trapezius (the large muscle that spans your shoulders and back)<br /><strong>The fix</strong> Lie facedown on the floor, with each arm at a 90-degree angle in the high-five position. Without changing your elbow angle, raise both arms by pulling your shoulders back and squeezing your shoulder blades together. Hold for five seconds. That's one rep; do two or three sets of 12 reps daily.</p><p><strong>3 ANTERIOR PELVIC TILT</strong><br /><strong>The problem</strong> Tight hip flexors<br /><strong>The fix</strong> Kneel on your left knee, with your right foot on the floor in front of you, knee bent. Press forward until you feel the stretch in your left hip. Tighten your butt muscles on your left side until you feel the front of your hip stretching comfortably. Reach upward with your left arm and stretch to the right side. Hold for a count of 30 seconds. That's one repetition; do three on each side.</p><p><strong>4 ELEVATED SHOULDER</strong><br /><strong>The problem</strong> The muscle under your chest (running from your ribs to your shoulder blades) is weak.<br /><strong>The fix </strong>Sit upright in a chair with your hands next to your hips, palms down on the seat, arms straight. Without moving your arms, push down on the chair until your hips lift up off the seat and your torso rises. Hold for five seconds. That's one repetition; do two or three sets of 12 reps daily.</p><p><strong>5 PIGEON TOES</strong><br /><strong>The problem</strong> Weak glutes (butt muscles)<br /><strong>The fix</strong> Lie on one side with your knees bent 90 degrees and your heels together. Keeping your hips still, raise your top knee upward, separating your knees like a clamshell. Pause for five seconds, then lower your knee to the starting position. That's one rep. Perform two or three sets of 12 reps on each side daily.</p><p><strong>6 DUCK FEET</strong><br /><strong>The problem</strong> Your oblique muscles and hip flexors are weak.<br /><strong>The fix</strong> Get into a pushup position with your feet resting on a stability ball. Without rounding your lower back, tuck your knees under your torso, using your feet to roll the ball toward your body, then back to the starting position. That's one rep. Do two or three sets of six to 12 reps daily.</p><p><strong>Assess your posture</strong><br />Wear something form-fitting and take two full-body photos-one from the front, one from the side. Relax your muscles and stand as tall as you can, feet hip-width apart. Then refer to the fix-it plan (below left) to diagnose your posture problems.</p><p><strong>1 /</strong> Look at your ear. If it's in front of the midpoint of your shoulder, your head is too far forward.</p><p><strong>2 /</strong> Can you see your shoulder blade? That means your back is too rounded.</p><p><strong>3 /</strong> If your hips tilt forward and you have a belly pooch (even if you don't have an ounce of fat on your body) and your lower spine is arched significantly, this means you have an anterior pelvic tilt.</p><p><strong>4 /</strong> Look at your shoulders. One shouldn't appear higher than the other.</p><p><strong>5 /</strong> Check out your kneecaps. Do they point inward, causing your knees to touch when your legs are straightened?</p><p><strong>6 /</strong> See if you're duck-footed. Your toes will point outward more than 10 degrees.</p>",

But that's not always possible, so we turned to the experts to find out what really matters most-dieting or exercise-for losing weight, fighting disease, and boosting overall well-being. Here, we crown the champ in each category.</p><p><strong>The Goal: Lose Weight</strong><br /><strong>The winner:</strong> Diet</p><p><strong>The reason:</strong> As research makes clear, trimming calories from your diet is the most direct route to a smaller dress size. ""It's much easier to cut 500 calories than to spend an hour in the gym burning 500 calories every day,"" says Timothy Church, M.D., Ph.D., director of preventive medicine research at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. However, both diet and exercise are essential for keeping that weight off.</p><p><strong>The Goal: Boost Energy</strong><br /><strong>The winner:</strong> Exercise</p><p><strong>The reason:</strong> Exercise causes the brain to pour out invigorating neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine, says Patrick O'Connor, Ph.D., an exercise psychologist at the University of Georgia. People who train consistently report surges in energy, according to some 70 studies.</p><p><strong>The Goal: Reduce Risk Of Heart Disease</strong><br /><strong>The winner:</strong> Diet</p><p><strong>The reason:</strong> ""If you had to focus on one nutrient that would lower your heart disease risk, it would be omega-3 fatty acids,"" says William Harris, Ph.D., director of the cardiovascular health research center at the University of South Dakota. In studies, omega-3s from oily fish lower heart disease risk by up to 64 percent. That said, working out does strengthen your cardiovascular system.</p><p><strong>The Goal: Prevent Diabetes</strong><br /><strong>The winner:</strong> Exercise</p><p><strong>The reason:</strong> Nearly 10 million American women have diabetes. Achieving a healthy weight through diet and exercise is the strongest defense against the disease, but physical activity has a slight edge. Active muscles gobble up glucose from the blood for fuel, which helps keep blood-sugar levels stable.</p><p><strong>The Goal: Prevent Cancer</strong><br /><strong>The winner:</strong> Both</p><p><strong>The reason:</strong> Eating a mostly plant-based diet and exercising regularly remain the gold standard for warding off cancer. Keep in mind: Studies have found the more consistently you work out, the greater the protection.</p><p><strong>The Goal: Improve Mood</strong><br /><strong>The winner:</strong> Exercise</p><p><strong>The reason:</strong> A 20-minute sweat session can be enough to perk up your mood for a whopping 12 hours, reports a University of Vermont study. It may also be as effective as medication for treating depression in some people. And exercise can lead to changes in the brain that strengthen your resolve against stress.</p>",

Why? Regularly adding pushups to your workout won't just strengthen your chest. It will also shape your shoulders, triceps, and glutes while toning and tightening your entire core. Working all those muscles at once torches tons of calories and can even help give your girls an extra boost. Really, could you ask anything more of a single exercise?<br /><br />Learn the basic version with these tips from Adam Campbell, author of <em>The Women's Health Big Book of Exercises</em>, and you'll soon be able to do all the pushup variations shown on the right, too. <p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Exercise   <br /><br />Basic Pushup<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1006-pushup-basic.jpg"" /><br /><br /><strong>A</strong><br />To do: Get into plank position, with your hands under but slightly outside of your shoulders.<br /><br /><strong>B</strong><br />Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor.<br /><br />As you lower yourself, tuck your elbows, pulling them close to your body so that your upper arms form a 45-degree angle when your torso is in the bottom position of the move. Pause, then push back to the starting position as quickly as possible. Keep your core braced the entire time.<br /><br />If your hips sag at any point during the exercise, your form has been broken. When this happens, consider that your last repetition and end the set.<br /><br /><strong>C</strong><br />If it hurts your wrists to put your hands directly on the floor, place a pair of dumbbells (use a pair with flat edges, like hex dumbbells) at the spots where you'd position your hands. Then grasp the dumbbells' handles and keep your wrists straight as you perform the exercise.<br /><br />Exercise   <br /><br />Modified Pushup (Easiest)<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1006-pushup-modified.jpg"" /><br /><br /><strong>Look, Ma, No Knees!</strong>In the pushup spectrum of easiest to hardest, lots of women get stuck in the modified (read: girlie) stage because they find the incline pushup too tough. Here's a clever trick: Set a barbell in a power rack at about chest height. Place your hands on the bar and get into pushup position. Try to do 12 pushups with perfect form. If you can do more, lower the bar one notch and repeat until you're challenged. If you can't for 12 reps, raise the bar one notch and test yourself again.<br /><br />Exercise   <br /><br />Incline Pushup<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1006-pushup-incline.jpg"" /><br /><br />Exercise   <br /><br />Pushup<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1006-pushup-basic-form.jpg"" /><br /><br />Exercise   <br /><br />Stacked-Feet Pushup<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1006-pushup-stacked-feet.jpg"" /><br /><br />Exercise   <br /><br />Decline Pushup<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1006-pushup-decline.jpg"" /><br /><br />Exercise   <br /><br />Pushup with Feet on Stability Ball<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1006-pushup-feet-stability-ball.jpg"" /><br /><br />Exercise   <br /><br />Stability-Ball Pushup (Hardest)<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1006-pushup-stability-ball.jpg"" /><br /><br />",Workouts
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/facebook-status,Life,240,408,440,18,0,2,4,0,,Social Networking: Don't Overshare,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1001-facebook-updating.jpg,"If you've been on Facebook for more than three years, you might remember the good old days when you logged on simply to see if your roommate did something cool over the weekend. Back when status updates simply kept everyone, you know, up to date. ""At first, updates were a more efficient way of sharing the normal stuff you'd talk about with friends-and really, only your friends were reading them,"" says media expert Steven Johnson, author of the best seller <i>Everything Bad Is Good for You: How Today's Popular Culture Is Actually Making Us Smarter</i>.<br /><br />But then our ""friend"" networks mushroomed, and suddenly our news feeds were logjammed with the banal hourly banter of people we hardly knew-and they weren't just posting for their friends, but for an audience. ""Paradoxically, as people's social networks have grown, they have become less cautious and more brazen,"" says Johnson, adding, ""I think it's the shy crowd that is finding the most gleeful freedom posting on Facebook. They can say anything, stuff they've never dared talk about before! It's quite a thrill.""<br /><br />Behold: the birth of the Facebook overshare.<br /><br /><br /><br />Danah Boyd, Ph.D., a social media researcher at Microsoft Research and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society, takes Johnson's theory a step further. In her mind, updates don't just broadcast information-they project your identity. ""This is the digital street, where the goal is to see and be seen,"" she says. ""People want to be noticed, even among their friends. Getting noticed is hard. So they use different tactics, most of which are well known to middle schoolers. There's the gross-out approach, the slut approach, the I'm-cooler- than-thou approach, and the help-me approach.""<br /><br />And that's not all. Read on as we quote actual status updates, with experts' views on what motivates these outrageous, embarrassing, and just plain perplexing TMI offerings.<br /><br /><b>The Oh, Shut Up-date</b><br /><br /><b>Megan*</b> loves it when her paragraphs sing.<br /><b>Jonathan</b> is THRILLED by Time Out's favorable review of his club gig! (link)<br /><b>Susan</b> My kid just gets cuter...and cuter...and cuter every day!<br /><br />Posting exciting news is one thing. You finished grad school? Got engaged? Won the Super Bowl? Good for you. Posting in a way that makes people want to throttle you is another.<br /><br />Clearly, these folks take the ""status"" part of updating too seriously. Parents are often the worst-crowing incessantly about their unremarkable offspring and posting photo after photo. ""Face-to-face, people tend to be more humble,"" Johnson says. ""But Facebook validates indiscriminate boasting. You never see people rolling their eyes or recoiling from you in horror, and sometimes they even write 'Congratulations!' So there's a feedback loop effectively encouraging everyone to unleash their inner braggart.""<br /><br /><br /><b>The Ewwwdate</b><br /><br /><b>Anna</b> My rash is better, but still oozing.<br /><b>Josie</b> Flu, day 3: Vomiting gone, but have the runs instead. And now Jack is throwing up.<br /><br />Maybe these people think they're witty. (Potty humor never goes out of style, right?) Says Johnson: ""One of my sons, when he was an infant, was a projectile pooper."" (Thanks for sharing!) ""If Facebook had existed back then, I would have rushed to post about it. Sometimes you just need to vent."" Still, updates about bodily functions are TMI. You want to look away, but it's too late.<br /><br />Actually, Ewwwpdaters may simply be upping their own antes. If no one comments on posts about your garden, then go for the gross-out! ""The urge for attention turns ordinary folks into shock jocks,"" says Julie Albright, Ph.D., a sociologist at the University of Southern California. ""The more revolting your updates, the more people will notice you.""<br /><br /><br /><b>The Schutupdate</b><br /><br /><b>Jacqueline </b>is putty in the hands of a man who brings her coffee in bed.<br /><b>Melissa </b>just loves morning sex.<br /><br />Oh, she does, does she? Well, goody for her. Some people aren't getting any, and they really don't want to hear about other people's awesome rolls in the hay! And if it's, say, a coworker's post, we really don't want the image stuck in our heads. ""Way back when, you'd have this intimate conversation with your closest friend...maybe,"" Johnson says. ""But bragging about your sex life to hundreds of people shows that people's boundaries have become ridiculously eroded."" Albright thinks it's simpler than that. ""Look, sex sells,"" she says. ""It's the most basic attention-seeking device there is. Describing their sexual antics online makes people feel twice as desirable-live, in front of a virtual audience!""<br /><br /><br /><b>The Don't Save the (Up)Date</b><br /><br /><b>Alexandra</b> Hey, girlfriend! Want to share a room?<br /><b>Charlie</b> I land on Friday- will be great to catch up! Can't wait to see you!<br /><br />Now this is what Facebook is for-networking between friends! Except...Alexandra's friend wasn't invited to J's wedding, and Charlie just pissed off everyone he hasn't made plans to visit while he's in town. ""This is an unfortunate side effect of communicating in a public forum,"" Johnson says. ""It used to be harder to find out you were being snubbed.""<br /><br />Facebook is supposed to be an inclusive environment, but this kind of oversharing-which, really, is a violation of common etiquette-makes people feel excluded. If you don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, remember that even in cyberspace, it's important to mind your manners.<br /><br /><br /><b>The Just Suck It Up-Date</b><br /><br /><b>Candice</b> 'Tis a sad, sad day when one realizes she doesn't mean a thing to anyone.<br /><b>Joe</b> Wish I could just disappear. Just the fact I exist has always hurt people.<br /><br />""Rather than burdening a friend, some people leave a note out there hoping that someone somewhere will help them,"" Boyd says. OK, so maybe post a ""Hey, cheer up!""-date. But if you're the sad updater and you're not really desperate, tone it down. ""I know this great guy whose posts always say things like 'I'm completely incompetent and a bloody idiot,' "" Johnson says. ""The more he insists he's pathetic, the more I believe it."" So unless you want your status updates to actually lower your status, stop whining.<br /><br /><br /><b>The I Screwed Up-Date</b><br /><br /><b>Sara</b> I'm so sorry. I have excuses. Weepy sleeplessness=complete penance.<br /><b>Bill </b>Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me. I can't believe I said what I said. Forgive me?<br /><br />To err is human. To apologize in public, when no one else has the faintest idea what you're talking about, is bizarre. Why the showy display of emotion? ""There used to be the occasional guy who proposed to his girlfriend on the JumboTron at a baseball game,"" Johnson says. ""He needed thousands of strangers to witness his intimate moment, to legitimize it. Those people used to make up a very small segment of the population. But now? It seems like they're half the world.""<br /><br /><br /><b>The I Chewed Up-Date</b><br /><br /><b>Christine</b> is eating toast.<br /><b>Christine </b>just made ramen.<br /><b>Christine </b>has linguine with clam sauce-yum!<br /><br />What's with the people who constantly post about food? The rest of us ate toast today too, but we fought the urge to shout it from the rooftops. Let's call them DCPs-digestive-compulsive posters-and leave it at that. ""If you think about it,"" muses Albright, ""dining is a social activity. The social significance of eating together goes back to our earliest roots, right?<br /><br />""So if someone is at home alone, eating ramen she made for herself,"" Albright says, ""posting on Facebook lets her break bread, virtually, with a community she apparently lacks."" Says Johnson: ""Aw, it's harmless. Just think, some people are still excited about this use of Facebook-saying 'Finally! I can tell everyone what kind of cereal I had...in real time!'""<br /><br /><br /><b>The Re-Up-Date</b><br /><br /><b>Samantha </b>is on the plane!<br /><b>Samantha</b> is landing!<br /><b>Samantha </b>Here comes my suitcase!<br /><br />Overposters-those whose constant stream of drivel sends sensible people lunging for the ""hide"" button on their news feed-compulsively chronicle their every move and alter their profile pictures, relationship status, and so on.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/stretch-workout,Fitness,474,403,108,42,12,816,7,0,,The Best Stretches to Start Your Workout,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1004-superior-stretch.jpg,"Somewhere between lacing up your sneaks and starting your first set of squats, you face the most important decision of your workout: Warm up, or not? There's a good chance you just skip it. After all, you can barely carve out a 30-minute workout window. Who wants to waste one valuable calorie-torching minute on tedious knee hugs and neck rolls? <br /><br />But the short-term investment pays off big-time if you do it right. ""The best way to warm up is with dynamic stretching,"" says Nick Tumminello, owner of Performance University in Baltimore. This stretches a muscle at its full range of motion (a body-weight lunge is a great example). <p></p><p>Dynamic stretching increases flexibility, improves blood flow, and decreases your risk of injury and your recovery time. Translation: Your workout will feel easier, and you'll see faster results. This three-part dynamic warm-up from Tumminello gets your heart rate up, your muscles prepped, and your body seriously ready to turn heads.<br /><strong><br />1. Turn It On: <em>Nervous System Activation</em> (Moves 1-3)</strong><br />Even if your brain is saying ""Bring it!"" your muscles aren't ready to work when you first hit the gym. Your central nervous system, which controls movement and activity, is basically in ""power save"" mode (blame it on a day at the desk or hours in front of the TV). So before you jump into a workout, your brain needs to signal your body that it's time for quick, explosive activity. These moves kick your nervous system into high gear by calling your coordination into action while raising your heart rate and body temperature. The result: Your muscles respond more effectively during your workout.<br /><br /><strong>2. Up the Ante: <em>Muscle Engagement</em> (Moves 4-6)</strong><br />Now that you've got your heart pumping, this phase will turn on weak and underutilized muscles: glutes, abdominals, hip flexors, and lower and upper back muscles. These ""core muscles"" are responsible for maintaining stability and control in your joints while you move. Forgetting to activate these muscles raises your risk of injury.<br /><br /><strong>3. Push Further: <em>Dynamic Mobility</em> (Moves 7-9)</strong><br />For the finale, you'll increase the range of motion at your joints, while improving the flexibility in your large muscle groups from head to toe. And that's a big deal: When your mobility is compromised by stiff muscles, you spend more energy during your workout fighting against your body's limitations, rather than burning calories.<br /><br /> </p><p></p> Exercise   <br /><br />Jumping Jacks<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1004-superior-stretch-jumping-jacks.jpg"" /><br /><br />Stand with your feet together and your hands at your sides <strong>(a)</strong>.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/sex-myths,Sex And Relationships,695,390,95,98,2,32,16,0,,8 Sex Myths Debunked,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/sex-myths.jpg,"Photograph By <p>When you were younger, you might have believed a lot of funny stuff about sex-like the idea that you could lose your virginity to a tampon-but now that you're older and wiser, most sex myths are pretty easy to spot. Still, there's the occasional snippet of sexual hearsay that keeps you guessing, and all that misinformation could be preventing you from reaching your peak between the sheets. So we talked to a bunch of folks in the know, and they schooled us on what's true, what's false, and what's just plain wishful thinking when it comes to sex.</p><p><b>1/ Men Reach Their Sexual Peak at 18, and Women Reach Theirs at 28</b><br />No, your sex lives aren't doomed to be perpetually out of sync. Men's testosterone levels peak around 18, but hormones are only one small factor in male sexual performance, says Marc Goldstein, M.D., a professor of reproductive medicine and urology at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. And women have no set peak. If you and your partner need to sync up your libidos, agree to take turns initiating sex every few days. ""Sex at least once a week is like vitamins for a relationship,"" says sex therapist Ian Kerner, Ph.D., founder of GoodInBed.com. And the more you do it, even if you're not in the mood at first, the more you'll want to.</p><p><b>2/ He's Intimidated by Your Vibrator</b><br />Wrong! In fact, your guy might be secretly hoping you'll bust out a new ""toyfriend"" during your next romp. According to a recent Indiana University study, 41 percent of women have used a battery-powered buddy with their partner. And it goes beyond him watching you go wild: ""Many men find vibration pleasurable on their penis and other body parts,"" says Debby Herbenick, Ph.D., a research scientist at Indiana University and author of Because It Feels Good. If he's game, vary the vibration speed and intensity to find something that revs up both of you.</p><p><b>3/ The G-Spot Doesn't Really Exist</b><br />Earlier this year, a French study found physical evidence of this elusive erogenous zone: Women who were able to achieve vaginal orgasm had thicker-than-average tissues between the vagina and the urethra. Whether this area is a magic orgasm-inducing button for you depends on your sensitivity, says Beverly Whipple, Ph.D., coauthor of The Orgasm Answer Guide. ""Lie on your back and have your partner (or yourself) use one or two fingers to stimulate the upper front wall of your vagina with a 'come here' motion,"" she says. Hit the right spot and within 10 seconds you'll know it. During vaginal intercourse, try rear entry or woman on top-both put his penis in a position to hit the jackpot.</p><p><b>4/Men Can't Have Multiple Orgasms</b><br />The idea that guys get only one shot (so to speak) at orgasm comes from mistaking ejaculation for climax, says Kerner. While your guy does have physical limitations on how quickly he can produce and release sperm, he can still experience repeated peaks of arousal while doing the deed. The trick is to bring him this close to climaxing and then ease off so that he feels the toe-curling contractions of orgasm without ejaculating. ""Ask him to tell you when he's about to go over the edge, then gently squeeze the head of his penis to pull him back,"" says Kerner. ""Focus on kissing or stroking another part of his body for 30 seconds-long enough for him to cool down a bit, but not long enough for him to lose his erection-then start up again."" Repeat until he begs for mercy.</p><p><b>5/ Size Matters</b><br />A bigger penis doesn't necessarily make sex more mind blowing. For one, it won't help a guy reach your (very real- see myth No. 3) G-spot, and it could actually be painful if his penis hits your cervix during sex. If his length is lacking, stick to positions that keep you close together (such as missionary), have him use a grinding rather than thrusting movement, and wrap your legs around him for extra clitoral stimulation. Got a bigger boy? Woman-on-top positions (like reverse cowgirl) let you control the depth of his stroke.</p><p><b>6/You Can't Get an STD if You're in Water</b><br />You're actually more likely to catch an STD from an infected partner when you're not dry-docked. Water washes away the body's natural lubricant, creating more friction, which increases the risk of tears in the vagina, where bacteria and viruses can enter. Condoms help, but they are easily weakened by heat, chlorine, and oil-based substances in the water (like bubble bath or sunscreen). ""If you're determined to have an underwater orgasm, stick to good old-fashioned manual stimulation,"" says medical sociologist Adina Nack, Ph.D., author of <em>Damaged Goods,</em> a book about women living with STDs. And use a silicone-based lubricant, which will last longer. </p><p><b>7/ It's Impossible to Get Pregnant When You Have Your Period</b><br />""You can get pregnant at any stage of your menstrual cycle-even on the day you expect your period to start,"" says Sherman Silber, M.D., director of the Infertility Center in St. Louis. Sperm can live inside the body for up to a week, so if you have sex during your period and then ovulate shortly after, his little swimmers could still be hanging around, ready to make sexy time with an egg when it arrives. </p><p><b>8/Watching Porn Is a Guy Thing</b><br />Watching porn is a guy thing.Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis found that looking at erotic images caused a rapid increase in women's electrical brainwave activity that was just as strong as in men's. ""Women can use porn to find out what they like and are comfortable with in the bedroom,"" explains Lou Paget, a certified sex educator. Watch it solo to help yourself get into the mood, or invite your guy to watch your fave film together as foreplay. </p>",

""Plyometrics are a good alternative to strength training on machines,"" says Patricia Fehling, Ph.D., the study's co-author and chair of exercise science at Skidmore College.

In fact, once you've covered the ABC's of sex-from the part of the brain that can interfere with orgasm to the essential mineral a man depletes with every climax-you may have a greater understanding of the wonders of the human body, as well as the human mind. Try these tips, from <em>The Men's Health and Women's Health Big Book of Sex</em>.</p><p><strong>A: Amygdala</strong><br />These almond-shaped structures deep in the brain control the emotional processing system of fear and anxiety. In order to become aroused, women in particular need to power down the amygdala and relax, shelving the day's worries and obsessive thoughts. One of the best ways to do that is to draw a steamy bath about an hour before having intercourse to calm your nerves. Listening to your favorite soothing music while in the bath helps too. Studies have shown that hearing music you know by heart triggers a deeply relaxing physiological response. Cue up the Coldplay.</p><p><strong>B: Body Confidence</strong><br />Your sex drive and self-esteem work in tandem to bring you sexual satisfaction, according to research conducted by Tina Penhollow, Ph.D., professor of exercise science and health promotion at Florida Atlantic University. Boost self-assurance (and pave the way for more O's) by...</p><p><em>Eating healthy.</em> Your body will feel better, and your psyche will feel empowered by your taking control.</p><p><em>Exercising.</em> Try activities that focus on fun and skill yet have a body-shaping payoff, such as swimming, cycling, or volleyball.</p><p><em>Taking care of details.</em> By attending to the finer points-fresh nail polish, smooth legs, a well-fitting bra-you send the message to yourself and to others that you and your body are worth the extra effort.</p><p><strong>C: Clitoral Complex</strong><br />You know about the G-spot-the area that's a couple of inches inside the front of the vagina. Well, French researchers may have found out why touching that spot feels so darn good: A little action there may actually stimulate the root of the clitoris through the vaginal wall. As reported in The Journal of Sexual Medicine, scientists say ultrasound tests revealed that the clitoris is really a ""clitoral complex,"" not just the small bud you can see. It also extends along the sides of the vulva, which explains why exterior stimulation can be so arousing.</p><p><strong>D: Double Protection</strong><br />Using two forms of birth control may make sex twice as good. The Kinsey Institute found that women who used a hormonal contraceptive plus condoms reported higher overall sexual satisfaction. Researchers believe that when women are less worried about pregnancy and STIs, they can relax and enjoy themselves more.</p><p><strong>E: Erotic Literature</strong><br />Reenact some particularly hot literary scenes. Check out <em>Heat Wave: Sizzling Sex Stories</em>, edited by Alison Tyler; <em>The Black Lace Book of Women's Sexual Fantasies</em>, edited by Kerri Sharp; and <em>Do Not Disturb: Hotel Sex Stories</em>, edited by Rachel Kramer Bussel.</p><p><strong>F: Fantasizing</strong><br />Hot daydreams can help women tune in to a sexual experience, says clinical sexologist Ian Kerner, Ph.D., because they help ""turn off the parts of [the] brain associated with stress and anxiety."" To plant the idea of fantasizing in his mind, tell your guy you had a wild dream about him, then play coy. Make him pry it out of you. You may spark some interest (and hear specifics about his fantasies too) without making him feel as if he isn't satisfying you.</p><p><strong>G: Games</strong><br />Most sex games are cheesy and silly. But that's what makes them all the more fun, if you have the right attitude. Try Bumps and Grinds, the classic drinking-and-stripping board game. Or go to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.adultsexygames.com"">adultsexygames.com</a> for free downloadable games you can play with your guy. Check out Romantic Dares: You take turns flipping on-screen cards that describe sexual tasks for you to complete.</p><p><strong>H: Hand Job</strong><br />Try this technique from Tracey Cox, author of <em>Secrets of a Supersexpert</em>.</p><p>The Big Squeeze: Lube first, then clasp one hand firmly around his erection at the top of the shaft. Your fingers should be nudged up against the corona of the head. Squeeze firmly for a second, then release and repeat. It'll give him a completely different sensation than the typical sliding-hand technique.</p><p> </p><p><strong>I: Inner Thighs, His</strong><br />The backs of the knees and inner thighs are highly sensitive to men. Start licking and kissing behind the knee, slowly advancing north. Switch to the other leg for variety.</p><p><strong>J: Juice, Pomegranate</strong><br />Scientists at the University of California at Los Angeles studied this red fruit and found that poms are rich in polyphenols, antioxidants that allow blood to flow through your veins-a key component of good sex.</p><p><strong>K: Kissing, Advanced</strong><br />Try facial intercourse to upgrade your makeout. This smooch mimics sex from foreplay to penetration, beginning with a tongue exploration inside the mouth.</p><p>""Rub your tongues together in small and large circles, then dart them in and out of your mouths as if you were having intercourse,"" says sexologist Ava Cadell, Ph.D.</p><p><strong>L: Lights On</strong><br />There's nothing sexier than a woman who lets her guard down in bed.</p><p>""He loves when he can see and feel your body, and the biggest turnoff for him is your acting embarrassed,"" says Pepper Schwartz, Ph.D., a relationship advisor for PerfectMatch.com and author of <em>Prime: Adventures and Advice on Sex, Love, and the Sensual Years</em>. He doesn't see the imperfections that you zone in on. All he knows is that he loves your body.</p><p><strong>M: Mirror</strong><br />Place a full-length mirror in front of the bed and have him sit facing it on the edge of the bed. Straddle him from behind, wrapping your legs over his and pressing your mound against his butt and your breasts on his back. Now reach around with a lubed hand and stroke his erection. You'll enjoy the unexpected view of his intense orgasm.</p><p><strong>N: Neck</strong><br />Nuzzling his neck is a sign of closeness and intimacy that will make him feel warm and loved. And it may benefit your arousal too: ""Sniffing male pheromones will definitely heighten a woman's orgasm,"" says Kerner. Sniff the pocket where the neck meets the shoulder blade, a natural pheromone trap.</p><p><strong>O: Outercourse</strong><br />This is the term for sex without penetration, and it can be incredibly hot.</p><p>Apply a water-based lubricant liberally to the head and shaft of the penis and the labia and clitoris. In one popular version, the woman lies on her back and keeps her legs together, spreading her well-lubed inner thighs just enough for her partner, on top, to slide his erect penis between them and her lips. She can now squeeze her lips to tighten her grip on his penis as he thrusts and stimulates her clitoris with his moving shaft. From this position, try various circular motions and grinding thrusts to create a massage for the clitoris and head of the penis. If he ejaculates, sperm may still be able to enter the vagina, so be sure to use protection.</p><p><strong>P: Pillows</strong><br />Missionary, from behind, spoon...almost any position can be enhanced with a few strategically placed pillows. By elevating your hips with a cushion or two, you can alter the angle of his penetration and hit a good spot he may miss otherwise.</p><p><strong>Q: Quickie</strong><br />A study published in <em>The Journal of Sexual Medicine</em> found that if women ignore outside distractions, they can start to become aroused in just 30 seconds. Pounce on him when he least expects it (say, when he's frying eggs or after he steps out of the shower). Pull him into an empty room at a party and cop a feel. Initiate a hot and heavy makeout session before work. Quickie sex reminds you of the early days when you did it anytime you had the opportunity.</p><p> </p><p><strong>R: Role-Playing</strong><br />If dressing up like a French maid and a baron is too hilarious for your taste, start off slowly. Many couples find the meeting-at-a-bar scenario easy and exciting. First, agree that neither of you will be offended by anything you do or say while in character. Enter a bar or club 15 minutes apart. Mingle and find each other, acting as complete strangers, each in a new persona. Agree on a code word to signal when it's time to end the game. If role-playing comes from a place of love and trust, there are few downsides, say sex therapists.</p><p><strong>S: Spanking</strong><br />A love tap on the butt can increase your bond as a couple, say researchers at Northern Illinois University. Plus, women get a jolt of testosterone when they're on the receiving end (but men don't), according to research from the University of Pisa in Italy.</p><p><strong>T: Tahitian Method</strong><br />An oral sex technique worth working into the repertoire: He lies perpendicular to your body and moves his tongue back and forth over the hood of your clitoris, stimulating both sides of it.</p><p><strong>U: Underwear, His</strong><br />Take advantage of his notorious propensity for visual cues: Wear his boxers around the house.</p><p><strong>V: Vibrators, the Best</strong><br />Women who use vibrators are more likely to report higher levels of desire, arousal, lubrication, and orgasm than those who don't, according to one study.

But when it comes to fitness, comfort should take a backseat. Women get too complacent with their workouts, says Dixie Stanforth, Ph.D., director of personal training at the University of Texas at Austin. After a while, following the same regimen stalls your progress. The result: Let's just say heads won't turn.<br /><br />To kick-start a stale routine, you have to force your body past the point in a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/cardio-workout"">cardio workout</a> when it wants to say uncle-a point trainers call volitional fatigue, or when you can't do another rep with perfect form. Pushing yourself out of your comfort zone ""enhances both muscular strength and endurance, while cranking up your total caloric burn,"" says strength and conditioning coach Jesse Wright.<br /><br />This fast-paced routine, created by Stanforth and Wright (both trainers on the Gatorade Training Council), targets every major muscle group with supersets-two back-to-back moves with no rest in between-to spark your metabolism. The short but intense cardio intervals added in between keep your heart racing and help you shed more fat. And the best part is, the plan is plateau-proof: As your body shapes up, you'll be able to do more reps with heavier weights and push yourself harder on the intervals.<p></p><p>Yeah, it might get a little uncomfortable. But trust us, you'll be giving this workout mad props a few months from now, when you're confidently rockin' a tiny two-piece.</p><p><b>The Workout</b><br />Do this routine two or three days a week on nonconsecutive days. Starting with superset one, complete as many reps of the first exercise as you can with perfect form in 30 seconds, then immediately do the same with the second move. Repeat this three more times without resting, then go right into the cardio interval, doing the exercise of your choice (treadmill, bike, elliptical, stair stepper). Rest for one to two minutes, then move on to superset two, and continue until you've finished all the supersets and cardio intervals. The key is to choose a weight and pace that exhausts you by the end of the set or interval, while maintaining good form throughout. Stop and rest if you need to, but your goal is to do as many reps as you can within the 30 seconds.<br /><br /></p><p></p><p></p>Exercise   <br /><br />1A: Dumbbell Lunge to Overhead Press<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1103-lunge-to-press.jpg"" /><br /><br />Stand with your feet together and hold a dumbbell in each hand just above your shoulders, palms facing in.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-benefits,Nutrition,447,377,213,59,4,59,18,0,,Why You Need More Vitamin D,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0906-vitamin-d-pills.jpg,"<p>A few years ago, <a target=""_self"" href=""/nutrition/the-best-vitamins-for-women?page=8"">vitamin D</a> was nothing more than calcium's wingman, a secondary nutrient that helped the bone-building mineral make its move from the belly to the bloodstream and eventually plant itself in the skeleton. Well, no offense to C, but new research suggests that vitamin D may be one of the best vitamins of all for your body. The lab guys have uncovered up to 2,000 different genes-roughly one-sixth of the human genome-that are regulated by the nutrient. That means almost everything your body does relies on it.</p><p>""It affects cell death and proliferation, insulin production, and even the immune system,"" says Michael F. Holick, Ph.D., M.D., director of the vitamin D, skin, and bone research laboratory at the Boston University Medical Center. </p><p>Translation: Low <a target=""_self"" href=""/nutrition/get-stronger-bones"">vitamin D</a> will result in your body working far below its potential. And you're probably not getting anywhere near the right amount. Here's why you'll be hearing a lot more about it and how you can score what you need to avoid a vitaimin D deficiency and make your body function at its absolute max. </p><p><b>Nutrition's New MVP</b><br />What's most remarkable about vitamin D is the sheer number of health issues it's been linked to. In the past few years, studies have shown that a lack of the vitamin may be the primary culprit in depression, <a href=""/health/what-you-should-know-about-your-heart"">heart</a> disease, pregnancy problems, birth defects, skin and other cancers, and multiple sclerosis.</p><p>Even if you don't suffer from any of these conditions, getting more D may still be what the doctor ordered. ""Many of my patients report a dramatic improvement in their feeling of overall well-being after they increase their vitamin D levels,"" Holick says. And a number of experts, including those from the Harvard School of Public Health, have urged the government to raise its recommended daily amount of vitamin D for adults from 200 IU to at least 1,000 IU, possibly more.</p><p><b>Why We're D-ficient</b><br />According to a report in the Archives of Internal Medicine, experts believe that up to 77 percent of Americans are vitamin D deficient (defined as having blood levels of less than 30 nanograms per milliliter).</p><p>So why do we come up so short, especially since vitamin D is one of the few vitamins our bodies can actually make? Sunlight converts a cholesterol-like substance naturally found in the skin into D. Problem is, thanks to UV rays and skin cancer, soaking up sun to make more D would do you more harm than good. For your skin to make enough, you'd need direct midday summer sunlight on a huge portion of your body for 15 minutes a day-risking serious sun damage. </p><p>Besides, it wouldn't help much, Holick says. If you live north of Atlanta, it's impossible to get enough D from sunlight between October and March, no matter how exposed you are. And it's tougher for people of color to make D-the melanin in dark skin decreases vitamin D production by up to 90 percent. </p><p>To make matters worse, D is missing from the food we eat, says Beth Kitchin, M.S., R.D., assistant professor of nutrition sciences and patient educator in the Osteoporosis Treatment and Prevention Clinic at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Only certain kinds of fish and fortified dairy have enough D to brag about, and it would be hard to consume enough of both in one day to get 1,000-plus IU. </p><p><b>Easy to Swallow</b><br />There's a simple way to get your D up without baking in the sun. It's not often that nutrition experts say it's better to get a vitamin from a pill than from food, but D is an exception. ""In this case, supplements are the easiest, cheapest, and safest way to make sure you're covered,"" says Laura Armas, M.D., assistant professor of endocrinology and a researcher in the Osteoporosis Research Center at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska.</p><p>Can you OD on it? It's possible, but extremely unlikely. Vitamin D is fat-soluble, which means you won't pee out the excess as you would a water-soluble vitamin like C. This used to worry experts, who thought that D could easily build up to toxic levels. But further study has found that our bodies can handle a lot more than previously understood. ""You'd have to ingest 10,000 IU every day for six months before you'd even begin to approach problem levels,"" Holick says. It's much more likely you're not getting enough, he says. A few ways to get your D intake up to par:</p><p>• Take a daily multivitamin or a vitamin D supplement that provides at least 1,000 IU. In addition, Holick says, drink two glasses of skim milk per day. </p><p>• When buying supplements or fortified foods, make sure the label reads ""D3."" This is the same type the skin makes, but some companies still use D2, a plant-based form of the vitamin that the body doesn't metabolize as easily. </p><p>• Get your blood levels measured, especially if you have a family history of heart disease, cancer, or depression. If you are extremely low, your doctor might recommend higher doses of D. </p>",

But why exactly are these common food joneses so powerful? </p><p>""Food cravings definitely have a physical component, but they also give some insight into the type of person you are,"" says Alan R. Hirsch, M. D., head of the Smell & Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago and the author of <i>What Flavor Is Your Personality?</i> Hirsch should know: He's studied the cravings, <a target=""_self"" href=""/weight-loss/weight-loss-snacks"">food choices</a>, and personalities of more than 18,000 people for over 25 years. Here's something to take away from your midday vending-machine runs or late-night fridge raids besides extra calories. </p><p><b>When You Crave <a href=""/nutrition/foods-to-reduce-salt-intake"">Salty Food </a></b><a href=""/nutrition/foods-to-reduce-salt-intake""><br /></a><br /></p><p><b>What it says about your body</b><br />If nothing but the saltiest french fry will do, you may have a mineral deficiency. Studies have shown that women who eat low-calcium diets want salty foods more than those who get enough of the bone builder, says Michael Tordoff, Ph. D., a researcher at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, an institute that studies taste and smell. One possible reason: Sodium temporarily increases calcium levels in the blood, which tricks the body into thinking the problem is solved. But you may have a shortage of other minerals too. In animal studies, researchers have found that a lack of potassium, calcium, and iron causes test subjects to devour table salt. </p><p><b>What it says about you </b><br />You go with the flow. Hirsch's research describes salt lovers as having an ""external locus of control,"" meaning they believe that outside forces, not their own actions, determine their fate. </p><p><b>When You Crave Chocolate</b></p><p><b>What it says about your body </b><br />You reach for the chocolate because the flavor makes you swoon-but it does that because it stimulates the release of serotonin, Hirsch says. It's basically an antidepressant in dessert form that your body instinctively seeks out when your happy chemicals are bottoming out and you need a quick lift. </p><p><b>What it says about you </b><br />That depends on what type of chocolate you long for: <br /><i><b>Dark chocolate</b></i> You're the life of the party, a social butterfly, and right in the mix of the team project at work. <br /><i><b>Milk chocolate</b></i> You're the quiet, introspective type. Your idea of a perfect afternoon is a solo run or one-on-one time with a good book. </p><p><b>When You Crave Spicy Food </b></p><p><b>What it says about your body </b><br />If you're having trouble cooling down, your body may crave a fiery taste to make you perspire. That may seem counterintuitive, but it helps explain why Mexican food would be popular even when temps are scorching. Some research also suggests that people become addicted to the rush of spicy food-the spiked blood pressure, accelerated heart rate, and rapid breathing, says Tammy Lakatos Shames, R. D., a coauthor of <i>The Secret to Skinny</i>. </p><p><b>What it says about you </b><br />The Perfectionista: You love order, dislike wasting time, and sweat the details. </p><p></p><p><b>When You Crave Sweets </b></p><p><b>What it says about your body</b></p><p>This is a lot like a chocolate craving- lusting after sweets could indicate that you're looking to boost your mood. Or it could be that you're just low on energy. The body absorbs refined sugars of the candy variety faster than any other type of food, giving you immediate fuel, Shames says. </p><p><b>What it says about you </b><br />Sugar fiends tend to walk toward the wild side, Hirsch says. He describes them as hedonistic, with few regrets. They also like to stand out and feel special. </p><p><b>When You Crave Sweet + Salty </b></p><p><b>What it says about your body </b><br />Your body needs glucose and sodium to function properly, so when the cells get sluggish (and you get tired), you reach for the chocolate-covered pretzels to get them revving, Hirsch says. </p><p><b>What it says about you </b><br />You're a loner, but a whiz, too. According to Hirsch's data, people who think a potato chip dipped in chocolate sauce is a match made in sensory heaven tend to be creative but private, to the point that they appear standoffish. </p>",Career Center

Defy those odds by building up your natural defenses.</p><p><b>Pop a Probiotic</b><br />The buzz around gut-friendly probiotics just got a little louder. Not only do some of the microorganisms combat gastrointestinal woes, but they can also influence your body's T cells, the crucial white blood cells that help power your immune system. According to recent research published in the journal Postgraduate Medicine, women who downed daily probiotics saw their T-cell count skyrocket, making them much less vulnerable to infections. Though you can score some of the healthful stuff in a variety of foods like yogurt, miso, and tempeh, you're better off taking a 60- to 90-milligram supplement every morning during cold season, says lead study researcher Mira Baron, M.D., an internist in Cleveland.</p><p><b>Raise Your D Levels</b><br />Supernutrient vitamin D strengthens bones, fights inflammation, and boosts your mood. Turns out, it can also help slay infections. In a national study, people with low D levels were 36 percent more likely to catch respiratory ailments. Other current research shows that, when people with ample D do get sick, they may recover faster. ""Vitamin D helps your body produce a protein called cathelicidin that fights bacteria and viruses,"" says Carlos Camargo, M.D., an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Because it's nearly impossible to get enough D from food-even if you regularly nosh on salmon and dairy products-it's best to invest in 1,000 IU supplements. Take two a day in the winter months, when the sun's rays aren't as strong. (Soaking up natural sunlight prompts the body to make its own vitamin D. However, experts caution against too much D-producing sun exposure because it can lead to a heightened risk of skin cancer.)</p><p><b>Get Pampered</b><br />Regular 20-minute, moderate-pressure rubdowns decrease the body's level of cortisol, a stress hormone that can take a toll on your immune system, says Tiffany Field, Ph.D., director of the Touch Research Institute at the University of Miami School of Medicine. ""Massage stimulates your nervous system to slow the production of cortisol,"" she explains. ""And by lowering cortisol, you're increasing your immune response."" No time to squeeze in a spa appointment? Lie faceup on the floor with a foam roller positioned perpendicularly under your back and slowly roll over it in an up-and-down motion.</p><p><b>Cut Some Calories</b><br />Even slightly overweight people who slashed their caloric intake by just 10 percent ended up with heartier T cells, according to the Journal of Gerontology, possibly because a little extra weight can prompt the body to release a certain immune-suppressing hormone-like compound. Stash a pack of sugar-free gum in your bag and reach for a stick when you crave a midafternoon snack, says Sharon Zarabi, R.D., a nutritionist in New York City. Or swap your regular latte for plain green tea; you'll not only save hundreds of calories but also ward off infection. (The brew is brimming with antioxidants called catechins, which may have serious immune-aiding abilities.) Or, when you're lagging, take a 10-minute walk-even if it's just around the house-instead of reaching for a sugary pick-me-up.</p><p><b>Clock in Face Time</b><br />Surprise: All of your friends come with benefits. People with the most types of relationships-everything from close friends to neighbors-have a greater resistance to infectious diseases, according to Health Psychology. Conversely, that same research shows that loners' immune systems suffer. ""Lonely people often have high stress levels, which can have a negative effect on the immune system,"" says Sheldon Cohen, Ph.D., a psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University. The exact number of friends you need to help you stay cold-free is unclear, but don't let that stop you: Set a goal of making one new connection a month, whether it's at the office, the gym, or the coffee shop.</p>","cold and flu,immunity"
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/de-stress-instantly,Health,460,341,61,167,27,273,31,0,,Stress Relief: 8 Ways to De-stress Your Life,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0901-stress-relief-art.jpg,"Photograph By <p>Relaxing is all about getting your mind off of the stresses of life. Anything that will accomplish this can be helpful in making you feel calm and at peace. Here are some easy ways to feel more relaxed in your daily life.</p><p><strong>Meditate</strong><br />Meditation can be a great way to relax, especially if you are under a lot of stress. Research has shown that meditation can be helpful in lowering heart rate and blood pressure, and even improving cognitive performance. </p><p>And meditation is pretty simple to do: just find a comfortable place, close your eyes, relax your muscles, and focus on one thing, whether it's your breathing, an object (a flower, or a painting)-or even a picture in your mind-perhaps you are sitting on a beach in the Caribbean. You can do this for as little as 10 minutes to experience benefits. The key is staying focused and not letting any distractions or thoughts enter your mind-being mindful is key. If you have a bit more time, take a Yoga or Tai Chi class-both incorporate mediation, along with physical movements. </p><p><strong>Drink Green Tea</strong><br />Green tea is very soothing-it contains theanine, an amino acid that gives flavor to green tea and also promotes relaxation. It is also thought that theanine is a caffeine antagonist, meaning it counters the stimulating effects of caffeine. So, drink green tea, and avoid caffeinated beverages, since caffeine can worsen the stress response. </p><p><strong>Eat Mood-Boosting Foods</strong><br />Many of us crave indulgent carbohydrates like cookies, candy, ice cream, pretzels, and other sweet and starchy foods when we're stressed, anxious, or tense. These foods can have a soothing effect in some women, and it may have something to do with low serotonin levels during these mood states. Serotonin is a brain chemical responsible for feelings of calmness and relaxation. It's thought that consuming these carbohydrates helps boost serotonin levels, which results in feelings of contentedness and relaxation. So, enjoy these treats if they provide some instant satisfaction, but do watch your portion sizes! I recommend 100 calorie portions-4 Hershey Kisses, or a small handful of pretzels. You may want to pre-portion out pretzels, for example, and take them with you as a snack when you leave the house. The 100-calorie packs work well too. </p><p><strong>Create a Relaxation Room</strong><br />Many spas have relaxation rooms to sit in before and after treatments, and it's a great thing to create at home too. A relaxation room doesn't have to be a ""room"" per se-it can be a space in your bedroom, for example, but the key is having an area or room at home, solely devoted to relaxing. You can have a really comfortable chair or daybed, with dim lights, or candles nearby- whatever it is that you enjoy and find relaxing. This will give you an opportunity to decompress, with very little stimulus-this is key. Forget the blackberry, cell phone and laptop-this is a time to kick back and relax. You might want to read a book or magazine, but the idea is to clear your mind of distractions and stressors. </p><p><strong>Listen to Music</strong><br />Listening to soothing music can be very relaxing-and slow tempos in particular can induce a calm state of mind. (It can also slow down breathing and heart rate, lower blood pressure, and relax tense muscles too). This can be particularly beneficial when you're getting ready for a tough day at work, or if you're in your car stuck in traffic, or, if you're lying in bed trying to free your mind of stressful thoughts. Interestingly, music therapy has been shown to be helpful in decreasing anxiety associated with medical procedures: one recent study found that heart rate and blood pressure decreased significantly among individuals who listened to music during a colonoscopy (the control group did not experience any changes). The music intervention group also required less sedation during the procedure. </p><p><strong>Get a Massage</strong><br />Getting a massage is a great way to free yourself of tension and relax, and adding aromatherapy oils such as chamomile or lavender can be particularly beneficial: one recent study found that emergency room nurses experienced reduced stress levels with aromatherapy massage: The study, published in the <em>Journal of Clinical Nursing</em>, found that 54 percent of the emergency room staff in summer and 65 percent in winter suffered moderate to extreme anxiety. However, this fell to 8 percent, regardless of the season, once staff received 15-minute aromatherapy massages while listening to music. If you don't have a lot of spare time, you can get aromatherapy oils and massage tools to use at home. </p><p><strong>Have a Hot Bath</strong><br />Heat relaxes muscles-and taking a long bath can be soothing for the mind as well. Stock up on your favorite bath salts and soaps, get a bath pillow, and decorate the room with candles. You can even create an in-home spa, by incorporating spa treatments like facials.</p><p><strong>Exercise Daily</strong><br />Exercise helps to boost endorphins and reduce stress-and research shows that 20 minutes each day is all that is needed to experience benefits.</p>",de-stress

Too bad this omnipresent piece of poultry is about as thrilling as Ralph Nader on <i>Larry King Live. </i>The solution: 50 fabulous makeovers for your average four-ounce chicken breast. Each one uses just a few easy ingredients that are probably in your kitchen already, and none take longer than 25 minutes. Try a few the next time you cook chicken, and see how easy it can be to serve up this healthy choice. See all of <i>WH</i>'s mouth-watering <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/recipes""> quick recipes</a>.<br /><br /><b><u>Wok This Way</u> </b><br /><b><br />THE BASICS </b>For a stir-fry, cut a raw chicken breast into bite-size pieces or thin strips. Cook chicken in a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/cooking-gear"">nonstick skillet or wok</a> over medium-high heat until browned (three to five minutes) and add one of the following groups of ingredients--in the order listed--and cook for five more minutes, stirring frequently. <br /><br /><b>1. Bell Pepper Mix</b> 1 Tbsp -reduced-sodium soy sauce; 2 tsp sesame oil; 1/2 c green or red bell pepper strips; 1/4 -medium onion, cut lengthwise into strips; 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes<br /><br /><b>2. Veggie Blend</b> 1 Tbsp hoisin sauce; 2 tsp sesame oil; 1/3 c matchstick carrots; 1/3 c chopped celery; 1 scallion, sliced; 2 Tbsp chopped unsalted peanuts<br /><br /><b>3.

Nutritionally, it's similar to olive oil because it's full of heart-healthy unsaturated fats. (Make sure you get plain, not toasted, sesame oil.) But if you don't have it, use canola or peanut oil, not olive, which goes up in smoke at high temps.<br /><br /><b><u>Get Baked</u> </b><br /><b><br />THE BASICS </b>Preheat the oven to 350°F and douse your chicken in sauce, rub it with spices, crust it with goodies, or stuff it with savories. Bake uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes.<br /><br /><b>SAUCES</b> <i>Watery baths like salsa will do just fine in the oven.

It Might Be Messing with Your Memory,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1010-memory-and-stress.jpg,"<p>Everyone has had an experience like this one: You're running late for an important meeting, frantically tearing apart the house on a desperate search for the car keys you just put down...<i>somewhere</i>. Or at the other extreme, you spent weeks freaking out over an upcoming presentation only to deliver all the key points with Oscar-accepting eloquence when the day arrives.</p> <p>So what is it that makes a person either go completely blank or perform brilliantly on simple tasks involving memory when feeling stressed?</p> <p>The answer is complicated, and the <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/top-doctors-for-women"">best doctors</a> out there are finally teasing out some of the bigger mysteries behind how that three-pound mass of electrochemical soup remembers, or forgets, where the damn keys are. An old adage says a little stress is good for memory, and a lot is bad-but it turns out to be true only for men. New research suggests that gender matters when it comes to memory and stress, whether that stress is acute, chronic, or traumatic.</p> <p><b>Acute Stress</b><br />""Your son's test came back, and it's irregular,"" the doctor told Denise Carleton, then a stay-at-home mom in Mill Valley, California. After hearing those alarming words, the 36-year-old nearly fainted as her body crashed over with waves of stress and fear. For the past month, she'd worried that her 2-year-old was regressing on all of his developmental milestones, such as talking and walking. But she never suspected that he could have a serious medical problem. </p><p>Initially, she could barely hear the rapid-fire questions the physician blasted at her. But then she snapped to, answering in detail about when he first walked, talked, and smiled; the dates of his last vaccinations; and every symptom over the past month. ""In the midst of this incredible stress, I suddenly remembered <i>everything</i>,"" she says today. ""Stuff that on a normal day I would be hard-pressed to recall.""</p> <p>Being able to remember things and learn new info depends entirely on the ability of networks of neurons-mostly in the areas of the brain called the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus-to communicate with one another. Picture each neuron as an old-fashioned telephone, but with multiple wires snaking out from the receiver. Some of those wires are called axons, and they intersect with other wires called dendrites at connections called synapses. The brain creates and retains memories in part by growing thicker, more efficient communication lines between groups of neurons-basically, by hooking up the phone wires and keeping them on a biological speed dial. When you try to remember when your son first smiled, says Todd Sacktor, M.D., a professor of neurology at the State University of New York Downstate College of Medicine, the phone lines should start buzzing with activity, connecting the neurons that hold those memories. <i>Ah, he was 4 months old and reaching for his favorite teddy bear</i>.</p> <p>But then you hear that your child might be really sick. Immediately, the fight-or-flight sympathetic nervous system unleashes stress hormones, such as epinephrine and cortisol, into the ""phone"" system, generally making the connections crisper and clearer. The result: ""As a safe general rule, a moderate to strong amount of acute stress-stress that happens once and then goes away-tends to be good for memory,"" says Larry Cahill, Ph.D., a professor of neurobiology and behavior at the University of California at Irvine. Over the years, research has backed something called an inverted U response, meaning that as stress levels increase, so does memory performance-up to a person's own optimal level of stress. Add more than that and memory function fizzles.</p> <p>Then, on a hunch, Cahill's lab decided to take a closer look at how sex differences might play a role in this long-established ""safe general rule"" and, surprisingly, discovered in one experiment that the rule <i>did not</i> apply to women. In that experiment, Cahill tested the memories of both men and women after an acute stress and found that the stressful event enhanced the memories of the men but did not do so for the women. (Yes, Denise Carleton's killer recall seems to contradict this, but stay with us.) It was a puzzling finding: The levels of stress hormones were elevated equally in both males and females-so why didn't it have the same affect on their memories?</p> <p>Thinking that perhaps stress hormones were interacting with sex hormones, they ran the experiment again, this time using only women and controlling for various phases of the menstrual cycle. They discovered that when women had high levels of estrogen (before and during their periods), stress fuzzed up their recollection, but when they had high levels of progesterone, following their cycle, stress boosted recall-just like it did for guys. In other words, women received the memory lift that acute stress provides only when their estrogen levels were normal.</p> <p>Cahill's work was groundbreaking-and goes a long way toward explaining Denise's peak performance in the doctor's office (she was in that high-progesterone part of her cycle). It also explains why, on other days when she's been pelted with curveballs, she's been known to forget that she tossed her cell phone on the bumper of her truck or left a takeout pizza on the roof.</p> <p>""Most of the research on stress and memory has been done in adult male humans, rats, and monkeys,"" says Victoria Luine, Ph.D., a neuroendocrinologist at Hunter College in New York City, whose own work has since revealed similar findings. ""Scientists have taken the male model and just assumed that females are the same. It's a big assumption, and it's wrong.""</p> <p>Especially, it turns out, when it comes to the impact of chronic stress.</p> <p><b>Chronic Stress</b><br />Sarah Wieland, 40, of Concord, Massachusetts, couldn't find her breath. She was already anxious about quitting an executive job in order to start teaching yoga, and was nervously trying to put together her first class. Then suddenly, all the moving parts in her personal life jammed up. She was diagnosed with shingles (a painful virus); her twin 6-year-old daughters had to have their tonsils removed and required round-the-clock care; and she was scrambling to pull together the final touches of a long-planned blowout birthday dinner party for herself, with 45 friends invited, and a much-anticipated 10-day trip to Bermuda.</p> <p>Yet, shockingly, instead of drowning in details, she found herself kicking butt. She remembered doctor's appointments and medication dosages, and had a perfect handle on the party and trip details. ""My first yoga class went amazingly well too,"" she says. ""I really think all the overwhelming stress actually helped me calm down and focus."" She was lucky that her husband was traveling and the craziness fell on her shoulders: New research shows that men generally flounder in the face of chronic stress, and women excel. </p><p>While the increased levels of stress hormones washing over your brain during acute stress quickly recede once life returns to normal-and any resulting memory enhancements disappear-chronic stress (i.e., stress that lasts a least a few weeks) keeps the spigot turned on. Too much of the stuff is toxic and essentially disconnects those phone-wire dendrites, says Luine. The result: The brain is prevented from laying down new memories and accessing old ones, making it difficult to think clearly and remember crucial details.</p> <p>At least in men.</p> <p>""Very few neuroscientists know this,"" says Cahill. ""The conclusion that everybody knows-that chronic stress damages hippocampal cells-just isn't the same in females. It's quite different. And that's remarkable. The sex difference is a big, unfolding story. The idea that sex doesn't matter in neuroscience is crumbling rapidly.""</p> <p>While the fact that female brains are better able to handle chronic stress might be news to neuroscientists, it sure isn't to any woman with a male significant other. In a study last year, Zhen Yan, Ph.D., a professor of physiology and neuroscience at the State University of New York at Buffalo, found that chronic stress in male rodents suppressed the communication ability in neurons in the prefrontal cortex, impairing the working memory-the kind of short-term information storage that remembers, say, what you gave your mother-in-law for her birthday last year. This did not happen with females (<i>It was a coral sweater, duh</i>), thanks to the sex hormone estrogen. It somehow keeps the phone lines humming along even under crazed conditions.</p> <p>Luine reached similar conclusions when looking at the hippocampus, the area of the brain crucial to memory storage. In her study, stress caused male rats to fail miserably on all memory tests, while it helped females ace some tests (those that involved spatial memory-the kind that knows the location of your purse, for instance) and didn't affect the outcome of others. ""If you chronically stress males, they get worse, absolutely. Females actually get better,"" she says. ""It's pretty astounding.""</p> <p>It all makes sense, says Luine, if you put it in the context of evolution. While cavemen were out chasing ferocious animals to eat-and trying not to be eaten themselves-women were back in the cave toiling away at endless child-care tasks. ""The men became adapted to acute stress,"" says Luine, ""while the women became adapted to chronic stress. This is clearly a hypothesis, but it could account for why the responses are different, why females won't show this loss of dendrites in the hippocampus to the extent that males do.""</p> <p>The good news for men is that the scatterbrained effects of chronic stress disappear once things calm down. In other words, the severed phone wires grow back. Still, it's not a condition men or women want to endure over the long haul, because it might permanently impair their memory, says Luine, although this hasn't been tested.</p> <p><b>Traumatic Stress</b><br /> In December 2004, Alexis Moore was driving on the freeway near her home in northern California when she spaced out. ""My mind was a complete blank,"" the 36-year-old says today. ""I had no idea where I'd been headed."" Other days, she'd find herself standing in the grocery store, staring at the rainbow of choices in the produce section, unsure of what she'd gone there to buy.</p> <p>For six years before that, Alexis had been the victim of domestic abuse and stalking at the hands of her now ex-boyfriend. ""The trauma, the nonstop, red-alert stress was unbelievable,"" she says of those days when she always wore running shoes in case she needed to, literally, run for her life. After nearly being beaten to death that November, she finally escaped, though the scars from the traumatic stress still linger even now. ""I noticed right away that I began having difficulties with memory when thinking of dates and times to share with police and the courts,"" she says. Though she had always prided herself on her razor-sharp recall, she entered law school in 2008 with her memory in tatters. ""Simple tasks, such as memorizing laws, take much longer for me than for other students,"" she says. Alexis works hard to compensate, using flash cards twice a day, but any memory improvements are very slow in coming.</p> <p>Traumatic stress (defined as a threat to one's life or integrity, or to someone close, and characterized by intense fear and helplessness) unleashes a deadly assault on the hippocampus, the memory bank of the brain-actually causing it to shrink measurably in size. According to J. Douglas Bremner, M.D., a professor of psychiatry and radiology at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, who specializes in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), this kind of stress can spring from such psychological traumas as childhood sexual abuse, car accidents, military combat, or assault. The massive brain mess left in its wake includes deficits in declarative memory (remembering facts or lists), fragmentation of memories (remembering only bits of an event), and dissociative amnesia (gaps in memory lasting from minutes to days).</p> <p>Even worse: The damage to the hippocampus from extreme stress not only destroys memories already in the bank but also impairs the creation of new ones. It's as if the whole telephone system-now consisting of severed wires and disconnected calls-shuts down. And the damage, even with new drugs and therapies, is not always reversible. Alexis's experience with a patchwork memory, says Bremner, is fairly typical.</p> <p>As with acute and chronic stress, sex hormones probably play a role in PTSD's effects on memory, but this hasn't been studied in clinical populations. ""PTSD affects two to three times as many women as men,"" says Cahill. ""Nobody knows why. Almost no one is studying it, but they should be."" If they did, perhaps effective treatments would be developed, which could be a huge help at a time when women are on the front lines of two wars and rates of reported domestic abuse are rising.</p> <p>In the meantime, researchers say, these breakthroughs in stress and memory can help women think about-and manage-their own lives. And more information is coming. ""This is a whole new world,"" says Cahill. ""My eyes have been opened.""</p> ",de-stress

For many commuters, that's 25 (or 50) tense minutes a day. If your drive time leaves you feeling tense, it probably leaves your back, spine, and neck feeling like a three-car pile up. ""Commuting is becoming the most stressful part of our day,"" says Darrin Zeer, author of <i>Travel Yoga: Stretches for Planes, Trains, Automobiles, and More!</i> ""Waiting at traffic stop lights makes us uncomfortable and edgy."" Not to mention stiff. Too much travel time can do a number on the body from the head to the feet. Zeer suggests using the time you spend sitting in traffic not fuming but decompressing your car cramp.</p> <p><b>The jam: Breath</b><br />Whether you have a tractor-trailer or a hungry T-rex on your tail, the effect onyour breathingis probably the same-faster and shallower. Best move aside if possible and let the animal pass. Then reset your nervous system with yogic ocean breaths (ujjayi pranayama), which can be done anytime, anywhere (yes, even while operating a vehicle), and it serve to settle the nervous system almost instantaneously. ""Long, slow, deep breaths immediately release tension,"" Zeer says. Here's how: Close your throat. Inhale up the back of your throat for at least four counts, and then strongly exhale the breath through the nose. The warmth and regularity of these breaths soothes the brain and the body to brace you for any ups and downs during your workday. Practice this breathing technique the second your tush meets the driver seat to prepare yourself for the commute. Then use it again when you turn off the ignition. And make it your go-to tool when traffic ties up. Use at least 5 to 8 rounds of this breathing technique in each of the followingtension-curbing exercises.</p><p><b>The jam: Neck</b><br />When traffic comes to a standstill, work out the kinks in your neck by slowly rolling your head around in wide circles. Keep your shoulders down and, when you find a tense spot, hold your head there and take five breaths. Let each exhale release some tightness. Roll your head very slow twice to each side. </p> <p><b>The jam: Shoulders and chest </b><br />While stopped, sit upright with your feet hip-width apart and knees directly over your ankles. Interlace your fingers behind your head and relax your elbows and shoulders so they are limp. With your chest lifted and your chin tucked, stretch your elbows backward. Feel your shoulders loosen and your chest expand. Take five breaths, relax for a few breaths, and repeat. You might even hear a cracking on your exhale.</p><p><b>The jam: Back </b><br />When traffic isn't moving, reach your hands overhead. Inhale deeply, and on your exhale, fold your body forward vertebra by vertebra until your arms and upper body are hanging over your thighs (or the steering wheel) like a rag doll. (This works better if you're not driving.) Take five deep breaths. Next time fold forward and grab either elbow with the opposite hand. The weight of your arms will open up your lower back, letting the stretch creep into your hamstrings too. Feel almost weepy with relaxation? Good.</p> <p><b>The jam: Hips</b><br />Instead of banging the ""on"" button and answering e-mail with lightning speed when you get to your desk, do a pose while your computer boots. Standing next to a wall for balance, place your right foot against the inside of your left thigh (or calf, if that feels better). Then balance by pressing the foot into the standing leg. To open your hips press the leg of the bent knee backward. It won't go far, but the effort opens both hip joints. If you find your foot sliding down the leg, hold the ankle. Stand tall by lifting your sternum and flattening out your back. Take five deep breaths. Switch sides. Then seize the day.</p> ",de-stress

""Plus-size is really the average American woman,"" Banks has said. ""And that woman is healthy."" That woman is also, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 20 pounds overweight. </p><p>In fact, a growing collective of doctors and activists have begun to argue that lifestyle and genetics are what determine a woman's health. Even our new (zaftig) surgeon general, Regina Benjamin, M.D., recently said, ""Being healthy is not about a dress size."" </p><p>That's hopeful news for the 33 percent of Americans who are overweight (this doesn't include the 34 percent who are obese). It's also news a rival camp of experts isn't buying. Any equating of ""overweight"" and ""healthy"" is irresponsible, they say. Especially in a nation where health-care costs have skyrocketed, due in part to the rising rates of illnesses linked to excess pounds. </p><p><b>The Case for Healthy Fat</b><br />For Crystal Renn, bulking up has felt nothing but great. The formerly 95-pound model was once depressed, living on little besides veggies and diet soda. Today, she's forever running between editorial shoots and runway gigs. ""The caliber of work I do is much higher now that I have energy,"" Renn says. She certainly looks healthier, but at 5'9"" and 170 pounds, she's overweight--at least according to her body mass index (BMI).</p><p>Doctors have long used BMI to measure whether a patient is at a healthy weight. Anyone scoring above ""normal"" has been regarded as potentially unwell. But compelling new research shows otherwise, says Paul Campos, author of <i>The Obesity Myth: Why America's Obsession with Weight Is Hazardous to Your Health</i>. ""The correlation between weight and health is greatly exaggerated,"" he says, pointing to studies that found people with an ""overweight"" BMI have lower incidence of lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, anemia, and osteoporosis than their thinner peers. (Being heavier helps fend off osteoporosis, for example, because a little extra mass helps strengthen bones.)</p><p>What's more, a long-term study published in the journal <i>Obesity</i> found that people with ""overweight"" BMI scores have a lower risk of mortality than any other weight group. </p><p>So, hooray for a little junk in the trunk? Yes, some fat can be beneficial, says Konstantinos Manolopoulos, an Oxford University researcher. Pear-shaped women can finally rejoice: Thigh, hip, and butt fat is chemically very stable, and stable fat traps harmful compounds released during digestion. Thigh fat also secretes adiponectin, which helps the body metabolize sugar, and leptin, which regulates appetite.</p><p>Fortified by such science, the fat-acceptance movement pushes another key point: Extra weight may not be ideal, but it sure beats dieting. Research shows extreme yo-yo dieting can, over time, slow metabolism and cause cardiac stress; it can even lead to long-term weight increases. </p><p>Just ask fat-acceptance activist Kate Harding, coauthor of <i>Lessons from the Fat-o-Sphere: Quit Dieting and Declare a Truce with Your Body</i>, who twice lost more than 20 percent of her weight only to regain it. It left her wondering, <i>What if trying so hard not to be fat is actually a bigger health problem than being fat?</i></p><p><b>The Case Against Healthy Fat</b><br />There's no chance dieting is worse, says the anti-fat-acceptance camp. Weight loss may be difficult, but it's still worth pursuing in the name of health. Some research shows that extra weight can increase your risk of developing breast cancer. And overweight women with normal cholesterol and blood pressure levels can still go on to develop heart disease at higher rates, says Barbara Berkeley, M.D., director of weight-management services at the Lakehealth System in Cleveland. ""In other words, being overweight may look 'healthy' but probably isn't once we follow someone over a period of years,"" she says. (But what about those studies that show overweight people live longer and avoid a whole host of diseases? Berkeley argues that the overweight seem to fare better because very underweight people do worse and throw the curve.)</p><p>Then there's that question of fat placement. When you gain weight through overeating, you can't control where the pounds land. Thigh fat might be beneficial, but abdominal fat is not. Nor is dangerous visceral fat, which infiltrates and coats your organs like candle-wax drippings, releasing inflammatory fatty acids that have been linked to cancer and coronary diseases. </p><p>And weight gain can be a slippery slope. In Berkeley's practice, she sees plenty of patients who have let mere love handles escalate into a heaviness that shames them away from the gym or doctor's office. So she opposes any endorsement of being overweight, and maintains that humans, who once had to hunt and gather to survive, evolved to be a lean species.</p><p>She's not alone. Lincoln University recently made headlines when the school set up BMI score graduation requirements: Not under 30? No diploma. (Following a public outcry, the university rescinded the rule.) Both Alabama and North Carolina announced they will charge fat state employees an additional monthly fee for health care. And mega-green grocer Whole Foods started up a voluntary employee incentive programone based, in part, on workers' weights. The lower their BMI, the bigger their discounts. </p><p>After all, explains Berkeley, ""Your heart is only as big as your fist,"" and asking a small muscle to power an overweight frame is ""like putting a little engine in an SUV.""</p><p><b>Beyond BMI</b><br />If the two sides were to agree on anything, it would be this: Fitness is key, and pounds matter less than type of body fat. ""Recently, there have been efforts to look beyond BMI,"" says Margaret Lewin, M.D., clinical assistant professor at Cornell University's Weill Medical College. The old-school measurement does serve a purpose, but its shortcomings are clear. On her blog, Shapely Prose, activist Harding runs a ""BMI project,"" a series of photos of people of different sizes accompanied by their BMI labels. They range from ""underweight"" to ""morbidly obese,"" but for the most part they look, well, pretty normal. Last is a shot of the seemingly healthy Harding, balanced on her hands in the crow yoga pose. Her BMI category? ""Obese."" </p><p>Exercise, everyone concurs, is crucial. It reduces mortality risk by a whopping 50 percent, regardless of weight, says Steven Blair, P.E.D., professor at the University of South Carolina. Aerobic exercise and resistance training attack waistline fat, both the padding you can see and the visceral stuff you can't. Scientists have even found that working out prevents the latter from forming in the first place. In fact, between a plus-size gym-goer and a thin couch potato, the bigger girl is better off, says Blair, and less likely to develop weight-related illnesses. </p><p>That's something to hold on to as the fat-acceptance argument roils. Whether or not extra girth is indeed healthy, everyone should be active. Speaking recently on the <i>Ellen DeGeneres Show</i>, Oscar-winning actress Mo'Nique recounted the moment she decided to shape up. The fat-pride supporter was standing nude before a mirror when her husband asked her how much she weighed. The answer: 262 pounds. ""He said, 'Mama, that's too much. I want you for a lifetime,'"" she recalled. She has since lost 40 pounds. She's certainly not thin--her BMI is likely in the ""obese"" range--but she's working on that visceral fat with exercise. ""Everybody can't be a size zero,"" she has said. ""But let's be healthy, big people."" </p>",Be In The Know

Yep, you read that right. Dancers practice concentrated movements that function as deep sculpting tools to create long, lean muscles. Those coveted results are what have inspired dance-infused fitness programs such as Pure Barre, the total-body workout that combines Pilates, yoga, and dance to target the body areas all women struggle with-core, hips, butt, and arms.</p><p>""Pure Barre is an athletic approach to dance and Pilates,"" says Carrie Rezabek, CEO and founder of Pure Barre Technique. ""It uses calculated isometric movements to work each muscle, then stretches the muscle back out to create long, lean lines-without the bulk.""</p><p>Isometric exercise involves supporting a weight (in this case, your body weight) without moving your muscles-for example, holding a pushup in the lowered position. (That's different from most standard exercises-lunges, crunches, curls-in which you move your muscles through a full range of motion.) ""Keeping your muscles in a fixed position increases the time they're under tension, which makes them stronger,"" says strength and conditioning specialist Mike Mejia, a personal trainer in Plainview, New York.</p><p>Dance-inspired moves are a great way to round out any workout. Here's why:</p><p><strong>They're excuse-proof.</strong><br />A closet-size apartment, no gym membership, or even a bum ankle is no reason to dodge these exercises. Because they don't require big movements or a single piece of equipment, they're perfect for small spaces. ""And they also promote strength and endurance in muscles and joints that have a limited range of motion because of an injury,"" says Meg Lesniak, a trainer at The Sports Club/LA in Miami.</p><p><strong>They'll make you lean but well-rounded.</strong><br />Isometric exercises develop the kind of muscle fibers that are key for endurance and balance. Both are important to your overall fitness, making isometric training an ideal complement to workouts that develop speed and agility, like cardio intervals or plyometrics, Lesniak explains.</p><p><strong>They make you flexible and injury resistant.</strong></p><p>Ever wonder how dancers can bend, twist, and split their bodies-and then stay there? They practice isometric holds at insane angles. When a dancer holds her leg up, the main muscles recruit other, smaller muscle fibers that are often neglected in dynamic exercises. Strengthening these fibers gives them better range of motion, making them more flexible and less prone to injury. And you don't need to make like a pretzel to benefit. You'll become more Gumby-like from any of the moves in ""Go Deep"".</p><p></p><p><strong>Do the Workout</strong><br /></p><p>They may not look like much, but these moves promise big results.<br /><br /><br /><br />Don't be fooled by the tiny movements: While you may not be pumping iron like a power lifter, you will feel the burn during this workout. That's because Pure Barre uses small isometric movements to work each muscle to fatigue, then stretches it out to create long, firm muscle, says Carrie Rezabek, founder and CEO of Pure Barre. And you don't even need a barre to do the workout. As long as you have a support, like a chair or kitchen counter, and a stopwatch or clock, you're good to go.

A family of squirrels seems to have moved into your stomach, your heart feels as if it's clamped in a vise, and though you've emptied a bottle of the natural sleep aid melatonin, you haven't caught a wink all week. No question about it: Losing your one-and-only is a bitch. But stop clutching your chest-the real pain is coming from inside your head.</p><p>If you think you hate being dumped, your brain hates it even more. The region of it that lights up when you're in physical agony also goes haywire when you suffer social rejection, says Naomi Eisenberger, Ph.D., an assistant professor of psychology at the University of California at Los Angeles-evidence, she says, that your head is signaling to your body that being dumped actually hurts.</p><p>Your new singledom isn't helping any either: When you're in love, certain areas of your gray matter are happily awash in dopamine and oxytocin, hormones that give you feelings of pleasure and contentment, says Lucy Brown, Ph.D., a professor of neurobiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. But when your guy suddenly takes off, your supply of those feel-good natural chemicals starts to tumble, leaving you more vulnerable to a whole herd of uncompromising stress hormones.</p><p></p><p></p><p>During any upsetting experience, your brain pumps out cortisol, epinephrine, and other stress hormones, which, in limited quantity, help you react quickly to dangerous situations (like when a car is cutting you off on the highway). However, under long-term trauma, such as heartbreak, accumulating amounts can turn harmful. An overabundance of cortisol tells your brain to send too much blood to your muscles, causing them to tense up, ostensibly for swift action. But you're not leaping anywhere, and as a result you're plagued with swollen muscles that can lead to headaches, a stiff neck, and that awful squeezing sensation in your chest. Cortisol also diverts blood away from your digestive track, leaving you with some serious GI unpleasantness. And to add insult to injury, an overkill of stress hormones can impede your immune system, making you more vulnerable to rogue bacteria and viruses-hence the all-too-common postrelationship cold.</p><p>The particular kind of walloping you suffer also has to do with how your body generally reacts to stress, says Laura Miller, M.D., director of women's mental health at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. If you have a sensitive stomach, you could be prone to breakup cramps, appetite loss, or diarrhea. If you have asthma, you might reach for your inhaler more often; gobs of stress hormones can send your bronchial tubes into overdrive. And if you happen to have an addictive personality, you may feel as shaky as a heroin junkie in rehab, because the area of your brain that processes cravings and addictions is also activated by breakups, according to Brown's recent research.</p><p>The good news: Though you may feel emotionally trampled for a while, you can at least ease your body's pain. And we don't mean with latenight clubbing, nacho binges, and other indulgences, which can lead to more physical woes, such as rapid heartbeat and extreme fatigue, says Gary L. Malone, M.D., chief of psychiatry at Baylor All Saints Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas. Instead, take over-the-counter meds for your pounding head and queasy stomach-or better yet, teach yourself some relaxation techniques (like deep breathing) to calm your nervous system. And curb those wild stress hormones by pulling yourself off the couch for some aerobic exercise, Miller advises. Working out prompts your brain to release uplifting endorphins. Better yet, take a trash-talking friend with you; camaraderie can incite a much-needed pop of your missing oxytocin.</p><p>""One thing you shouldn't do is lock yourself in a room,"" says Gary Lewandowski, Ph.D., an associate professor of psychology at Monmouth University in New Jersey. ""Self-imposed exile will only make things worse."" He advises getting back into some of your favorite pastimes and activities, because doing anything enjoyable can help rev your brain's dopamine system. If you can't disassociate your old passions from moments spent with your ex, take it as an opportunity to try something completely new, like that drawing class or bicycling club you've been coveting (consider how ridiculous he'd look in spandex). Says Lewandowski: ""Whatever cheers the mind may help cure the body."" </p>",Go Green

If you're still skeptical, keep reading: ""Pilates puts your muscles-especially the smaller, stabilizing ones-under constant tension over a large range of motion to create that enviable long, lean look,"" says Lauren Piskin, owner of Physicalmind Studio in New York City. What's more, one study found that women who swapped their usual routines for two 60-minute Pilates sessions a week saw significant increases in abdominal endurance, hamstring flexibility, and upper-body muscular endurance.<br /><br />Problem is, these perks often come with a hefty price tag: A few sessions a week (typically using a bed-size contraption called a Reformer) can set you back hundreds of dollars. So Piskin created this at-home total-body workout, which gives your abs some extra love without damaging your bottom line. All you need is a Pilates ball. ""The ball mimics the resistance of the machine to challenge your muscles as you move through fluid movements,"" says Piskin. Do the following sequence two or three times a week.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/expert-advice-for-staying-hydrated,Fitness,624,284,91,69,10,81,4,0,,Sweating the Details,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/sweating-details.jpg,"Photograph By <b>I've come to Austin, Texas,</b> in the middle of July to sweat. Before I even step off the plane, my pits spring a leak. And they're just warming up: I'm on my way to the Human Performance Lab at the University of Texas to get a scientific read on my perspiration. I can easily soak a sports bra during a workout, but I have no idea whether that's healthy - or how often I should reach for a water bottle to stave off dehydration.<br /><br />Normally, I'm an athletics geek - give me a heart-rate monitor or any other gadget that spits out a numeric assessment of my (hopefully) improving fitness, and I'm as happy as an iPhone beta tester. But hydration? <i>Bleh</i>. Where's the cool data or graph-able output in that?<br /><br />I arrive at the lab, strip down, and weigh in. After throwing on cycling shorts and a tank top, I pedal a stationary bike inside a chamber whose temperature is set to sweltering: 92 degrees with 50 percent humidity. Thirty minutes later, I'm drenched. I get naked again and discover that I've lost more than three-fourths of a pound. Yikes. Seems like a lot.<br /><br />Lab director Ed Coyle, Ph.D., spends a few minutes crunching the numbers, combining my weight loss with the amount of water I drank while cycling to arrive at my sweat rate: 1.7 liters (that's 3.6 pounds of water) an hour (about the amount in one of those ginormous bottles of soda). When Coyle tells me that athletic performance starts to suffer once you lose about 2 percent of your body weight - and I would've lost more than that if I'd pedaled a whole hour - I really start to worry. I'm currently training for a marathon in conditions just slightly less hellish than those in the chamber. Um, maybe I should give hydration a little more attention?<br /><br />I'm not the only one who needs to: Even though Americans down more than 90 million bottles of water a day, few people know how much liquid loving their body really needs. ""I'm amazed at how many conflicting reports there are,"" Coyle says. ""But staying hydrated isn't that complicated."" To understand it better, tap into these six revelations I learned while sweating my butt off. You can raise a Gatorade to me later.<br /><br /><b>Eight Glasses, My Ass</b><p></p><p>As a rule, the more active you are, the more water you need. In fact, the newest hydration guidelines for athletes, issued this year by the American College of Sports Medicine, are nowhere near one-size-fits-all. The 14-page document boils down to this: Start your workout with a full tank, then replenish your fluids based on your pre- and post-workout weight.<br /><br />Here's a more specific game plan:<br /><br /><b>4 hours before your workout:</b> Drink 12 ounces of fluid, then weigh yourself. If your urine is the shade of apple juice or darker, plan to gulp 8 to 12 more ounces 2 hours before you exercise.<br /><br /><b>During your workout:</b> Replenish with a 16-ounce sports drink every hour, or 4 ounces every 15 minutes. Drink more if you're working out at a high intensity for longer than an hour.<br /><br /><b>Post workout:</b> Weigh yourself again. Drink 16 ounces (think of filling a pint glass) per pound you've lost. If you gained weight, you're drinking too much.<br /><br /><b>Dehydration Makes You Suck at Everything</b></p><p>Water is a multitasker: Among other things, it lubes your muscles, transports nutrients around your system, and shuttles waste out of it, allowing your kidneys to function smoothly. Every sweat bead on your skin equals less water in your system. When you've sweated out 1 percent of your body weight, two things happen (and continue to happen with every additional 1 percent lost): Your heart rate rises 7 beats per minute in order to push your thickening blood through your body, and your core temperature increases a third of one degree.<br /><br />Lose 2 percent, and not only are you physically suffering (your pace slows), but your brain starts going blotto - it's 80 percent water, so it short-circuits at the first sign of a drought. (Maybe that's why I wasn't worried about hydration; I was delusional.) Your reaction times become longer and you have trouble finessing certain tasks, like dribbling or steering. Dry out even more, and you may get headaches, cramps, and dizziness as your body loses its ability to transport blood as efficiently. Lose 15 percent of your body weight and you should start praying like a Catholic schoolgirl during finals: Your body is too dried out to stay alive.<br /><br /><b>Chugging Is for Frat Boys</b></p><p>Regardless of what's in your water bottle, resist the urge to gulp it all down the instant your workout ends. In fact, sip no more than 16 ounces an hour. If you try to drink more than that after exercise, you'll be lulled into a false sense of security. ""Your system can't process bottles of water rapidly,"" Coyle explains. ""Your urine will be clear long before you're hydrated."" In other words, you'll be glued to the toilet but won't necessarily get the benefits of whatever you drank. If you plan to exercise twice in one day, the ACSM recommends drinking about 20 to 24 ounces for every pound lost to compensate for the extra urine you'll produce. But for your average day with one hour-long gym session, drinking 16 ounces per pound lost over the day is sufficient.</p><p><b>There's No Perfect Pour</b></p><p>The weather (or lack thereof, if you're a gym rat) and your intensity influence more than anything how much you sweat. And as temps shift, so does the need to pay attention to hydration. One study by the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine and published in the <i>Journal of Applied Physiology</i> found that a 3 percent drop in cyclists' body weight reduced performance by a substantial 8 percent when it was 68 degrees but hardly affected them at 36 degrees.<br /><br />Clothing matters too. The main function of sweat is to work as your personal AC: When your sweat hits the air, it evaporates and keeps you cool. Wicking fabrics, like polyester and other fancy lab-brewed materials, pull sweat away from the skin and dry quickly, allowing your system to work even more efficiently than Ma Nature engineered. Although studies have proven that wearing cotton - which, when wet, forms a barrier between your skin and the air - doesn't increase your core temperature, wearing it during intense exercise in cold weather, like snowshoeing, does put you at greater risk for hypothermia.<br /><br />How often you hit the treadmill - or pavement or bike trail - also determines your sweat potential. ""It sounds counterintuitive, but the fitter you are, the sooner your body begins to sweat, so a person who's in extremely good shape will produce more sweat than somebody who isn't,"" says Beth Stover, M.S., C.S.C.S., a senior scientist at the Gatorade Sports Science Institute in Barrington, Illinois. ""With each workout, you become a more and more efficient sweating machine.""<br /><br /><b>I Sweat Like a Dude</b></p><p>Ask any unlucky soul who has mopped down a treadmill after a bare-chested man strutted his stuff: Guys pour it on more than women. University of Texas researchers studied 132 triathletes and found that women lost an average of 1.2 liters an hour during moderate-intensity exercise in a warm environment, while men pumped out 1.6 liters. (Yes, people, I dumped 0.1 liter more than the average man, but I'm also not an average woman: I'm 6-foot-3 and weigh 175 pounds.)</p><p><b>Hit the Bottle ASAP if...</b></p><p>... two of these factors are apparent:<br /><br /><b>1. </b>You can see your pee: If it's dark yellow in the morning, or you're peeing less than once every 4 hours, you need to drink. Also, a properly hydrated person should pee once a night.<br /><br /><b>2.</b> You feel thirsty: Okay, duh. But the must-drink-now urge doesn't kick in until you're already drying up.<br /><br /><b>3.</b> You're losing weight. If you lose more than 1 percent of your weight - but are still eating your normal amount of chow - every day for 3 or more days, you may be dehydrated.<br /><br /></p>","hydration,Getting Started"

Par for the season: lazy afternoons at the beach, abbreviated workdays, and long breaks away from the daily grind.This year, though, you might be working extra hours and staying closer to home to save some cash. But there are still plenty ways to relax and rejuvenate. </p><p>The key is to learn how to ""disengage"" from daily stress. ""When you're taking fewer days off, it's especially important to find ways to unwind during the downtime you do have,"" says Katherine Muller, Psy. D., director of the cognitive behavior therapy program at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City.</p><p>Squashing stress isn't just good for your sanity-it's good for your physical health. Stress has been linked to every major illness in the U. S., including heart disease, cancer, and depression. </p><p>Going nonstop day in and day out takes a toll on the entire body, says Dov Eden, Ph. D., one of the world's leading vacation researchers and a professor at Tel Aviv University. But, Eden says, learning to apply a vacation mentality to your daily life can put you back on your game. </p><p>These tips will help you reach a state of blissful detachment, no matter where you are or how many days off you can swing. </p><p>Squashing stress isn't just good for your sanity-it's good for your physical health.

D., one of the world's leading vacation researchers and a professor at Tel Aviv University. But, Eden says, learning to apply a vacation mentality to your daily life can put you back on your game.</p><p>These tips will help you reach a state of blissful detachment, no matter where you are or how many days off you can swing.</p><p><strong>Unplug Yourself from the Office</strong><br />Experts say we've become so obsessed with always being on that we've lost the ability to turn ourselves off. And that can pile on stress.</p><p>More than a third of the participants in a recent study, published in the journal Heart, felt frazzled by a sense of obligation to respond immediately to their constant barrage of e-mails. Women also feel more pressure to hit REPLY. But ""just because you own a PDA doesn't mean it has to be on all the time,"" Muller says. ""Each night, block 30 minutes for e-mail. When the time's up, turn off the device and put it out of sight."" </p><p>Just don't schedule your catch-up session right before bed. ""Hitting the sack with work on your brain makes it tough to transition into sleep mode, so put the kibosh on all business-related correspondence at least an hour before turning in,"" she says.</p><p><strong>Create a Chill-Out Routine</strong><br />In the same way a pre-bedtime ritual puts you in the mood for sleep, a pre-downtime routine helps you get in the mood for relaxation. </p><p>As soon as you arrive home, shed whatever reminds you of work: stash your bag out of sight and kick off your heels. ""Changing your outfit can change your mindset instantly,"" Muller says. </p><p>Next, do something that offers a change of pace, recommends Susan J. Nathan, Ph. D., a health psychologist in Laguna Hills, California. ""If you're a desk drone, head outside for a run or a swim; if you're on your feet all day, ease into a warm bath. Soon you'll feel yourself mentally drifting away from what stresses you out."" </p><p><strong>Take It Outside</strong><br />Mother Nature may be the ultimate antidepressant. Exposure to natural light can increase levels of the mood-lifting chemical serotonin, says NYU psychologist Robert Reiner, Ph. D. </p><p>Research also shows that spending time outdoors is hugely important in preventing depression. ""The expansive space, colors, and fresh air can all help your brain disengage,"" Nathan says. </p><p>She recommends trading your gym routine for outdoor exercise or eating lunch al fresco: ""Try to notice every detail using all your senses-the shapes in the clouds, the taste of your lemonade, the warm breeze on your back."" </p><p><strong>Find a Balance Between Rest and Activity</strong><br />When the weekend finally arrives, sometimes you're so determined to have fun that you try to cram in 147 things before Monday. </p><p>But a jam-packed weekend can actually leave you more exhausted and stressed. ""Even enjoyable activities can wear you out if you shoehorn too many into one weekend,"" Muller says. </p><p>She recommends carving out a half-hour each day just to chill. Try using the time to read (a study from England's University of Sussex found that reading can slash stress by 68 percent), listen to music (61 percent), or sip a cup of tea (54 percent). </p><p>Don't flip on the tube unless there's a show you really want to see. ""Even though watching TV seems like a great way to zone out, mindless surfing actually stimulates your nervous system and thwarts your ability to relax,"" Nathan says. </p><p><strong>Plan Long Weekends</strong><br />If you can't afford a full week away from work, put in for a few Mondays or Fridays instead. Experts say that taking mini-vacations can sufficiently recharge your batteries. (And since you'll be missing only one day of work, you won't have overflowing voicemail or e-mail to contend with when you return.) </p><p>""When we examined how vacation length affects stress levels, we found that taking several short breaks may be more beneficial than taking one long one,"" Eden says. </p><p>To get the most out of an extended weekend, you still have to seek out a slight change of scenery. ""Physical separation can lead to mental separation from stressors,"" Nathan says. Check into a nearby B&B for a night, go on an all-day hike, or even just visit a new restaurant across town.</p><p><strong>Become an Escape Artist</strong><br />To sufficiently drag your brain out of the work gutter, you need to reset it. The best way to do that is through what psychologists call escapism. That means getting out of the house and experiencing something that transports the mind-think movies, concerts, art exhibitions, comedy shows, sporting events. </p><p>""An activity like watching a movie is the metaphorical equivalent of going to Hawaii,"" says James Amirkhan, Ph. D., a psychology professor at California State University Long Beach. ""It lets you mentally check out and remove yourself from the problems in your everyday life."" </p><p>If thoughts of the office intrude while you're enjoying a baseball game or a summer blockbuster, just briefly acknowledge them and then refocus, Muller says. Redirect your attention toward the sound of the crowd, the taste of your hot dog, or the way Ryan Reynolds's eyes twinkle when he smiles. </p><p><strong>Get a Hobby</strong><br />Keeping your hands busy settles your mind. Just ask any knitter. Summertime activities that require repetitive motion, such as barbecuing (place burger on grill, flip, serve, repeat) or gardening (dig, plant, water, repeat), can lower blood pressure and heart rate. </p><p>""Repetitive motion works like a meditation mantra: It shuts down the body's fight-or-flight response,"" Reiner says. </p><p>You zero in on the task in front of you, taking your mind off looming deadlines and other upcoming events. For optimal chill-out effect, keep your sessions brief; Reiner advises 20-minute spurts. ""The mind-soothing benefits of repetition dwindle the longer you participate in the activity,"" he says. </p><p><strong>Stop Tension In Its Tracks</strong><br />""Once stress escalates, it becomes tougher to let it go,"" says anxiety expert and clinical psychologist Tamar Chansky, Ph. D. ""The secret is to counteract it as soon as it hits."" Luckily, it doesn't take long to feel zen again. Next time you feel overwhelmed, try one of these 60-second tension busters: </p><p>1. Go on a tear. Ripping paper to shreds offers serious relief. ""Hearing a satisfying rip gives you something to focus on, and the physical act of shredding something without causing real harm releases tension,"" Chansky says. </p><p>2. Share a joke. Cracking up increases feel-good endorphins and decreases stress hormones such as cortisol and epinephrine, say researchers at the University of California, Irvine. </p><p>3. Just breathe. Achieve inner peace with this quick breathing exercise from Judith Orloff, M. D., assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA. First, conjure up an image that makes you feel tranquil, then close your eyes and take eight deep breaths, paying attention to the air filling your chest. Exhale with a sigh, imagining all the tension in your body evaporating. ""Slow breaths help reduce stress hormones in the body,"" Orloff says. And a calmer you is a happier you. </p>",de-stress

One easy way to judge your pre-program fitness level? Check out your squatting form.</p><p>Your squatting form can tell you a lot about where you're tight, where you're weak, and overall what you need to work on in your program. It's best if a fitness professional trained in the Functional Movement Screen assesses you, but there are some simple observations you can make on your own to get the gist of what you need to know.</p><p><strong>The Test</strong><br />Start by standing in front of a mirror with your feet just outside of shoulder width, toes facing forward with your arms straight ahead. Maintain an upright torso and keep your heels down as you squat as low as you can go, keeping your arms ahead. Perform facing the mirror and sideways to the mirror.</p><p>Five questions to ask yourself as you are performing the overhead bodyweight squat:</p><p>1. Are you unable to get your hips below your knees, achieving a full range of motion squat, while keeping your heels down and arms overhead?</p><p>2. Do your knees collapse in?</p><p>3. Do you lean to one side, shifting your weight? You'll see this when facing the mirror by watching your hips to see if they shift to one side.</p><p>4. Does your torso bend forward beyond parallel with your shins? Your back should be parallel or more vertical than your shins. If you feel your back rounding forward take note.</p><p>5. Are your arms drifting down as you squat?</p><p>If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, your squat form is improper-a clear sign that your body is compensating due to something being tight or weak. Some possibilities: ""Most commonly, tight ankles, lats, and a lack of mobility in the upper back along with short hip flexors are the reason you can't perform a bodyweight squat with good form,"" says Mike Wunsch, FMS Level 2, CSCS. ""In addition, lacking core stability can be an issue.""</p><p><strong>How to Improve Your Form</strong><br />One of the easiest places to get started fixing your body's inefficiencies is to train the squat movement de-loaded with the right form. Using a tool such as a TRX band to hold on to, you can build up strength doing the squat properly. Hold on to the TRX, taking some of your body weight off, as much as you need to, in order to squat with full range of motion, keeping your heels down and torso upright. As you practice that movement you'll see improvement and will eventually be able to squat with good form without the help of the TRX.</p><p>In addition to adding de-loaded squats to your program, you should also include core stability exercises such as planks. ""The lack of core stability is one of the primary limiting factors when performing an overhead squat,"" says Craig Rasmussen, also FMS level 2, CSCS.</p><p>You should also include stretches to improve your range of motion for your ankles, hip flexors and lats while using a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/relieve-sore-muscles"">foam roller</a>, especially on your upper back.</p><p>After taking on this training regimen, re-test your squat every couple weeks, to track your progress. Once you can perform a full range of motion squat with your heels down, torso upright, and arms straight ahead, you'll know you're ready to take on more intense fitness programs.</p> <p><strong>More from WH:</strong><br /><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/trx-total-body-workout"">Total-Body TRX Workout</a><br /><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/body-weight-exercises"">Best Bodyweight Exercises</a><br /><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/relieve-sore-muscles"">Soothe Muscle Soreness with a Foam Roller</a></p><p></p>",

Some of the <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/best-workouts-for-women"">best workouts for women</a> incorporate superfast explosive movements-plyometrics-to fire up your fitness level by improving your coordination and agility. And one University of Nebraska study found that participants who improved their vertical jump also logged significantly faster 10-K running times. Even better: All that bounding and leaping builds lean muscle mass, your express ticket to a sleeker shape.<br /><br />In trainer-speak, these moves are called plyometrics, and they're one of the most effective ways to torch calories and burn serious fat. ""Plyometric exercises-whether they're jumps or quick upper-body movements-increase the elastic properties of your muscles, which over time allows them to handle intense workloads more efficiently,"" says Diane Vives, owner of Fit4Austin and president of Vives Training Systems in Austin, Texas. The result: Your muscles adapt to more challenging <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/workouts"">fitness workouts</a> faster, so you see body-shaping results sooner.<p></p><p>And the benefits of plyometrics are more than muscle deep: New research shows that these moves may also be the key to stronger bones. ""Your bones constantly go through a rebuilding process to maintain healthy density,"" says Vives. And the best way to trigger that rebuilding is by stressing your bones with explosive movements, according to a 2009 review in <i>Sports Medicine</i>. Since bone density peaks between ages 25 and 30, and then decreases by 1 to 2 percent a year, now is the time to start showing your skeleton some love. The higher your bone density is before it begins thinning, the lower your risk for osteoporosis later on. </p><p></p>Vives crafted this routine to strengthen your cardiovascular system and tone your muscles at the same time-the ultimate one-two punch for igniting your fat burning engine. Complete this heart pumping circuit two or three days a week on non consecutive days. Do all of the moves without resting in between, then rest for a minute or two.

Regular 30-minute workouts speed the release of epinephrine, your body's natural decongestant.</p><p><strong>You're breaking out</strong><br />When tense, your body pumps out extra adrenaline that prompts the emission of sebum, your skin's pimple-causing oil. As production of one goes up, so does the other.<br /><strong>Chill out:</strong> Wash problem areas twice a day. Gel- or foam-based cleansers are best for dissolving oil. If those don't cut the grease, ask your derm for a sebum-busting retinoid cream.</p><p><strong>Your scalp is patchy</strong><br />Anxiety may put your strands into no-grow mode because stress hormones can interfere with hair growth.<br /><strong>Chill out:</strong> Make sure you're getting enough iron, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin B12, all of which promote hair health.

The heat will relax your muscles and help cut down on grinding. Not working? See your dentist to get fitted for a mouth guard.</p><p><strong>You're ravenous for junk food</strong><br />High levels of cortisol, your body's stress hormone, can prompt you to crave sweets.

And its enigmatic nature just might be preventing us from fully realizing the damage <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/stress-signs"">stress</a> can do-to our minds, bodies, and spirits.<br /><br />According to the American Psychological Association, more than half of all women say they're ""highly stressed,"" an increase of 25 percent from just four years ago. But very few do anything to chill out. In fact, many seem to be saying ""bring it on!"" because somewhere along the line being stretched to the limit turned into a badge of honor.<br /><br />That's how it was for Meredith Bodgas, 28, of Forest Hills, New York. Before switching to a lower-key Web job, Bodgas worked until 9 p.m. most nights. ""I figured anyone who left before 7 p.m. simply wasn't as valuable,"" she says. She subscribed to the same misguided belief adopted by so many modern women: Stress is synonymous with success-and if you're not totally fried, you may not be doing enough. ""I loved it when people would ask me 'How do you do it?' "" admits Bodgas, ""even though I suspect what some of them really meant was 'Why do you do it?' ""<br /><br /><b>Stress Appeal</b><br />Turns out, high anxiety may be, well, an actual high.<br /><br />""Some people think they need to be stressed all the time in order to really feel alive,"" says Patt Lind-Kyle, author of <i>Heal Your Mind, Rewire Your Brain: Applying the Exciting New Science of Brain Synchrony for Creativity, Peace, and Presence</i>. They become hooked on the rush they get from stress, which stimulates hormones such as adrenaline, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and especially cortisol. The tension can become addictive-and as with most addictions, it can usher in an unhealthy craving.<br /><br />The ready willingness to put out a welcome mat for stress also stems from myriad social and cultural pressures. While you'd think the feminist movement would have moved women way past this by now, ""many still feel driven to prove they can be just as successful as their male counterparts,"" says stress researcher KaMala Thomas, Ph.D., an assistant professor of psychology at Pitzer College in California.<br /><br />""In fact, studies show that women expect to juggle multiple roles from an early age. The result is that they end up thriving on stress and feeling guilty if they're not multitasking. They get used to the adrenaline rush and eventually interpret stress as a drive to be productive rather than a potential source of long-term health problems.""<br /><br />Compounding this is the possibility that women embrace stress because, somewhere along the way, they came to believe that the more frazzled they are, the better person they are. ""Many young women think if they're not working every second of every day, they're lazy,"" says Steve Orma, Psy.D., a clinical psychologist in San Francisco.<br /><br />""They are ashamed of taking breaks and feel they're not a 'good' enough person if they aren't pushing themselves to the absolute limit. It has become a moral issue.""<br /><br />Plus, a lot of women are willing to forgo sleep and sanity for an implied payoff. In Bodgas's case, she figured the more hours she clocked-and the higher her stress meter continued to soar-the greater her reward would be. ""I felt as if I were one of those pledging frat guys who tells himself that the fraternity must be amazing if he has to go through so much horrible stuff to get in,"" she says.<br /><br /><b>No Rest for the Weary</b><br />Sometimes stress does have a higher purpose. For example, cortisol surges during critical times of acute angst-say, when an important work file goes missing-because it kicks your brain and butt into gear (Oh, you left it in Julia's office!). The problem begins when stress becomes a steady state of being. ""After your cortisol rises, it's supposed to come right back down and not stay elevated,"" says Pamela W. Smith, M.D., author of What You Must Know About Women's Hormones. ""When you're stressed for a long time, your body's stores of cortisol become too low and you don't have enough for your body to run at its optimal level."" What's more, once cortisol stays elevated for longer than 24 hours, certain nutrients (such as B vitamins) get depleted, and cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels can skyrocket. Coursing cortisol can also trigger free radicals that could eventually damage neurons, affecting your short-and long-term memory and your ability to think clearly.<br /><br />Today, two-thirds of all office visits to primary-care physicians are related to stress. ""Elevated stress can suppress the immune system, increase appetite, impact sex drive, affect fertility, and on and on,"" explains Shawn M. Talbott, Ph.D., a biochemical nutritionist in Salt Lake City and author of <i>The Cortisol Connection:Why Stress Makes You Fat and Ruins Your Health-and What You Can Do About It.</i><br /><br />""It can also lead to behavioral changes such as excessive drinking, smoking, and bingeing on 'comfort' food, as well as lack of motivation.""<br /><br />And it turns out that all that ill-advised, frenzied one-upmanship-especially in the workplace-might be futile: The number one reason employees go on disability leave? You guessed it: Stress.<br /><br /><b>Getting an Attitude Adjustment</b><br />To step off the stress hamster wheel, you need to start making a conscious effort to catch yourself in the act of gloating, ""I'm so stressed out."" Similarly, you may think that responding to a friend's stress bravado with a play-by-play of your own overwhelming schedule is akin to being supportive. It's not. Stop being an enabler and lose the one-upping in favor of a softer, healthier approach, says Orma. Try saying something like, ""Wow, it sounds like you have a tough week ahead. What will you do to take care of yourself?"" Says Orma: ""Gently encouraging a harried pal to take some downtime will be more helpful to both of you than swapping stress stories.""<br /><br />Next, get real about your overflowing agenda and try to edit out unnecessary and time-consuming activities (good-bye, IM). Taking small steps toward whittling your to-do list can put you back in control of your life-a position that delivers just as much euphoria as a stress high.<br /><br /><i><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/stress-busters"">Learn how to outsmart common stress traps!</a></i><br />",de-stress

But how you handle that stress has major implications for your long-term health. Turns out dwelling on daily stressors can double your risk of chronic health problems, according to a study published in the <em>Annals of Behavioral Medicine</em>.</p><p>Researchers interviewed 435 people, asking them about the daily stresses they experienced, their mood, and the physical health symptoms they had. The interviews were conducted between 1995 and 1996 and then again 10 years later. The authors also analyzed participants' levels of the stress hormone cortisol from saliva samples. They found that participants who dwelled on the small stressors, rather than letting the problems roll off their backs, were twice as likely to report an increase in chronic health problems 10 years later. The most common conditions reported: Pain (like arthritis and fibromyalgia), cardiovascular disease, and gastrointestinal problems.</p><p><strong>How Stress Impacts the Body</strong><br />It's not news that stress can negatively impact your health. In the short term, people who experience stress are more likely to report headaches, stomach problems, anxiety, and decreased productivity. Stress can also affect memory and cognitive performance: You're more likely to forget things and perform worse on cognitive tasks, as if you had the brain of someone about 6 years older, says study author David Almeida, Ph.D., professor of human development and family studies at Penn State University.</p><p>Almeida's study is one of the first to look at the long-term effects of stress, however. As for why stress can leave lasting damage over a decade, Almeida has two theories. The first: ""When we get upset in the face of stressors, we have increases in cortisol, or disruptions to our daily physiology. Over time, this could place the body at risk [for health problems]."" For example, spikes in cortisol cause heart rate to increase, which make your cardiovascular system work harder.</p><p>His other theory is purely behavioral: When people are experiencing stress, they're less likely to engage in the types of things that improve health, like exercising and eating well.</p><p><strong>How to Manage Stress in a Healthy Way</strong><br />Almeida maintains that stress in and of itself isn't bad.""In the end, it's healthy to have stressors in our lives-that means we have challenge in our lives,"" Almeida says. ""But we have to be aware of how we respond to these challenges.""</p><p>""If you're carrying it with you when you go to sleep or if it disrupts your going to sleep then you're certainly dwelling.""</p><p><strong>Try these tips for managing frustration and improving your mood:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Break a Sweat</strong><br />If at all possible, find an outlet for physical activity and exercise, Almeida says. It's only natural. ""We've evolved to mobilize energy in the face of a stressor,"" he says. Heart rate goes up and glucose is sent to all parts of our bodies, but ""our modern-day response to that is to sit and work out the challenge mentally when our bodies are saying 'go out and do something.'""</p><p>If you know in advance that a certain day is going to be stressful, schedule a workout for that morning. If, instead, you've been blindsided by tension, make a point to hit the gym in the evening or work out at home. (Chill out with this <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/video/yoga/relaxing-yoga-the-perfect-calm-it-all-routine#/video/all"">relaxing yoga</a> routine.)</p><p><strong>2. Be Solution-Oriented</strong><br />""Try to focus on solving the problem if it's solvable, rather than focusing on your emotions about the problem,"" Almeida says. Make a list of all the steps you need to take to get something accomplished and then cross them off as you complete them. When you see that you're making progress on smaller, more manageable tasks, the job as a whole will feel less overwhelming, Dan Ariely, Ph.D., a professor of psychology and economics at Duke University who studies irrational behavior.</p><p><strong>3. Laugh It Off</strong><br />The people who do best at not dwelling are those who have some sort of positive outlook on life, Almeida says. ""In the face of challenge they can maintain joy, happiness, or humor-that seems to help a lot in limiting the duration of the stress response,"" he says.</p><p>Research shows that smiling and laughing increase feel-good endorphins. Cracking up also causes levels of the stress hormones to plummet. Your laughter Rx? Hit up Buzzfeed.com and belly-laugh at animal photos or watch a YouTube clip from your favorite comedian.</p><p><strong>4. Count Your Blessings</strong><br />Being grateful can help calm you down. In a study published in <em>Applied Physiology</em>, people who focused on <a href=""http://blog.womenshealthmag.com/glow/be-grateful/"">feeling grateful</a> at bedtime were less worried and anxious and their overall sleep quality was better compared to previous nights.<strong> </strong>To improve your mood and outlook, make a list of five things for which you're grateful every night, no matter how small.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>5. Massage It Out</strong><br />A rub doesn't just make your muscles feel good-it can also do wonders for your anxiety. When the nerves in your skin sense firm pressure, your brain activates your parasympathetic nervous system. As a result, your adrenal glands cut back the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and vasopressin and your brain boosts production of the feel-good neurotransmitter serotonin. (Here's how to give yourself an amazing <a href=""http://blog.womenshealthmag.com/thisjustin/diy-5-ways-to-give-yourself-an-amazing-massage/"">DIY massage</a> right now.)</p><p><strong>6. Eat Your Veggies</strong><br />New research shows that happiness is highest among people who eat seven servings of fruits and vegetables per day. The more good-for-you foods people ate, the more likely they were to report satisfaction and happiness and the less likely they were to experience nervousness and ""feeling low."" The positive effects topped out at seven servings, which might seem like a lot but it's doable.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/good-to-cry,Health,568,248,251,15,3,17,7,0,,Why Women Cry (And Should!),http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1103-go-flow.jpg,"<p>On a recent flight from New York to Los Angeles, I had a sudden urge to cry. I'd just said good-bye to my goddaughter after a wonderful weekend visit, and being with her reminded me of just how badly I wanted to be somebody's mom and how that wasn't working out so well.</p><p>At first I fought the feeling, mostly because I didn't want to alarm the flight attendants. But also because my seatmate was a rather serious-looking man in a suit reading <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i> and I was loathe to make the six hours I had to share an intimate space with him any more awkward than it needed to be.</p><p>So I pulled out an arsenal of reading material from my bag and willed myself to pull it together. But I just couldn't snuff out the hollow feeling in my stomach or the burning sensation in my throat, and before I knew it, tears were slipping out of the corners of my eyes. Suit guy nervously asked if I was OK. ""Oh, you're so sweet,"" I replied, mopping my tears away with the drink napkin he'd gently handed me. ""I'm fine, really."" And I meant it. Crying-however ill-timed, humiliating, or unattractive-always makes me feel better.</p><p>I'm actually a naturally sunny person. I look on the bright side, and my glass is usually half full. But while I have a master's degree in happiness, I have a Ph.D. in crying. Of course, we all have those seminal moments in our lives that fling open the floodgates. I cried when my heart was broken by my first love back in high school, and when my husband, Jason, proposed (and throughout our vows at our wedding). I cried when Newman, our beloved dog of 15 years, died in my arms, and I cried tears of joy when Barack Obama became our first black president. Lately, though, I've been a particularly active geyser because I can't get pregnant-hence, the airplane sobfest.</p><p>Unfortunately, these days crying gets a bad rap, especially when the crier is a woman. Studies show that when <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/men-crying"">men cry</a>, they are viewed sympathetically, while women are often labeled dramatic, irrational, or manipulative if they turn on the faucet. When Hillary Clinton nearly broke down once-<i>once!</i>-on the campaign trail in 2008, the public (and the press) were divided. While some applauded her rare display of vulnerability, others saw it as a sign that she was simply too fragile (read: female) to hold the highest office. It seems that while it's now socially acceptable for women to be CEOs and soldiers, it's no longer appropriate for us to weep openly. We're expected to suck it up, or in the infamous words of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, <i>man up.</i></p><p>Well, I think it's time we reclaim our right to cry. A good cry is a purging of sorts-it unburdens me of all the mental baggage I've been lugging around town. Crying often gives me the clarity I need to make a big, important decision, and I can count on it to put me in touch with my empathy for other people. It's the steam valve on my emotional teakettle.</p><p>And as it turns out, there's a scientific basis to what I've always innately known: Crying has valuable mental and physical benefits. Tears banish stress hormones such as cortisol as well as other toxins that accumulate when we feel stressed, says Judith Orloff, M.D., an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California at Los Angeles and author of <i>Emotional Freedom: Liberate Yourself from Negative Emotions and Transform Your Life.</i></p><p>""Crying is our natural, built-in healing system,"" she explains. ""It can release stress and tension."" I was so happy to hear this validating news that I almost-you got it-cried!</p><p>And while shedding tears is healthy, even I know that sometimes it's not appropriate. While tears in response to a sad or traumatic event (a death in the family or a bad breakup, for example) are expected and understood, crying over sour grapes (you didn't get the office space you asked your boss for) is almost always judged negatively, says Stephanie Shields, Ph.D., a professor of psychology and women's studies at Penn State.</p><p>So if you do feel tears welling up at an inopportune moment, just try not to let them runneth over: A study at Penn State found that moist eyes are a sign of emotion under control, which is the most favorably perceived response of all.</p><p>Some might say that bawling in front of a perfect stranger who is silently trying to enjoy his newspaper on a long flight isn't such a hot idea either. But I have to disagree. Letting my tears flow that day sparked a meaningful conversation between the two of us. My seatmate confided that he and his wife had also struggled with infertility, and then he pulled out a photograph of his daughter, whom they had just adopted. His eyes lit up when he looked at her smiling little face.</p><p>Which brings me to my final point about crying: Showing emotion and vulnerability can bring you closer to people-strangers, friends, family members, romantic partners, and most important, yourself. It's one of the things that sets us apart from other species. It's what makes us human. It's what makes us real.</p><p>Andrea Buchanan is the editor of <i>Live and Let Love: Notes from Extraordinary Women on the Layers, the Laughter, and the Litter of Love </i>(Gallery Books, February 2011).</p>",

Now, studies are finding upsides to other so-called bad behaviors. Some things-like smoking or an addiction to cookies 'n' cream-we'd never endorse, but these six naughty habits can feel good and be good for you.</p><p><strong>Getting pissed off can keep stress in check.</strong><br />A little anger may be a tonic for both your mind and body. For example, new studies suggest that riled-up people make better decisions. And researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that anger-as opposed to fear or anxiety-can prompt your brain to release less cortisol, the powerful stress hormone linked to problems like obesity, bone loss, and heart disease. ""Traditionally, it has been difficult for women to express anger effectively, because we're 'supposed' to act nurturing and sensitive,"" says Julie K. Norem, Ph.D., author of <em>The Positive Power of Negative Thinking</em>. So let your ire out. Just don't go overboard; chronic rage is unproductive.</p><p><strong>Downing coffee could cut your cancer risk.</strong><br />Coffee's most exalted attribute-energy-boosting caffeine-has nothing on its real health superpowers. Studies show that drinking daily joe may minimize your risk for Parkinson's disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Why? Most chronic diseases are related to inflammation, and coffee is chock-full of anti-inflammatory compounds, says Shelley McGuire, Ph.D., an associate professor of nutrition at Washington State University. Coffee also has more antioxidants than almost any other food. Sip one to three high-octane or decaf cups a day, but make sure you steer clear of fat traps such as whipped-cream-topped lattes. ""If you're piling on calories,"" warns McGuire, ""you're probably wiping out the benefits.""</p><p><strong>Being a slob may help you breathe easier.</strong><br />Messy women everywhere cheered when a British study found that an unmade bed could nix in-house allergens (turns out, tucked-in sheets can offer dust mites a covered breeding area). But here's even more encouraging news for the not-so-tidy: Environmental and internal medicine expert Kenneth Rosenman, M.D., says you should focus on keeping your home reasonably clean, not entirely pristine. ""The huge push to disinfect our homes isn't healthy,"" he explains. ""A little messiness is OK."" Zapping every germ around-including the harmless ones-can clear the way for more serious or resistant strains. Plus, certain household disinfectant sprays and air fresheners release chemicals that can heighten asthma risk. Skip spray cleaners in favor of environmentally friendly pourable ones-and don't forget that a simple clean damp cloth can do wonders.</p><p><strong>Drinking beer may benefit your heart and bones.</strong><br />Go ahead, crack open that brewski: Research indicates that beer could be an even better heart-disease fighter than red wine, says Charles Bamforth, Ph.D., a professor of food science and technology at the University of California at Davis. The refreshing stuff is made with malted barley, which happens to contain the same heart-protecting antioxidants that give red wine its good name. But beer also packs high levels of vitamin B6, which keeps our bodies from building up homocysteine, a chemical linked to increased coronary risk. And your whole body gets a boost in the form of silica, a compound that helps strengthen bones. Bamforth suggests sticking to one beer a day. Look for brews made with ample pale malt and hops (i.e., pale ales), which are especially rich in silica.</p><p><strong>Surfing the Internet might tune up your brain.</strong><br />All that online shopping may yield more than a fab pair of heels. A new study at the University of California at Los Angeles found that just one week of frequent Web browsing can fire up your brain's complex-reasoning hubs. ""Time online may improve your ability to make decisions,"" says study coauthor and psychiatrist Gary Small, M.D. It's possible that the more we surf, the more efficient our brains can become at strategizing, he explains. ""It's like going to the gym. After a while, you can lift more weight with less effort."" But scientists aren't giving i-geeks free license to click around all day and night. Take regular breaks and, adds Small, be sure to socialize with actual humans.</p><p><strong>Chewing gum can keep you trim.</strong><br />We hate to burst the bubble of etiquette watchers, but recent research shows that chomping on gum-ever so politely, of course-can improve both short-and longterm memory (scientists are still figuring out exactly why). And chewing the stuff might also help you slim down, according to new research from the University of Rhode Island. Animal research suggests that frequent chewing can stimulate the brain's satiety center, which is responsible for making us feel full, says lead study author Kathleen Melanson, Ph.D., R.D. (Bonus: Her subjects also had higher energy levels.) Go with a stick of the sugar-free kind.</p>",

Our plan is grounded in two principles that have been proven to maximize muscle memory.<br /><br /><b>Constant Challenge:</b> The Muscle Memory Workout delivers a new challenge every time you lift. The workout uses ""daily undulating periodization""-a fancy way of saying you do high reps using light weights, moderate reps with medium weights, and few reps of lifting heavy weights throughout the week, so your routine never gets stale. Exercisers who followed this kind of plan gained twice as much upper-and lower-body strength after 12 weeks as those who followed a traditional plan, according to Arizona State University researchers. In other words, they generated that many more nuclei, forged new pathways, and banked more muscle memory in the same amount of time. <p></p><p><b>Variety:</b> ""The more exercises you perform, the more motor units you will recruit, which will activate and build more muscle fibers and reduce the amount of atrophy (muscle deterioration and loss) that comes with aging and inactivity,"" says Adam Knight, Ph.D. The unique moves in this workout challenge your muscles in novel ways, along with honing your balance, which is essential for keeping proprioceptors sharp.</p><p>Though the plan focuses on strength, don't neglect your cardio. Heart-pumping activities such as running, swimming, and biking create healthy adaptations in your cardiovascular, hormone, and immune systems that you retain for life. Variety is key here too, so change it up frequently. The more pathways you establish, the more active you'll be when you're old and gray. Think of it as contributing to a 401(k) for your health. </p><p><b>How the Program Works</b><br />Do the following eight moves on three nonconsecutive days a week, using the chart below as a guide. Don't let ""light"" days fool you. ""Even on light days, you should feel as if you can't do another rep after the final one,"" says Douglas Lentz, director of fitness and wellness for Summit Health in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.<br /><br /><b>Day 1:</b> Light<br />2 sets, 10 to 12 reps<br />Weight: 5 to 10<br /><br /><b>Day 2:</b> Medium<br />3 sets, 8 to 10 reps<br />Weight: 10 to 15<br /><br /><b>Day 3:</b> Heavy<br />4 sets, 4 to 6 reps<br />Weight: 15 to 20</p><p><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/fit-for-life"">More on muscle memory and why it's important.</a></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Exercise   <br /><br />Boat with a Twist<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1012-boat-with-twist.jpg"" /><br /><br /><b>Benefit:</b> Hones neuromuscular pathways in your core by forcing you to stabilize yourself and perform a controlled motion. <br /><br />Sit with knees bent and hold a dumbbell by the ends in front of your chest, elbows pointed out.

Between 10 and 30 percent of the calories you use each day get burned by the simple act of digesting your food. Now that's pretty cool-satisfying your <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-and-food-cravings"">food cravings</a> actually fries calories! But not all foods are created equal. Your body uses more calories to digest protein (about 25 burned for every 100 consumed) than it does to digest fats and carbohydrates (10 to 15 burned for every 100 consumed).<br /><br />That's why the Abs Diet concentrates on adding lean, healthy proteins. Eat more of them, in a sensible way, and you'll torch more calories. Protein is also the nutrient that builds muscle-and the more muscle you have, the higher your metabolism and the more calories you'll burn throughout the day. When you lift and lower weights, you create microscopic tears in your muscles. To mend the tears, your body parachutes in new protein to assess the damage and repair the muscle. Proteins fortify the original cell structure by building new muscle fibers.<br /><br />This wonder child of the nutrition world also makes you feel fuller faster. But the good news doesn't stop there. Following an eating plan that emphasizes lean proteins will accelerate weight loss from your midsection first. <br /><br />We're so used to hearing people talk about eating less food that it's become weight-loss doctrine. But as you remember from the physiology of metabolism, you have to eat more often in order to change your body composition.<br /><br /><b>Let the belly flattening begin!</b><br /><br /><b>1. Guideline - Eat six times a day.</b><br /><br />Key concept: ""energy balance""-that is, how many calories you're burning versus how many you're taking in. Researchers at Georgia State University found that if you keep your hourly surplus or deficit within 300 to 500 calories at all times, you will best be able to lose fat and add lean muscle mass. If you eat only three squares a day, you're creating energy imbalances: Between meals, you're burning more calories than you're taking in; at mealtimes, you're consuming more than you're burning. So alternate larger meals with smaller snacks and eat every 2 to 3 hours. It will keep you full and satisfied, which reduces the likelihood of a diet-destroying binge.<br /><br /><b>2. Guideline - Make these <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/abs-diet-quickstart-meal-plan"">12 Powerfoods</a> your diet staples, as well as these <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/foods-that-burn-fat"">foods that burn fat</a>.</b><br /><br /><b>3. Guideline - Drink smoothies on a regular basis.</b><br /><br />Smoothies--blended mixtures of milk, low-fat yogurt, whey protein powder, ice, and other good stuff from the Powerfoods list -- can act as meal substitutes and potent snacks. They require little time; berries, flavored whey powder, or peanut butter will satisfy your sweet tooth; and their thickness takes up space in your stomach. So get a blender and whip up an 8-ounce <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.absdietforwomen.com/nc2?keycode=142687"">smoothie for breakfast</a> or have one before or after your workout.<br /><br /><b>4. Guideline - <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/booze-and-calorie-guidelines"">Stop counting</a>.</b><br /><br />By eating the 12 Powerfoods and their many relatives, the foods themselves will, in a way, count your calories for you. They'll keep you <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.absdietforwomen.com/nc2?keycode=142687"">healthy and satisfied</a>. Plus, the most energy-efficient foods are almost like bouncers at a nightclub: They're not going to let any of the riffraff in without your approval. That said, it's always wise -- especially in the beginning, when you're most vulnerable and adjusting to a new way of eating -- to focus on portion control by limiting the servings of some foods, particularly the ones with fat (like peanut butter) and carbohydrates (like rice or bread). A good rule: Stick to one or two servings per food group and confine the total contents of each meal to the diameter of your plate.<br /><br /><b>5. Guideline - Know what to drink -- <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/booze-and-calorie-guidelines"">and what not to</a>.</b><br /><br />There are many ways that alcohol can get you into trouble. It doesn't make you feel full or decrease the amount of food you consume. In fact, alcohol encourages your body to burn up to 36 percent less fat and makes you store more of the fat you eat. And it can inhibit your body's production of hormones that help burn fat and build muscle. If you can't pass up your pinot, limit yourself to two or three alcoholic drinks a week. Water may not be as exciting as 'Weiser, but drinking about eight glasses of the clear stuff a day has a lot of benefits. It helps keep you satiated (often what we interpret as hunger is ?really thirst). It flushes the waste products your body makes when it breaks down fat for energy or when it processes protein. And it transports nutrients to your muscles to keep your metabolism clicking. Otherwise, the best drinks you can have are low-fat milk and green tea (or, if you must, two glasses of diet soda a day).<br /><br /><b>6. Guideline - For one meal a week, forget the first five guidelines.</b><br /><br />We would never advocate cheating on your spouse or your taxes. But we want you to cheat on this <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.absdietforwomen.com/nc2?keycode=142687"">diet</a>. Take one meal during the week and forget everything about good carbohydrates and good fats. Have half a pizza, a Kit Kat, Alfredo sauce, or whatever it is you miss the most. Think of this cheat meal as the carrot at the end of a good week of eating. Enjoy the gluttony -- and please, don't take ""carrot"" literally.<br /><br /><strong>Extra Credit</strong><br />Turbocharge the six Abs Diet guidelines by establishing these three simple habits of lean and healthy eating.<br /><strong>1. Prepare your own meals.</strong> As your number of home-cooked meals increases, your fast-food visits decrease. By cooking at home using the recipes in the next chapter, you'll automatically avoid huge restaurant portions and calorie overload. USDA scientists found that people eat about 500 calories more a day when they consume food made outside the home.<br /><br /><strong>2. Eliminate added sugars.</strong> ""This is the simplest way to clean up any diet,"" says Jonny Bowden, PhD, the author of The 150 Healthiest Foods on Earth. Avoid putting sugar in anything you eat. And stay away from soda, baked goods, fruit drinks, and sugary breakfast cereals. USDA researchers say 82 percent of our added sugar can be attributed to those foods.<br /><br /><strong>3. Don't fear fat.</strong> Fats found in meat, dairy, avocados, olive oil, and nuts are filling and add flavor to meals, which will help you avoid feeling deprived, says nutritionist Alan Aragon, MS. For a rule of thumb, shoot for half a gram of fat for every pound of your desired body weight.<br /><br />","lose weight,Getting Started,Eating Strategies"

But experts say more and more women are falling short on shut-eye, and staring at the ceiling all night isn't just frustrating--it can also be life threatening. Studies show that one in six fatal car accidents are caused by sleep-deprived drivers, and according to the National Sleep Foundation (NSF), the 40 million Americans who now suffer from sleep disorders are at higher risk for a slew of serious health issues. Here, what's behind the insomnia epidemic, plus fast-acting solutions for getting quality sleep.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Vitamin Z Deficiency</b><br /><br />A growing number of nocturnal ailments are robbing women of critical slumber. To date, there are about 90 official sleep disorders, the three most common being insomnia, restless leg syndrome, and <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/tips-on-snoring"">sleep apnea</a>, a potentially life-threatening disorder in which people stop breathing during sleep, says Philip Westbrook, M.D., former president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.<br /><br /></p><p></p><p>New research has shed light on why sleep problems are skyrocketing. As with many health issues, stress is to blame. ""Thanks to the economy, there's been a big increase in stress, especially in women,"" says Alan Lankford, Ph.D., president and CEO of the Sleep Disorders Center of Georgia. ""And stress can have a huge impact on falling and staying asleep."" When you're mentally keyed up at night, your body pumps out the stress hormone cortisol, which acts like an adrenaline shot that prevents snoozing.<br /><br /><br /><br />Also contributing to sleepless nights is a genuinely modern double threat: overactive minds and underactive bodies. Thanks to our coffee culture, people tend to suck down jolts of energy well into the afternoon. ""Any kind of caffeine, even the small amounts in hot chocolate and candy bars, can impair your sleep if ingested after 2 p.m.,"" says James Maas, Ph.D., coauthor of Sleep for Success! Everything You Must Know About Sleep but Are Too Tired to Ask.<br /><br /><br /><br />Artificial blue light from a television or computer is another powerful mental stimulant that blocks production of the sleep hormone melatonin. So fiddling with your iPad or watching Conan within an hour of bedtime signals your brain to stay alert--and awake. This might not be such a big deal if we got off our butts more often. ""Women evolved to be physically active from morning to night,"" says Westbrook.<br /><br /><br /><br />""But today's desk-bound woman, even one who regularly hits the gym, still doesn't get the exercise her body was built for, and ample exercise is crucial for good sleep.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>A Wake-Up Call for Your Health</b><br /><br />A solid third of your life should be spent in slumber, and not just so you can recover from those happy hours gone wild. Sleep is critical for overall health, says Maas, ""and people are starting to realize it's a necessity, not a luxury."" As you snooze, your body repairs errant cells, builds bone and muscle, consolidates memories, and stores up energy for the days, weeks, and years ahead. Sleep is so important, in fact, that some doctors consider how much you get to be a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/health-warning-signs"">vital sign of overall health</a>, on par with body temperature and blood pressure, says Lankford.<br /><br /><br /><br />When you're spent, your healthy habits tend to disappear. Fatigue makes the body crave a quick hit of energy--otherwise known as a high-calorie carb-fest. (Ever hit a fast-food drive-through after a rough night?) Going to the gym, a smarter pick-me- up, can seem about as doable as taking a trip to Mars, which is why nearly 50 percent of women report skipping exercise when they're beat, according to the NSF.<br /><br /><br /><br />Habitually skimping on shut-eye can also lead to chronic health problems or worsen preexisting ailments. ""Sleep deprivation is cumulative,"" says Lankford.<br /><br /><br /><br />""If someone needs eight hours a night and gets only six every night for a week, by Friday she will be functioning on sleep debt."" Long term, that can spell malfunctioning hormones that pave the way for increased risks of depression, heart problems, gastrointestinal issues, type 2 diabetes, and breast and colorectal cancers. (Breast cancer, for example, has been linked to high levels of estrogen and low levels of melatonin; production of both of these hormones is affected when you're sleep deprived.)<br /><br /></p><p></p><p><b>Hitting the Bottle</b></p><p>Tossing and turning night after night can make a person desperate enough to storm her doc's office. But instead of searching for the root causes of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/tips-for-more-energy"">insomnia</a>, many physicians simply whip out their prescription pads. ""Until recently, many doctors were not trained in sleep treatment in med school,"" says Maas. ""Of the 90 or so sleep disorders, most physicians can name around four. Many hand over pills because they don't know how else to solve the problem."" To wit, a whopping 60 million sleep prescriptions were filled in 2009, according to research firm IMS Health.<br /><br /><br /><br />All this pill popping has ushered in a new set of problems. For one thing, some sleep drugs are addictive, especially older ones such as benzodiazepines. Even the new class of nonbenzos can be habit forming, says sleep doctor Shelby Freedman Harris, Psy.D., director of behavioral sleep medicine at Montefiore Medical Center's Sleep-Wake Disorders Center in New York City. ""Though people are not hooked on them physiologically, they can develop a psychological dependence and think they'll never sleep if they don't take a pill,"" she says. Rare but scary side effects include things like memory loss and sleepwalking, sleep driving, or sleep sex. Plus, says Westbrook, no studies show what extended use of these drugs does to your body.<br /><br /><br /><br />""The bottom line is that prescription sleeping pills are a short-term solution,"" says Maas. Simply put, drugs may be a godsend for temporary insomnia, but continuous use could be dangerous.<br /><br /><br /><br />""Taking a pill won't get to the underlying issue,"" says Westbrook. Most frightening of all, ""insomnia can be a symptom of depression, and depressed patients who take sleeping pills have an increased risk of suicide."" Likewise, sleep apnea, when treated with Rx sleep meds, can turn fatal.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Put Sleep Issues to Rest</b><br /><br />A safer and more effective cure for sleep problems lies in improving what doctors call <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/sleep-encyclopedia"">sleep hygiene</a>, a combination of natural snooze-inducing practices. Clean up your slumber routine with these tricks:<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Stick to a regular schedule.</i> ""Routine is so important,"" says Maas. ""You have one biological clock--not one for the workweek and one for the weekend. You need to synchronize it and go to sleep around the same time every day."" Changing up your snooze schedule confuses your brain's sleep center and promotes restless nights.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Keep things cool.</i> When you nod off, your core body temperature drops by about a degree and a half, says Lankford. Encourage the process by setting your bedroom thermostat to around 68°F. If you still feel hot at night, you could be smothering yourself under a comforter that's too warm, so switch to a lighter one. Another trick: Take a hot bath before bed. As your body cools, it transitions more easily into sleep mode once you lie down.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Don't be afraid of the dark.</i> Artificial light messes with your internal clock and acts as a stimulant, inhibiting the flow of melatonin. ""An hour before bed, turn off your iPad or computer, and don't text or watch TV,"" says Harris. And by all means, stop watching the clock! Not only do digital versions give off a melatonin-disrupting glow, but watching 20 minutes tick by can lead to more hours of sleepless anxiety.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Exercise earlier.</i> Working out soothes insomnia-fueling stress and eventually lowers your body's built-in thermostat, a necessary presleep step, explains Robert Oexman, D.C., director of the Sleep to Live Institute in Joplin, Missouri. Just finish off your cardio at least four hours before bed--any later and your body temp will still be too high, keeping you awake.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Try some pillow talk.</i> If adopting the sleep-hygiene guidelines above doesn't leave you well rested, you may want to look into cognitive behavioral therapy, in which you learn to challenge, then change, your negative sleep-related thoughts, says Harris. Acupuncture, massage, meditation, or simply taking a series of slow, deep breaths before bed may also help soothe you into sleep. If your insomnia sticks around for more than three weeks, seek out a doctor who is trained in sleep medicine.<br /><br /></p><p></p><p><b>Less Sleep, More Pounds</b></p><p>The reason you can't lose weight may lie between the sheets.<br /><br /><br /><br />The less you sleep, the more of the appetite-revving chemical ghrelin your body makes, and the lower your output of leptin, the hormone that signals you're full, says Lee A. Surkin, M.D. This weight-gain double whammy leaves you craving fatty, salty, carb-filled foods, making it practically impossible to pass up that high-calorie breakfast sandwich.<br /><br /><br /><br />Plenty of women get up before dawn to slip in a workout. But if they aren't going to bed early enough, their weight-loss efforts may be in vain. A study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that sleep-deprived people on low-cal diets lost 55 percent less body fat than those who were well rested. What they did shed, sadly, was lean muscle mass.<br /><br /><br /><br />Preliminary studies show that nighttime exposure to light-- e.g., the kind your computer, cell phone, or TV emits--may lead to obesity. Melatonin, your body's sleep-inducing hormone, is extra-sensitive to any kind of glow. Even barely there lights can disrupt melatonin production, leaving you wide awake and more likely to raid your secret candy stash.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Stages of Sleep</b><br /><br />Stage 1 straddles the line between alert and asleep.<br /><br /><br /><br />Stage 2 is when your body temp cools and you're oblivious to your surroundings.<br /><br /><br /><br />Stages 3 and 4 send you into deeper levels of sleep. Your breathing slows, your blood pressure drops, and your muscles relax.<br /><br /><br /><br />You then move into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep for anywhere from five to 40 minutes at a time. ""In REM sleep, the brain is awake but you're unaware of your surroundings, unconscious in one sense but totally conscious in another,"" explains Philip Westbrook, M.D. The stage occurs every 90 minutes throughout the night, and it's during REM that you have your most vivid dreams.<br /><br /><br /><br />Once you've snoozed your way through each level, you typically go from REM right back into stage two. It all tapers off in the a.m., when your body releases cortisol to help you shrug off sleepiness as you open your eyes.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>What Your Sleep Style Says About You (And Your Health)</b><br /><br /><i>Stomach</i></p><p>If you prefer a prone position (lying nearly facedown), you're likely a perfectionist who is compulsive, persistent, and goal oriented, says psychiatrist Samuel Dunkell, M.D., a sleep expert in New York City. These qualities may be good for your career, but they don't do your body any favors. Sleeping on your stomach can twist your neck into an awkward position, put excess pressure on your spine, and make it more difficult to inhale, says Lee A. Surkin, M.D. To avoid waking up all achy, gently nudge yourself into sleeping in a fetal pose by lying on your side with one pillow between your knees and another behind your back.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Back</i><br /><br />Staring straight up at the ceiling can signal an adventurous, confident, and receptive personality, says Dunkell. Catching Z's on your back also keeps pressure off your jaw, which is crucial for people with painful temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder. But back sleeping triggers undue stress on your airway, so it's a bad idea for snorers. If you're a noisy breather, try the pillow trick explained above or buy a full-body pillow that will keep you on your side.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Side</i><br /><br />Some 73 percent of women and 50 percent of men spend the night on their sides. Most curl into a semi-fetal pose, with their knees just slightly bent, says Dunkell. According to his research, such people tend to be compromising and appeasing, whereas those who snooze in full fetal (with their knees practically hugged to their chest) are introspective and intense. Healthwise, sleeping on either side curtails snoring, and resting on your left side keeps your stomach active and eases heartburn, according to the <i>Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology.</i><br /></p>",

Like dairy, it contains the amino acid leucine, which may play a role in preserving muscle mass during weight loss, keeping metabolism running at full speed. Protein is also more satiating than fat or carbs-so you're less likely to overeat. </p><p><strong>Peanuts</strong><br />Ironically, this elephant favorite fights weight gain, slows rises in blood sugar, and curbs hunger. One study from Purdue University found that individuals who added 500 calories of peanuts to their diets for 3 weeks experienced almost no change in body weight and a 24 percent drop in triglycerides -- blood fats associated with heart disease. Researcher Rick Mattes, Ph.D., says peanuts' satiating power helps people eat less overall. </p><p><strong>Low-Fat Yogurt</strong><br />Plain, low-fat yogurt is one of the best sources of <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/get-stronger-bones"">calcium</a>-a mineral that may fight fat. According to Michael B. Zemel, Ph.D., director of the Nutrition Institute at the of Tennessee, not getting enough calcium triggers the release of calcitriol, a hormone that causes us to store fat, whereas meeting our daily calcium needs helps us burn fat more efficiently. Like turkey, yogurt and other dairy foods are leading sources of leucine, which also helps fight fat. </p><p><strong>Breakfast Cereal</strong><br />By boosting fiber and providing fewer calories from fat than other popular breakfasts (bacon and eggs, anyone?), ready-to-eat cereal can help you fill up-and slim down. Study from the <i>Journal of the American Dietetic Association</i> found that women who ate cereal were 30 percent less likely to be overweight than those who ate other breakfast foods. To get the most bang for your breakfast buck, choose fiber-rich (aim for 5 grams per serving), low-fat cereals like Kashi Heart to Heart. For more top brefast cereals, see <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/the-healthiest-breakfast-cereals""><i>WH</i>'s Guide to the Healthiest Cereals.</a></p><p><strong>Enova Oil</strong><br />Enova - made from soy and canola oils - is made of diglycerides, a type of fat that's metabolized differently from triglycerides (found in other oils-even olive) and so not stored as fat as easily. In a study in the <i>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</i>, dieters who used Enova lost more weight than those who used other oils. </p><p><strong>Berries</strong><br />You probably know that fiber is the magic bullet of weight loss.

The goal: to determine which vegetable is No. 1 in nutrition, and which should take first place when you're eating your food. Of course, all veggies are winners when it comes to warding off excess weight and preventing disease; but with all the peeling and chopping you have to do to get them to the table, they're not the easiest foods around (no wonder most women fail to score five servings a day).

Here's how to keep your body a top priority, no matter which of these fitness-derailing transitions life throws your way.</p><p><strong>Injury</strong><br />A pulled hamstring or torn rotator cuff can send you to the couch for weeks-even months.<br /><strong>Set a goal.</strong> First, ask your doctor how long you'll be sidelined. To avoid workout withdrawal, find out what else you can do to stay in shape and set a doable goal to achieve by the time you're all healed up. Let's say swimming gets a green light. Aim to swim the equivalent of half a mile (that's about 32 lengths of a 25-meter pool). ""A goal helps you let go of your immediate disappointment and look beyond the injury,"" says Edmund Acevedo, Ph.D., chairman of the health and human performance department at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p><p><strong>Promotion</strong><br />Moving up to a better position has certain perks, but spare time is usually not one of them. <br /><strong>Identify the workplace athlete.</strong> ""You're more likely to maintain a fitness routine if the responsibility doesn't rest entirely on you,"" says Edward Etzel, Ed.D., a sport psychologist at West Virginia University. Approach the lunch-hour runner or the after-work gym fiend and find out how she makes it work. Does she keep gym clothes in her desk? Does she do short-but-intense workouts so she's finished in an hour? Adopt aspects of her routine and you'll soon have one of your own. </p><p><strong>New Baby</strong><br />Yeah, the bambino is a blessing, but the extra pounds can feel more like a curse. <br /><strong>Add gym time to your to-do list.</strong> Even if it's nowhere near the grand scale of your pre-baby regimen, check with your doctor and then make some form of exercise part of your regular schedule, alongside feedings and naps. Make yourself the priority a couple times a week. But this may be the one time you can cut yourself a little workout slack. ""Women can become obsessed with dropping the baby weight and get frustrated if it doesn't happen right away,"" says celebrity trainer Gunnar Peterson, who got Jennifer Lopez back into shape after the birth of her twins. ""All that does is add stress, and we all know that doesn't help you get the body you want."" And yes, until you're ready to do more, walking around the house toting a 10-pound bundle of cuteness counts. </p><p><strong>Big Move</strong><br />Between hunting for new digs and packing up your life, your running shoes may get buried in the boxes.<br /><strong>Scope out your fitness options before you pack the moving va</strong>n. If you join the local gym or ID new running routes prior to your move, you'll have a workout at the ready once your stuff is unpacked. ""You'll create a subconscious commitment to exercise regardless of geography,"" says Chris Carr, Ph.D., a sport and performance psychologist at St. Vincent Sports Performance in Indianapolis.</p><p> </p>",best tips ever

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/cell-phone-radiation,Health,140,208,154,6,2,7,1,0,,Health Risks of Mobile Devices,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1011-phone-health-risks.jpg,"<p>Unless you've had your cell phone permanently glued to your ear, chances are you've heard the recent health buzz: Mobile devices may cause cancer. While it's true that the National Cancer Institute has ruled them safe, a growing number of independent researchers and the nation's <a href=""/health/top-doctors-for-women"">best doctors</a> disagree.<br /><br /><br /><br />Those experts point out that the FCC wireless regulations on cell phone safety are largely based on something called specific absorption rate (SAR) levels, or the rate at which our bodies absorb radiation. Most phones <i>do</i> comply with the federal standards, but SAR monitors only thermal effects. (In other words, if the radiation from your phone isn't cooking your brain, it's regarded as safe.) But mounting scientific evidence suggests that <i>nonthermal</i> radio frequency radiation (RF)-the invisible energy waves that connect cell phones to cell towers, and power numerous other everyday items-can damage our immune systems and alter our cellular makeup, even at intensities considered safe by the FCC.<br /><br /><br /><br />""The problem is that RF can transfer energy waves into your body and disrupt its normal functioning,"" explains Cindy Sage, an environmental consultant in Santa Barbara, California, who has studied radiation for 28 years. ""Here's why that's crucial: Overwhelming evidence shows that RF can cause DNA damage, and DNA damage is a necessary precursor to cancer.""<br /><br /><br /><br />The 2010 Interphone study, the largest to date on RF exposure from mobile phones, has spawned a quagmire of controversy, says health researcher and medical writer Kerry Crofton, Ph.D., who spent four years reviewing RF science for her book <i>Wireless Radiation Rescue: Safeguarding Your Family from the Risks of Electro-Pollution</i>. Many groups, including the National Cancer Institute and the telecom industry, read the results of that study as a green light for wireless calling. Others, like Crofton, point out that because it was largely based on lower cellphone usage in the '90s, the research has little bearing on today's world, in which 285 million Americans have mobile phones and 83 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds are ""wired"" all the time and sleep with their cell phones next to their heads.<br /><br /><br /><br />One thing the Interphone study did find? People who chatted via cell for just 30 minutes a day for 10 years saw their risk of glioma (the type of brain tumor that killed Ted Kennedy) rise 40 percent. As a result, many European countries are considering banning cell phones for children under age 6 (RF penetrates little kids' brains more easily), and France has already banned all wireless technology in some schools and many public places, notes physician and epidemiologist Samuel Milham, M.D., a leader in the growing field of electromagnetic research.<br /><br /><br /><br />All parties agree on this: More studies need to be done. In the meantime, it's best to take easy precautions-and not just with mobile phones. ""Never before in human history have we gone from one radiated environment to another,"" says Crofton. ""We're going to wireless offices and living in wireless homes. Even beaches and parks are going wireless. We're exposed everywhere.""<br /><br /><br /><br />The good news is that you don't need to ditch your gadgets. This advice will let you stay plugged in-and keep you healthy.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Cell Phones</b><br /><br /><br />When your phone is on (which it probably is even as you read this) it's constantly sending and receiving RF signals to and from the nearest cell tower to keep you in service. The farther you are from a tower, the harder your phone has to work and the more RF it emits, explains David Carpenter, M.D., director of the Institute for Health and Environment at the University at Albany. The activity really amps up when you're, say, driving through rural areas. Plus, within the close confines of a car, your entire core is exposed to the radiation.<br /><br /><br /><br />The safer solution: Keep your phone off when driving until you really need it, says Carpenter. And no matter where you are, avoid holding a cell phone directly to your noggin (the Interphone study showed gliomas were more prevalent on the side of the head people continuously pressed phones to), always keep it at least six inches or more from your body (in your purse, not your pocket), and use either speakerphone or a corded headset (not a wireless headset). Or text up a storm. If you have a smartphone that's loaded with games, music, and movies, turn your wireless settings off while playing or rocking out. Similarly, don't ever use your cell phone as a bedside alarm clock without first disabling the wireless mode.<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Cordless Phones</b><br /><br /><br />These stealth wireless threats ""have become so powerful, they're often as strong as cell phones,"" says Sage. ""The phone base is like a mini cell tower. It radiates 24-7 and can have a range of up to 300 feet."" Particularly suspect are digital enhanced cordless telecommunication (DECT) phones. Preliminary blind studies have found that, when sitting beside a DECT phone base, some people experienced arrhythmia, a troubling heartbeat irregularity that could eventually lead to stroke or coronary disease, says Sage.<br /><br /><br /><br />The safer solution: You might feel somewhat retro, but ""just get a corded phone with an extra-long cord so you can still walk around,"" says Crofton. ""They're better, they're cheaper, and they work in a power outage. Every time you replace a DECT with a corded phone, you're cutting the RF levels in your home significantly.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Wireless Routers</b><br /><br /><br />Your neighborhood coffee shop's wireless Internet access may often seem like a godsend, but the router that's needed to provide the service is continuously emitting high levels of RF (up to 200 feet out), and that constant exposure has been linked to deadly diseases. ""If the whole body is radiated by a router's RF emissions, the greatest concern is cancer, especially leukemia,"" says Carpenter. Also, be aware of your at-home router and any plug-in wireless USB cards you often use.<br /><br /><br /><br />The safer solution: Ditch your wireless router and plug your computer directly into a cable modem, says Sage. That Ethernet technology doesn't leak RF and is often faster and more secure. If you just can't give up your wireless router (e.g., if you live in a home with a handful of computer users), make sure you sit as far away from it as possible, says Crofton, and turn it off at night and whenever you're not online. Another easy fix: Plug your router into a surge protector with a timer, and set it to go off each night so you don't have to remember to flip the switch.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Laptops</b><br /><br /><br />""When you hold your laptop on your lap, what you're essentially doing is radiating your pelvis,"" says Carpenter, ""so all the cancers that affect that area are of concern."" Indeed, early studies point to a heightened risk of testicular cancer for men who keep RF-emitting devices close to their belts. For women, adds Carpenter, ""the studies aren't quite there yet, but I think we can say that anything that might cause cancer almost always causes birth defects, so pregnant women-or those wanting to become pregnant soon-should take extra precautions.""<br /><br /><br /><br />The safer solution: Keep your laptop off your lap (if you have to rest it there, buffer it with a sturdy pillow that's at least six inches thick). Try to use a desktop computer at home and treat your laptop as an on-the-go convenience. One thing to keep in mind: Laptops are a high RF radiation risk only while connected to wireless Internet, so when you're watching a DVD, fiddling around with your photos, or writing that dissertation, just disable your connection and you'll be much safer.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Baby Monitors</b><br /><br /><br />""Baby monitors release more RF than cell phones do, and putting them next to a crib is very, very unwise,"" says Carpenter. He points to a recent University of Utah study that shows RF radiation can penetrate almost entirely through a child's brain, which doesn't form completely until nearly 20 years of age. ""It's very clear from all the existing research that the younger the child is, the more vulnerable he or she is to the effects of RF radiation.""<br /><br /><br /><br />The safer solution: Consider not using a baby monitor. If you absolutely must use one, place it far from your baby's crib-at least 10 to 15 feet away.<br /><br /></p>",Decode Him

I'd get to be creative, meet talented sitcom writers, and best of all, work for a woman I idolized. Amanda,* a TV veteran who worked on some great shows, seemed intimidating from afar-drop-dead gorgeous and extremely successful-but in our interview, she was warm and funny, listened carefully to my ideas, and complimented me on everything from my intellect to my earrings. I showed up my first day thinking, ""This will be the Best. Job. Ever.""</p><p>Instead, I drove home every night in tears. Amanda stole my ideas, sabotaged my relationships with writers, and ""forgot"" to tell me about meetings. It was like high school all over again. How could this be happening in a respected company run by professionals?</p><p>Apparently, it happens a lot. According to a nationwide poll by the Employment Law Alliance, 45 percent of American workers say they've experienced <a target=""_self"" href=""/life/dealing-with-work-drama"">workplace abuse</a>. But oddly enough, while men are equal-opportunity bullies, pushing around both male and female coworkers, the 40 percent of tormentors who are women tend to pick on other women more than 70 percent of the time. So much for female bonding.</p><p><b>What Sisterhood? </b><br />One reason women may take on other women: ""They're often less confrontational when attacked,"" says Gary Namie, Ph.D., cofounder of the Workplace Bullying Institute, an advocacy group. ""They tend to turn their backs on bad behavior in a way men might not.""</p><p>So how do you know whether you're being bullied or simply dealing with a difficult boss or <a target=""_self"" href=""/life/decode-your-office-peers"">coworker</a>? The clearest sign: Bullying is something that happens again and again. ""It's not just your boss having a bad day every now and then,"" Namie says. The <a href=""/life/workplace-sexual-harassment"">harassment</a> can include yelling; intimidating or humiliating behavior, like angry criticism and personal insults; or sabotage, whether it's vicious gossip or taking credit for someone else's work.</p><p>Pretty nasty stuff-and the stress of the recession hasn't helped. In a survey from the Workplace Bullying Institute earlier this year, 27 percent of respondents said their offices had become more abusive over the previous nine months, partly because of the pressure of the times. And when people are stressed, they're more likely to act out. Talk about a perfect storm for bad behavior.</p><p>Elizabeth, 27, found herself in the eye of one of those storms during her first job as a publishing assistant in New York City. Her perfectionist boss was known for making cutting remarks, zeroing in on people's weaknesses, and reducing staffers to tears. ""Every week I did a long report for her, and I made a small mistake on one,"" Elizabeth recalls. ""The next day, she slammed the files down and yelled in front of everyone, 'F---ing fix this!'""</p><p>Then there are the bosses who stay cool as ice but are just plain sadistic. Molly, a 43-year-old Internet marketing specialist in Los Angeles, once asked her boss for time off because her father was having emergency surgery across the country; her boss accused her of trying to take a vacation and wouldn't let her go.</p><p><b>Covert Tactics</b><br />Generally, though, women aren't openly abusive: In fact, there's evidence that their style of bullying is subtler than men's. ""Women are better at reading emotions,"" says Robert Sutton, a professor of management science at Stanford University. ""So they're good at little digs that most men wouldn't even register- the quick glare, or turning away and talking to someone else."" </p><p>Anyone tortured by a <a href=""/life/abusive-bosses"">Mean Girl</a> in adolescence knows that these tactics can get personal. Molly says that her boss insulted her hair (""She said it was too curly and, at a meeting, asked the whole group to chip in for me to get a proper haircut"") and each morning said hello to everyone in the office but her.</p><p>It's these pointed digs that make some female bullies more toxic than the classic rageaholic. ""A man might give you an unreasonable work load and then yell at you for not completing it. Mean women take advantage of vulnerabilities,"" Namie says. ""They'll backstab, undermine, and exclude to hurt other women.""</p><p><b>Knock It Off!</b><br />Many bullies survive because they're valuable to the business in some way, says Joy Chen, founder of Chen Partners, a California executive search firm. ""They're destructive,"" she says, ""but they're destructive achievers."" Not addressing a bullying problem, however, does have a cost: A <i>Harvard Business Review</i> study found that picked-on employees reported a decrease in their work quality and commitment to their organization. </p><p>Some companies do take their meanies aside. Terry, 35, who headed a marketing team, was required to take a leadership course after her boss called her in and said that she'd received complaints. ""She told me I was harsh and condescending and had too-high expectations,"" Terry says. The course taught her how to deal with different personality types, and she never got a negative performance review again.</p><p>So what options does a bullied employee have? ""The biggest mistake that a target makes is thinking they can outlast the bully,"" Namie says. ""That rarely happens."" So you've got to dig in your heels and get proactive.</p><p>Lynn Taylor, author of <i>Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant</i>, believes that dealing with a bully isn't so different from dealing with a toddler having a tantrum: You have to be the calm adult. If a bully is shouting at you, let her vent until she tires out. Don't interrupt or roll your eyes, and definitely don't cry. Look her straight in the eye and listen.</p><p>When the storm has passed, repeat her concerns back to her, and be specific about how to fix things, Taylor says. ""Distill the emotional garbage down to the work product. She's expecting you to be defensive or to break down, but instead, you're on her team and drawing her into the solution.""</p><p>If the problem is a sneaky or vicious coworker, take her aside-she gets a lot of her confidence from having an audience-and in a quiet, steady voice, let her know that one, you are so on to her, and two, it had better stop. Now. Don't give her a chance to explain; say your piece, then walk away.</p><p>If these strategies don't work, talk to HR-but your case will be stronger if the bullying behavior has been well documented. So save angry e-mails and keep detailed notes of each incident, says Peggy Krynicki, a human resources officer at the Annenberg Foundation, a private philanthropic organization in Los Angeles. By law, HR has to fully investigate all claims, even though most bullying isn't illegal.</p><p>In some cases, a warning will stop the behavior; in others, HR can help the two sides communicate. But consider that taking this route could strain the relationship further. ""You have to decide whether going to HR will give you the return you need to deal with the bully,"" Krynicki says. ""If it doesn't, you may end up having to leave.""</p><p>Before it gets to that point, it's worth trying to stand your ground and dodge the storm. And keep in mind that life has a funny way of working out: When you're dealing with a bitch, remember that karma, as they say, is a bitch as well. In the end, the universe might just kick your bully to the curb.</p><p>*<i>All names have been changed.<br /></i></p>",

This doesn't mean you'll start obsessing over fantasy football, but your map-reading skills may peak along with your period.</p><p><strong>There's no need to bleed.</strong><br />While some women think extended-cycle birth-control pills (the ones that put your period on hiatus) are the greatest things since chocolate-covered pretzels, others worry about tweaking Mother Nature. Relax, says Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., clinical professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale University School of Medicine: ""Your uterus won't explode if you don't have a period."" Extended-cycle pills give you 28 days of hormones, rather than 21 plus seven placebo pills, so there's no hormonal vacay week of bleeding. In fact, you can benefit from taking any kind of birth-control pills. Studies show they decrease your risk of <a href=""/health/conditions/ovarian-cancer"">ovarian cancer</a> by about 50 percent.</p><p></p><p><br /><strong>Stress can make a period more-or less-frequent. </strong><br />Not only can stress wreck your sleep-it can also throw a wrench into your cycle, says F. Ralph Dauterive, M.D., chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Ochsner Clinic in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. ""Your brain responds to nerve-racking events by releasing stress hormones that can interfere with those regulating your cycle, setting you up for irregular periods, shorter cycles, or even menses that go MIA for months at a time.""</p><p><strong>It can make you crave sex.</strong><br />Though you may be more inclined to reach for your comfy sweats over lacy lingerie, a lot of women find themselves turned on during menstruation. Since the level of progesterone-the hormone that some experts blame for putting a damper on libido-is at its lowest during your period, you might feel frisky, Minkin says. More good news: Researchers say frequent boot knocking and being exposed to hormones in male armpit sweat (no, you don't have to sniff it) can lead to more regular cycles.</p>",Simplify Your Life
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/boost-smarts,Health,339,191,68,62,0,1,26,0,,Get Smarter Every Day,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/get-smart.jpg,"<p>We all want to be brighter bulbs in the chandelier. But rather than cursing your mom for those martinis she downed while you were cooking in the womb, check out these five ways to improve your brainpower. They're simple, they're fun, and one of them even involves spending QT with your TV.</p><p><strong>Read Between the Lines</strong><br />Pick up a Kafka novel or even a book of modern poetry and you'll be helping your brain work better, according to a recent study in <em>Psychological Science</em>. When you're exposed to something that doesn't automatically make sense, your mind tries to find some other kind of meaning-a response that kicks your gray matter into high gear and enhances the part that's in charge of learning. </p><p>If you prefer whodunnits or historical romances, no need to worry-your mind is getting just as stretched, but in a slightly different way, says Keith Oatley, Ph.D., former director of the cognitive science program at the University of Toronto. ""Fiction in general is a kind of simulation of our emotional and social worlds. People who read lots of fiction tend to be more empathetic and socially intelligent than those who don't."" The bottom line: Read something with substance. ""Even when you peruse the newspaper or a magazine, you're taking in different ideas, creating a bigger database of knowledge in your mind,"" says Daniel Willingham, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia. </p><p><strong>Solve a Small-Screen Mystery</strong><br />Flip to an episode of <em>Lost</em> or <em>CSI</em> to help build your intelligence. TV shows that include elements such as overlapping plot strands, several primary characters, moral ambiguity, and no helpful connect-the-dots narrator actually engage your brain in a data-gathering, hypothesizing, and testing process that mirrors the scientific method, according to Steven Johnson, Ph.D., author of <em>Everything Bad Is Good for You: How Today's Popular Culture Is Actually Making Us Smarter</em>. So while you're trying to figure out why Hugo hasn't lost any weight, or why they never turn on the lab lights on CSI, your noggin is exercising your problem-solving skills and enhancing your social intelligence. </p><p><strong>Conk Out</strong><br />Getting enough shut-eye may help your brain process the day by strengthening memories and the connections between neurons, resulting in better recall, reports a new study from Michigan State University. Participants were asked to identify a list of words shown to them 12 hours earlier, after having either a full night's sleep or no sleep at all. Those who hadn't snoozed made the most mistakes, meaning they were more likely to have incorrect memories. </p><p>These experiments are the first to indicate that false memories (remembering things that didn't happen) can be reduced after sleep and that the benefits of slumber include a more accurate retention of basic info. So getting plenty of rest could mean never having to search for your keys again (or at least not every single morning). </p><p><strong>Tune Up</strong><br />According to a recent study review from the online service Faculty of 1000 Biology and Medicine, practicing a musical instrument connects and develops the motor systems of the brain, refining the entire neurological system in ways that can't be done through any other activity. </p><p>If you're not about to run out and sign yourself up for flute lessons, you can get similar benefits by playing games such as <em>Easy Piano</em> for Nintendo DS, which comes with an external 13-note, full-octave keyboard, or <em>KB Piano</em> for your PC, which lets you play more than 100 different instruments, from guitar to ocarina. ""In some ways, the brain is like a muscle,"" says Richard Haier, Ph.D., a professor of pediatric neurology at the University of California at Irvine. Meaning, the more it's worked-such as by practicing an instrument-the more efficient it becomes. </p><p><strong>Socialize with Smarties</strong><br />Instead of heading straight home to your pj's and a glass of pinot after work, go to happy hour with your pals to do your brain good. ""The mental gymnastics that come with social interaction may provide boosts to our cognitive functioning,"" says Oscar Ybarra, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan. In his research, he found that study participants who were more social had higher levels of cognitive performance, meaning they were better at remembering information that could later be used for planning, setting goals, and reasoning. Take your socializing to the next level by hanging out with people who are brainier than you...even if it means you have to pick up the tab!</p>",

The mystery often lies in figuring out exactly how to trigger a Big O. These bliss-inducing muscle contractions can explode spontaneously during one sexual encounter, but at other times they require a superspecific setting (soft music, dimmed lights), body position (half pike with a twist), and technique (clockwise clitoral stimulation, please!) to set them off. And hitting the height of pleasure is no guarantee.<br /><br />But sex researchers may be getting closer to figuring out the perfect peaking storm. In the past few years, a handful of scientists have started to make some important discoveries about what goes on inside your body and brain before, during, and after an orgasm. And the more you know, the more pleasure you can achieve.<p></p><p>Think about it like this: You can drive a car without grasping how an engine works. But if the car won't start, understanding what's going on under the hood could help you resolve the problem and get on the road faster. The same goes for getting a better handle on your body mechanics. Here's what's happening to your anatomy from arousal to afterglow...and how to use that info to intensify your satisfaction.</p><p><strong>Laying the Groundwork for Liftoff</strong><br />Foreplay, as you might well suspect, is crucial. During all that groping, kissing, and caressing, your nervous system starts taking notes and fires feel-good messages through the web of nerves that weave their way through your pelvis and up to your brain. This early stage is where a lot of women get tripped up because they can't silence the voices in their heads (When was the last time I had a bikini wax? Am I prepared for that 8 a.m. meeting?) long enough to focus on the sensations.<br /><br />To keep your mind from wandering out of the bedroom, Ian Kerner, Ph.D., author of <em>She Comes First</em>, suggests zeroing in on one of your senses: Focus on the smell of his skin, relish the feeling of his hands on your body, concentrate on how he tastes while you're kissing. Debby Herbenick, Ph.D., author of <em>Because It Feels Good</em>, often advises fantasizing. ""It sounds counterintuitive, but studies show that lapsing into a sexual fantasy can help a woman become and stay aroused,"" she says. ""Switching to a sexual mind-set makes you more physically responsive.""</p><p>When you're turned on, your nerves communicate to your brain that it's time to increase blood flow. The result: Your genitals become moist and engorged, and your breasts swell and nipples harden. The more engorged you are, the more sensitive you become to his touch, causing the nerves to fire back to the brain to pump more blood, creating an increasingly pleasurable loop, says Barry Komisaruk, Ph.D., an adjunct psychology professor at Rutgers University and coauthor of <em>Orgasm Answer Guide</em>.</p><p>Here's the catch: Keeping that loop going requires patience-yours and his. While the amount of time it takes to reach peak arousal varies from woman to woman, Kerner says the average female requires 10 to 20 minutes of rhythmic manual or oral pressure. Women often speed up the process before they're properly warmed up because they're worried about taking too long. The truth is, guys get off on pleasing their mates. ""Seeing a woman aroused boosts his testosterone levels, turning him on even more,"" Kerner explains.<br /><br /><strong>Getting in Prime Position</strong><br />So, considering that the most important step on your path to ultimate pleasure may be learning to slow down, make sure you're sufficiently primed before you progress to intercourse. ""When you feel a throbbing sensation in your genitals or an intense pressure building on either side of the vaginal wall, it's time to transition to sex. Get into a position that provides clitoral contact-try the coital alignment technique,"" says Herbenick. Have your guy lie on top of you so that the base of his penis aligns with your clitoris, then push your pelvis up while he resists the pressure and moves his hips in a circular motion. Or try a position where he can touch your clitoris with his fingers, such as from behind or woman on top.<br /><br />Groundbreaking research by Australian urologist Helen O'Connell, Ph.D., found that the clitoris actually extends way back into the pelvis and plays a significant role in both vaginal and G-spot orgasms (the G-spot is an especially nerve-rich spot on the frontal vaginal wall). Her research suggests that every climax is actually a blended orgasm. ""Since all orgasms involve the clitoris, G-spot, and vagina, scientists don't really differentiate between types anymore,"" Herbenick notes.</p><p>When you experience an orgasm, an area of the brain called the paraventricular nucleus spills a wave of oxytocin into your bloodstream. As this neurohormone washes through your pelvic muscles, it causes a series of rhythmic contractions, at intervals of every .08 seconds. Your heart starts pumping extra oxygen to the pulsating parts to keep them humming along for about 20 seconds total.</p><p>These contractions will be even stronger if you do Kegel exercises (flexing the muscles that stop urination). Do 10 reps, holding each rep for 10 seconds, twice a day while you're watching TV or doing just about anything. Many women treat Kegels like taking vitamins: It's something they know they should do but tend to blow off. ""To improve your orgasms, you need to commit to doing Kegels. They really work,"" Herbenick says. Another easy orgasm enhancer? Breathing. While many women hold their breath during climax, doing so can reduce the sensation. Instead, take shallow, rapid breaths right up to and during your climax. ""Quick breaths reduce blood levels of carbon dioxide, possibly making vaginal contractions more intense,"" says Robert Fried, Ph.D., a professor of biopsychology at Hunter College who studies anxiety and breathing.</p><p>While your body is pumping out waves of tingly goodness, your mind falls into a contented trance. The nucleus accumbens, where the brain produces pleasurable feelings (including addictive ones like those you can get from nicotine or drugs), is activated, says Komisaruk. That's why you may feel as if you can't get enough of your partner-even one you're lukewarm about-during pleasure. Meanwhile, the brain's amygdala and prefrontal cortex, which process fear and anxiety, become less active, says neuroscientist Gert Holstege, Ph.D., a professor of uroneurology at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. ""Our research found that women need to be in a relaxed, comfortable place in order to climax,"" Holstege says. ""The brain is built for survival and procreation. So when you're having sex (even if it's not to procreate), your brain gets the green light to orgasm when no danger or worry is present.""</p><p><strong>Seconds, Anyone?</strong><br />Soon after an orgasm, your blood pressure and pulse settle down, and blood begins to retreat slowly from your genitals and for more. ""One advantage women have over men is the ability to achieve multiple orgasms,"" Herbenick says. ""Blood drains from the penis rather quickly, but it stays longer in the vagina, which keeps a woman aroused."" Wait until your clitoris is less sensitive-it could take a few seconds or a few minutes-and then have him stimulate you manually or orally to start building to another peak.<br /><br />According to Helen Fisher, Ph.D., author of <em>Why We Love</em>, once you've filled your pleasure quota, you'll probably fall into cuddle mode, because there's still leftover oxytocin (the bonding hormone) floating around from your orgasm, making you feel especially attached to the person who brought you all that glory.</p><p></p>",

Without them, we couldn't think or even breathe, much less digest food or walk the dog. But chances are you're not getting enough of the good stuff, and figuring out what you need is tricky business. We uncover the key nutrients young women should consume, plus which you should get from food and what's OK to buy in a bottle.</p><p><strong>Vitamin A</strong><br />Talk about your overachiever: This antioxidant boosts immune systems, improves vision, cuts risk of heart disease, and may slow skin aging. But, warns Michael Holick, Ph.D., M.D., author of <em>The Vitamin D Solution</em>, it can be toxic in large doses, so stick with the right amount.</p><p>Recommended daily dosage: 2,300 international units (IU)</p><p>Need a supplement? It's best to get A from a beta-carotene source, such as a large carrot or a cup of sliced cantaloupe</p><p><strong>B Vitamins</strong><br />The eight B vitamins help maintain metabolism, muscle tone, and a sharp mind, says Mary Ellen Camire, Ph.D., a nutrition professor at the University of Maine at Orono. Most important for young women is B9 (folic acid), which keeps red blood cells healthy and guards against cancer and birth defects.</p><p><strong>Recommended daily folate dosage:</strong> 400 micrograms (mcg); 600 mcg if you're pregnant</p><p><strong>Need a supplement?</strong> Probably not (unless you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant), particularly if you eat grains. Just one cup of most fortified breakfast cereals has all the daily B you need. Other options: whole-grain breads, asparagus, and beans.</p><p><strong>Vitamin C</strong><br />Despite its rep as a cold fighter, C has never been proven to prevent or cure the sniffles. But the antioxidant is believed to boost your immune system and help prevent heart disease, prenatal problems, and eye illnesses. It even helps wounds heal faster and fends off wrinkles.</p><p><strong>Recommended daily dosage:</strong> 75 milligrams (mg)</p><p><strong>Need a supplement?</strong> No, as long as you eat citrus fruits and vibrant veggies. A single orange is packed with nearly all of your daily C. So is one red pepper or a cup of broccoli.</p><p><strong>Vitamin D</strong><br />The vitamin du jour, D could be something of a wonder drug. Docs believe it can reduce your risk of breast cancer by as much as 50 percent, and it may offer protection from both ovarian cancer and diabetes. More happiness: D helps calcium absorption and plays a central role in muscle function.</p><p><strong>Recommended daily dosage:</strong> 1,000 to 2,000 IU</p><p><strong>Need a supplement?</strong> Most likely. Milk, orange juice, and salmon contain small amounts of D, but nowhere near enough.</p><p><strong>Calcium</strong><br />Two words: strong bones. ""Women start losing bone density in their twenties,"" says Camire. ""Calcium is your single best defense, and you should start taking it now."" The mineral also helps build strong teeth and nourishes your nervous system.</p><p><strong>Recommended daily dosage:</strong> 1,000 mg</p><p><strong>Need a supplement?</strong> Yep. Yogurt, milk, and cheese do pack calcium, but not an ideal amount</p><p><strong>Iron</strong><br />Too little of this mineral can spell anemia (a lack of red blood cells) and a weakened immune system. Iron is also ""particularly important for women with heavy periods,"" says Carol Haggans, R.D., a consultant for the National Institutes of Health.</p><p><strong>Recommended daily dosage:</strong> 18 mg</p><p><strong>Need a supplement?</strong> Maybe. You can get your fill from one cup of some breakfast cereals. But if you don't frequently munch the crunchy stuff-or iron-rich foods like red meat-you might want to pop a pill. Just talk to your doc first; too much can be harmful.</p>",
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/aging-advice,Life,211,178,317,16,3,10,7,0,,Look Young: Your Fanny or Your Face?,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1010-fanny-face.jpg,"<p>It's another sunny day in Miami Beach, and the waiting room of cosmetic dermatologist Leslie Baumann, M.D., is packed with lean, bronzed women, lined up like pretzel sticks in a box. Among them is Sarah,* the 39-year-old host of a local TV show, who's frantic about her glabellar lines-that's skin-speak for the vertical lines (a.k.a. 11's) that tend to show up between the eyebrows when you hit your mid to late thirties. She seems a little annoyed, but that's partly the lines' fault.<br /><br /><br /><br />See, in addition to making you look older, they can give you a slightly pissed-off appearance. Old and angry isn't a look any woman covets, certainly not one who makes her living as a personality on a morning television show.<br /><br /><br /><br />From the neck down, Sarah could pass for a high school athlete. Weighing in at 120 pounds, with a tight little butt and flat abs, she's fitter than she was as a teenager. The old face/young body contradiction is one that's familiar to Baumann, who has been known to tell clients in the past, ""Sorry, you just might have to choose between your face and your rear end.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Her words echo a quote that is often attributed to French actress Catherine Deneuve, who reportedly said, ""After a certain age, you have to choose between your fanny and your face."" Here's what she meant: Many of the things you do in the name of staying in shape-counting calories, tallying fat grams, following a uber-healthy <a href=""/nutrition/the-ultimate-nutrition-plan-0"">nutrition plan</a>, logging hours at the gym-begin to do a number on your face as you close in on 40. You start to lose facial volume, which can cause eyes to look slightly sunken, cheeks to hollow out, and skin to lose its firmness and elasticity. Maintaining a low body mass index (BMI) exacerbates the problem because fat is the very thing that helps plump out lines and wrinkles.<br /><br /><br /><br />""When you lose weight, the face is the first place that shows it,"" says Baumann, who conducts research at the Baumann Cosmetic & Research Institute, in addition to treating patients in her office. ""The fat pads under the eyes go first, then you see it above the smile and down to the chin, then the cheeks."" At the same time, gravity comes into play, and the elastin and collagen fibers that allow skin to stretch and spring back weaken, causing skin to sag.<br /><br /><br /><br />All of which leaves Sarah (and women like her) with a rather unappealing choice: carry an extra 10-plus pounds to keep her face looking youthful, or keep her weight down and wear an extra 10-plus years on her face. But do we have to compromise? Or is there a way to have both our face and our derriere fight gravity? We turned to experts in the fields of dermatology, nutrition, and exercise physiology to find out.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Facing the Music</b><br /><br /><br />As early as your mid-twenties, faint creases start to appear on your face-usually across your brow and around your eyes. In your mid-thirties, those creases kick off their shoes and make themselves at home, settling in as full-fledged lines. Soon after, crow's-feet and smile lines join the party, and the dreaded 11's hit you where it hurts: right between the eyes. As you lose volume in the upper part of your face, the lower part starts to sag. Tending to these changes can feel like a game of Whac-A-Mole-as soon as one problem is addressed, another pops up.<br /><br /><br /><br />""To maintain youthfulness, the human face begs to have fullness,"" says Rod Rohrich, M.D., professor and chairman of the department of plastic surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. And by fullness he means fat-whether it gets there the old-fashioned way or with the help of a dermatologist or plastic surgeon.<br /><br /><br /><br />In 2007, Rohrich led a groundbreaking study at UT Southwestern that shed light on just how important fat is for the face. Prior to his research, skin-care experts believed that subcutaneous facial fat (the fat just below the surface of the skin) was one confluent mass that aged at the same rate. Rohrich and his team discovered that the face is actually made up of 21 individual fat compartments, each of which ages at a different pace. Imagine your face as a three-dimensional puzzle, with fat divided into distinct units around the forehead, eyes, cheeks, and mouth. The way your face ages is at least partially characterized by how these separate compartments evolve as you grow older. Staying too thin can eventually cause some or all of those compartments to sag like day-old party balloons.<br /><br /><br /><br />To keep those fat compartments looking as if they're positioned beneath the skin of a twenty-something, you need to maintain about 15 percent body fat, says Doris Day, M.D., a clinical assistant professor of dermatology at New York University Langone Medical Center and author of Forget the Facelift. Women with naturally fuller faces have more leeway because they have more fat in each compartment. On the flip side, ""women with thin, angular faces may need 20 to 25 percent body fat to keep a youthful face,"" says Day. Especially in their forties.<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Double Trouble</b><br /><br /><br />Research on twins illustrates just how much weight affects the signs of aging. When they were young girls growing up outside of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, no one could tell twin sisters Lisa Cline and Laurie Baun apart. Both had blond hair and button noses-and both were considerably overweight. During their senior year of high school, however, Laurie was diagnosed with a digestive disease and dropped 20 pounds. Over the next few years, she lost another 25 pounds. Initially, her slimmer body made her look much younger than her sister. Now, at 49, she appears several years older than Lisa.<br /><br /><br /><br />The sisters were among 186 pairs of identical female twins enlisted for a 2008 study at Case Western Reserve University. Researchers set out to determine how much of facial aging is genetically predetermined and how much of it has to do with lifestyle. Turns out, only a small part has to do with genes; most of what ages you can be traced to lifestyle habits and environment. ""Your heritage may initially dictate how you age, but if you introduce certain factors into your life, you will age faster,"" says lead study author Bahman Guyuron, M.D., professor and chairman of the department of plastic surgery at University Hospitals and Case Western Reserve University. ""Likewise, if you avoid those factors, you can slow down the hands of time.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Guyuron and his team found that sun exposure is the biggest age accelerator, followed closely by smoking-hardly a surprise. What was eye-opening, however, was how big a role weight played in the aging process. Under the age of 40, the heavier twin (typically with a BMI four points higher than that of her sister, the equivalent of roughly 20 pounds) looked significantly older. But after 40, that same four-point difference in BMI made the heavier twin look significantly younger. And not just because the extra fat plumps up facial skin and fills out wrinkles, says Guyuron. It also makes skin look lighter, giving it a healthier glow. The findings tended to be even more dramatic among twins over 55.<br /><br /><br /><br />Of course, Guyuron isn't recommending that anyone gain an unhealthy amount of weight in an effort to look younger. He admits one drawback of the study is that he and his research team made their evaluations using only photos of the twins' faces. If their bodies had been shown, a few years may have been shaved off members of the lean group and added to those in the heavier group. Regardless, ""it was clear that excessive weight loss can be detrimental to youthfulness and attractiveness,'' says Guyuron.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Exercise as an Accelerator</b><br /><br /><br />If you happen to catch a footrace anywhere in America, you're going to see beautifully muscled legs, slim hips, and bikini-ready abs. But the picture gets less pretty as you scroll up. The assumption has always been that the constant pavement pounding associated with running breaks down facial collagen, but there's no research to support that. Experts now say a lower-than-average BMI is the likelier culprit, echoing Guyuron's findings. ""It's true that runners often have a more weathered look, but it's not because gravity is pulling at their faces,"" explains exercise physiologist Ana Lourdes Gomez, Ph.D., a research scientist at the University of Connecticut. ""It basically boils down to two factors: Runners tend to be lean, so they have less subcutaneous fat, and they spend more time in the sun.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Baumann concurs: ""If you're always exercising outside, you're going to wind up with free-radical damage,"" she says. ""And free-radical damage is what breaks down collagen."" Still, it's a risk some tan-obsessed exercisers are willing to take. ""Many people seek fitness not for health but for attractiveness-to get a sexy-looking body-and tanning is just another way to improve attractiveness,"" says Joel Hillhouse, Ph.D., a professor in the department of community health at East Tennessee State University who has done research on the psychology of tanning. ""There is also the perception that being tan helps better define a toned body, that it shows off fit muscles.""<br /><br /><br /><br />That's not to say gym rats, yoga buffs, and other indoor exercisers are immune to accelerated aging. ""If they're too thin because they're working out a lot and not eating enough, it will show in their faces,"" says Gomez, ""but not to the degree of, say, runners, bikers, and tennis players, who have the sun to contend with too.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Sweet Spot of Attractiveness</b><br /><br /><br />In the quest to have both a fit bod and a firm face, Sarah has turned to injectables, which is the reason for her visit to Baumann's office today. These nonsurgical procedures include smoothers (like Botox or, in Sarah's case, Dysport, a newer version of Botox) that reduce lines and wrinkles by relaxing facial muscles, and fillers (Radiesse, Restylane, Juvederm, and Sculptra, among them) that use hyaluronic acid, synthetic substances, or even fat from your own body to target wrinkles and add volume to cheeks, temples, and other areas of the face. In other words, derms are able to inject your fanny into your face. How's that for irony?<br /><br /><br /><br />But if you aren't keen on resorting to extreme dermatologic interventions, here's the best advice:<br /><br /><br /><br />While exercising outside can wreak havoc on your skin, working out in general has been found to help it. A 2008 study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that regular exercisers had longer telomeres, tags at the ends of chromosomes that shorten with age. People who did even a moderate amount of cardio-about three 30-minute sessions a week-had telomeres that looked like those of someone about six years younger. Other studies suggest that cardio reduces stress-another major factor in aging, according to Guyuron's twins study, which found that people who'd been through the rigors of a divorce looked almost two years older than their married, single, or even widowed siblings.<br /><br /><br /><br />""When you're feeling stressed, you use muscles that are synergistic with the gravity effect,"" explains Guyuron. ""Gravity pulls the neck, creating and deepening two lines between the chin and the neck. The more stress you go through in your life, the more visible those lines are going to become.""<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Some experts believe exercises specifically for the face can erase these lines. Facial yoga, for instance, combines traditional yoga poses that are believed to make your face look younger (downward dog, for one, increases blood flow to the head) with moves that take their cue from the yogic tradition of deep breathing (like puffing up your cheeks with air, then transferring the air from cheek to cheek while exhaling).<br /><br /><br /><br />These moves supposedly boost the production of elastin and collagen. Baumann is conducting a study to determine whether they do or not, so we'll have to wait and see.<br /><br /><br /><br />What's certain is that a healthy diet is as important for your face as it is for your fanny. Research suggests that noshing on foods packed with antioxidants-fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, mackerel, and sardines, and richly colored fruits and veggies-may improve skin tone and boost metabolism too.<br /><br /><br /><br />In fact, the fountain of youth appears to be filled with fish oil. The slippery stuff has been shown to act as an anti-inflammatory (which helps maintain elasticity and suppleness in the skin) and to lower levels of leptin, a hormone that regulates appetite and metabolism. A University of Wisconsin study found that subjects with low levels of leptin have faster metabolisms and are able to burn fat more quickly than those with higher levels. To reap the rewards, consume 2,000 milligrams of fish oil a day, suggests Stephen Gullo, Ph.D., a weight-loss expert in New York City and author of The Thin Commandments.<br /><br /><br /><br />Conversely, eating foods that are loaded with preservatives-those unpronounceable ingredients listed on the labels of many prepackaged foods-""can irritate the digestive system, and the skin is the first place you'll see a change,"" says Ashley Koff, R.D., a nutritionist in Los Angeles. (The second place is your thighs, belly, or wherever else you tend to pack on pounds.) Many of Koff's clients turn to diet soda to satisfy a sweet tooth, but artificial sweeteners can lead to overeating, and the caffeine may act as a mild diuretic. Plus, a new study published in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Journal found that high levels of phosphates-found in many soft drinks and processed foods-accelerate the signs of aging. ""It displaces calcium, and that affects skin health, among other things, because calcium helps regulate the skin's thickness and color,"" says Koff.<br /><br /><br /><br />Perhaps one of the smartest things you can do throughout your life is to maintain a healthy weight, since so-called yo-yo dieting is brutal on the face. (Imagine stretching a rubber band over and over again; it eventually becomes less resilient and loses its elasticity altogether.) ""If you've been gaining and losing weight for years-particularly if you're doing it rapidly-you shed not only body fat but also lean body mass and the supple underlying muscular structure in your face,"" says Susan Bowerman, R.D., assistant director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of California at Los Angeles. ""That contributes to your face looking older. These kinds of fluctuations are bad for both your face and your health.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Making matters worse, your face responds to weight fluctuations the same way your body does: You lose it first where you need it most (mid-face-between the cheekbones and that area from your nose to the corners of your mouth) and that's where you gain it back last.<br /><br /><br /><br />In the end, the secret to looking young and staying fit isn't really much of a secret at all, but something we've known all along: Eat right, exercise often, slather on sunscreen every single day (SPF 30, please), and follow the bonus advice in this article. Also, developing a healthy attitude toward aging doesn't hurt either. Everyone is going to wind up with a few wrinkles at some point, and those lines won't diminish your beauty. Want proof? Just take a look at Catherine Deneuve.<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p>",

You have to be committed to health and fitness to see lasting results. But occasionally ""cheating"" during your workout won't mess with your fitness goals-in fact, it can even help. The trick is to cheat wisely so that your shortcuts never turn into setbacks. Follow this guide.</p><p><strong>The cheat:</strong> Stopping to walk during a run<br /><strong>The verdict:</strong> Go for it</p><p>Taking short walk breaks helps you run farther, burn more calories, and sidestep injury, says exercise physiologist Tom Holland, author of Beat the Gym. So whether you're working up to three miles or training for a long-distance event, walking now and then can serve as a useful tool to build up your mileage and endurance. Just make sure you're stopping only two or three times during a 30-minute run, for about 30 to 60 seconds a pop.</p><p><strong>The cheat:</strong> Not stretching before a workout<br /><strong>The verdict:</strong> Go for it</p><p>While research shows that stretching after a workout can boost strength, prevent injury, and increase range of motion, a 2010 study of almost 1,400 runners found that limbering up before exercise may have few-if any-benefits. To get your blood flowing and muscles prepped, dynamic movements are more effective, says Katie Rothstein, an exercise physiologist at the Orthopedic & Rheumatology Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. Exercises like arm swings and butt kicks increase your joints' range of motion and prime your muscles for action. Find dynamic movements at WomensHealth Mag.com/Stretch-Workout.</p><p><strong>The cheat:</strong> Skipping the last three reps<br /><strong>The verdict:</strong> Bad idea</p><p>The final reps of a move are where the magic happens. ""You have to stress your muscles if you want them to change, and that occurs in those last few reps,"" says Holland. Your last reps should be tough to finish but not so difficult that you have to compromise your form. If your form starts to suffer early in the set, switch to a lower weight so you won't have to skip the last reps-or hurt yourself trying to push through them.</p><p><strong>The cheat:</strong> Resting longer than the prescribed time during a circuit<br /><strong>The verdict:</strong> Go for it</p><p>Many circuits call for short rests-usually 30 to 60 seconds-to keep your heart rate high enough to produce a cardio benefit (read: calorie burn). But if you're really struggling after a tough set, tack on an extra 30 seconds of rest, says Rebecca Stephenson, a board-certified women's health specialist in physical therapy at Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital. It will give you (and your muscles) enough of a breather to complete the next set with perfect form-without compromising your calorie burn.</p><p><strong>The cheat:</strong> Exercising in the morning when you're dead tired<br /><strong>The verdict:</strong> Bad idea</p><p>If you truly didn't get enough shut-eye (you rolled in at 3 a.m. or you were up all night with a crying baby), crawl back under the covers. A study found that when dieters were sleep deprived they lost less body fat and more lean muscle mass than when they tallied more Z's. What's more, exercising when you're too drained can take your focus off proper form, upping your risk of injury.</p><p>If you're just feeling groggy, get your butt out of bed by committing to do half of your workout, suggests Michele Olson, Ph.D., a professor of exercise science at Auburn University in Alabama. Chances are, you'll pick up steam as you go and bang out the whole thing. ""Knowing that you can cut it short will get you out the door, which is the hardest part,"" she says.</p><p><strong>The cheat:</strong> Leaving class before the cooldown<br /><strong>The verdict:</strong> Go for it</p><p>Letting your heart rate slowly come down after a workout is a must, but skipping a guided cooldown isn't a big deal, says Holland. Simply walking to the locker room or your car will help ease your body back to its regular core temperature and heart rate, and circulate blood from the muscles you just worked back to your organs. In fact, this is why the stroll to baggage claim after a marathon is so long, says Holland. Sitting or standing still after a long or intense workout can cause the blood in your extremities to pool, which can lead to cramping or even fainting.</p><p><strong>The cheat:</strong> Blowing off lower-body strength training<br /><strong>The verdict:</strong> Bad idea</p><p>Your leg muscles do get a workout during cardio, but you need to hit the weights (or do squats or lunges) to make sure you're hitting all of your muscle groups. ""Muscles work in pairs, and when you stick to one type of cardio, you train only half of the pair,"" says Holland. ""Strength training corrects these imbalances, so you stay injury-free and get great-looking legs to boot.""</p><p>Supplement your cardio regimen with at least two lower-body or total-body strength workouts a week, or combine strength and cardio by doing plyometric supersets (explosive moves like squat jumps and split lunge jumps done back-to-back without rest), says Holland.</p><p><strong>The cheat:</strong> Not drinking H20 during exercise<br /><strong>The verdict:</strong> Depends Unless you're working out for more than an hour or you're sweating profusely, you can get away with sipping six ounces before and at least 10 ounces after a sweat session, says Rebecca Stephenson, of Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital.</p>",
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/eat-and-lose-weight,Weight Loss,187,169,15,95,6,296,4,0,,"Eat More, Lose More Weight",http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/eat-more-art.jpg,"<p>Inside your body, a war is waging between the cells that make up muscle and those that make up fat. How can you be sure muscle wins the battle? By following these five slim-down strategies from our new book, <i>The</i> Women's Health <i>Diet</i>. You'll drop pounds and earn a lean physique-minus the hunger pangs.</p><p><strong>I Will Eat it if it Grows on a Tree</strong><br />Or a bush, stalk, or vine. Your goal is to fill your body with as many fat-discouraging nutrients as possible, and the very best sources of them are fruits and vegetables-and nuts too. A study at the University of California at Los Angeles found that the typical normal-weight person consumed about two servings of fruit a day, while the average overweight person ate just one a day. Another study found that eating fruit at the beginning of a meal reduces overall calorie intake by 15 percent.</p><p>Eating from trees will also give you more omega-3 fatty acids, which help fight abdominal fat. Some great plant sources of omega-3s are walnuts and flaxseeds.</p><p><strong>Your Plan:</strong> Include fruits and vegetables in every meal and most snacks.</p><p><strong>Slim-Down Trick:</strong> Eat these slimming foods first. You'll consume fewer calories from other foods, and the fiber will help reduce blood-sugar swings that lead to hunger.</p><p><strong>I Will Eat Protein with Every Meal and Snack</strong><br />Muscle growth is triggered by protein-rich foods. In fact, every time you eat 10 to 15 grams of protein, you stimulate a burst of protein synthesis that helps build muscle. And when you take in 30 grams, that period lasts about three hours.</p><p>""The most important diet upgrade for people who want to lose weight is to eat protein for breakfast,"" says Louis Aronne, M.D., director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Program at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. In one study, people who started their day with a meal of eggs dropped 65 percent more weight than those who ate bagels.</p><p><strong>Your Plan:</strong> Aim to eat between 0.54 and one gram of protein per pound of body weight. Base this on your goal body weight. So if you want to weigh 130 pounds, you should eat 70 to 130 grams of protein a day.</p><p><strong>Slim-Down Trick:</strong> Eat more dairy. Researchers found that people who ate three servings a day were 60 percent less likely to be overweight than those who consumed fewer than that.</p><p><strong>I Will Eat Before and After Exercise</strong><br />Here's great news if you love to eat: You probably need to nosh more. Eating a snack of protein and carbs right before and after working out speeds muscle growth and recovery. Also, fueling up can limit the effects of cortisol, the stress hormone that tells your body to store fat. As a result, you burn more fat during your workout and for the next 24 hours.</p><p><strong>Your Plan:</strong> Have a carb-and-protein snack 30 minutes before working out and a protein-rich meal after. The longer you wait to eat after exercising, the more your body will break down existing muscle and the less it will build new muscle.</p><p><strong>Slim-Down Trick:</strong> Drinking a smoothie is a quick and easy way to get a protein boost after a workout. For tasty recipes, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/healthy-smoothie-recipes"">click here</a>.</p><p><strong>I Will Become a Salad Savant</strong><br />Salads deliver wildly important nutrients that aid weight loss. A prime example: folate, a B vitamin in leafy greens. A study found that dieters who ate the most folate lost 8.5 times as much weight as those who ate the least.</p><p><strong>Your Plan:</strong> Consume as many leafy greens as you can. Besides eating salad, add spinach to omelets and quiches.</p><p><strong>Slim-Down Trick:</strong> Use a dressing made with safflower oil. It contains linoleic acid, which may prevent fat storage.</p><p><strong>I Will Never Have the World's Worst Breakfast</strong><br />No, it's not leftover pizza-it's no breakfast at all. When you wake up, your body is fuel deprived. If you don't eat, you lower your metabolism, starve your muscles, and wind up taking in most of your calories late in the day. In fact, regularly skipping breakfast increases your risk for obesity by 450 percent.</p><p><strong>Your Plan:</strong> Eat 30 to 35 percent of your daily calories early. Match proteins with whole grains, produce, and healthy fats. If you don't have the time or appetite for a big meal, eat two small ones-have cereal early, then grab a yogurt and fruit to eat at work.</p><p><strong>Slim-Down Trick:</strong> Have absolutely zero interest in eating in the morning? At least drink a glass of 1 percent milk, which will give you eight grams of protein plus fat-burning calcium.</p>",

To hit these ranges, remove chilled whites from the fridge 20 minutes before serving; cool room-temp reds in an ice bucket for 10 minutes. <br /><b>Says who</b> Anthony Giglio, author of the forthcoming <i>Food & Wine Magazine Wine Guide 2009</i><br /><b>Why it matters </b>White wine isn't as flavorful when it's cold, and sipping it too chilled numbs your palate. Too-warm red wine may taste bitter and alcohol-y. Check out <a target=""_blank"" href=""/nutrition/wine-definitions""><i>WH</i>'s Wine Glossary</a>.</p><p><b>Does the ""white with fish, red with meat"" rule hold water?</b><br /><b>No. </b>The color of wine is less important than its origins and overall characteristics, to decide which is the best wine with particular meats . Lighter-bodied reds, like Oregon pinot noirs and chilled Sicilians, won't overpower salmon or swordfish steaks, and Alsatian whites and California chardonnays are heavy enough for pork or even beef. <br /><b>Says who</b> André H. Mack, corporate beverage director and sommelier of the Fireman Hospitality Group in New York City<br /><b>Why it matters</b> This rule made sense when whites were light and fruity and reds were heavy and intense, but times--and wines--have changed. <a target=""_blank"" href=""/nutrition/wine-recommendations""><b>Take a sip from all of <i>WH</i>'s White & Red Wine Recommendations</b></a>.</p><p><b>Corks or screwcaps?</b><br /><b>Screwcaps. </b>Traditionalist wine experts may scoff, but wine stays purer under a screwcap than under any other closure. In New Zealand alone, screwcap use has risen from zero to an estimated 90 percent in five years.<br /><b>Says who</b> Co Dinn, director of winemaking for Hogue Cellars in Prosser, Washington.<br /><b>Why it matters</b> Cork bark is riddled with natural im­perfections, so it can leak or impart flavors to a wine. Failure rates are 2 to 12 percent. </p><p><b>Does letting wine breathe really do anything?</b><br /><b>Yes.</b> Oxygen does the same thing for wine that it does for you during a <a href=""/fitness"">quick run</a>: helps it loosen up (for wine, that often results in a more intense flavor). Not convinced? Pour half a bottle into a carafe, decanter, or generous-size glass and let it sit for up to 15 minutes before drinking. Then compare it with a glass from a freshly uncorked bottle. You'll notice more flavor in the wine that got air.<br /><b>Says who</b> Karen MacNeil, author of <i>The Wine Bible a</i>nd chair of the wine studies program at the Culinary Institute of America<br /><b>Why it matters</b> More complex wines, usually reds, benefit the most from breathing. Cabernet sauvignon, merlot, and syrah are three in particular that can taste harsh right out of the bottle. Letting them breathe will help them mellow out a little--and then you can do the same.</p><p><b>Can you save wine?</b><br /><b>Yes.</b> Recorking the bottle and stashing it in the fridge will buy your vino another 24 hours of drinkability. Cool temps slow the chemical changes that degrade wine. For the longest results, use the Presorvac system first, then refrigerate--you should be good for the next three to seven days. <br /><b>Says who</b> Larry Stone, master sommelier and general manager of Rubicon Estate, Napa Valley, CA <br /><b>Why it matters</b> Oxidation and the growth of the bacteria that produce vinegar will eventually make any open bottle unpalatable, but exactly when a wine is no longer fit to drink depends on the wine and your personal taste. Robust young reds like cabernets and syrahs tend to last longest, while lighter reds (like pinots), older reds, and most whites are best within an hour after uncorking.</p><p><b>Is the year a wine was produced actually important?</b><br /><b>Not really. </b>Most widely available everyday wines come from places where the climate is consistently hot and dry--California, Chile, Australia--so the quality of the grapes doesn't change very much from year to year.<br /><b>Says who </b>David Lynch, author of <i>Vino Italiano</i><br /><b>Why it matters</b> You will notice differences in taste from year to year when the wine comes from a finicky climate.

Four years later, busy with graduate school and her job at a software company, Leigh blew off her workouts and stopped monitoring her portions...and shot up to 175. ""It was so sad, so frustrating,"" she says. ""I let myself down.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Along with the emotional toll is a physical one: Not only is the extra weight a health risk, but recent studies have linked the gain-lose-gain cycle to such potentially life-threatening conditions as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, depression, heart disease, and cancer.<br /><br /><b>Understanding Metabolic Math</b><br />While small fluctuations on the scale are normal, the unhealthy behavior that experts refer to as ""weight cycling"" is not. Cycling is defined as a significant increase or decrease of body weight (generally 10 pounds or more) that occurs multiple times.<br /><br />Experts believe a yo-yo pattern is often the result of a diet that's too restrictive, and a study reported in the journal Obesity backs that up: It found that people who followed a very low-calorie diet regained significantly more weight than those on a more forgiving plan. Desperate for quick results in a culture of instant gratification, ""women try to lose weight on diets with too few calories,"" says Judith Beck, Ph.D., director of the Beck Institute of Cognitive Therapy and author of <i>The Beck Diet Solution</i>. ""If you lose weight on 1,200 calories a day, the minute you go up to 1,300 is the minute you start gaining weight.""<br /><br />It happened to Tracy Srail. The 24-year-old from Atlanta has watched the scale bounce between 130 and 160 pounds for the past four years. ""At one point, I was eating only one or two meals a day and chugging Rockstar energy drinks because I heard that caffeine increases your metabolism. I lost 15 pounds, but it didn't stick,"" she says. ""I weigh about 155 now.""<br /><br />Even on a sensible diet, your body sheds pounds reluctantly. ""One reason it's difficult to keep weight off is because there is a metabolic overcompensation for weight loss,"" says Gary Foster, Ph.D., director of the Center of Obesity Research and Education at Temple University in Philadelphia. ""If you decrease your body mass by 10 percent, you would expect your metabolic rate to decrease by 10 percent, but it actually slows down more than that, by about 11 to 15 percent.""<br /><br />Why does your own metabolism thwart you? Simple, says Kelly Brownell, M.D., director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University: ""The body may perceive dieting as a threat to its survival. It might not know the difference between Atkins and famine.""<br /><br />What's more, says Brownell, who coined the term ""yo-yo dieting"" in the 1980s, weight cycling can actually change your physiology. So the more diets you've been on, the harder it becomes to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/set/?keycode=142686"">lose the weight</a>. A hunger hormone called ghrelin increases, and a fullness hormone called leptin decreases, so you feel hungrier and less satiated.<br /><br /><b>Born to Rebound?</b><br />It's bad enough that your body fights you when you try to lose weight. Now there's compelling research to show that some people may be hardwired to yo-yo.<br /><br />David Kessler, M.D., former U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner and author of <i>The End of Overeating</i>, and his team of researchers at the University of California at San Francisco and Yale University, looked into the biology of weight cycling. They found that the reward circuits in the brains of people Kessler calls ""conditioned hypereaters"" were excessively activated simply by the smell of food and stayed that way until those people finished eating whatever was on the plate in front of them.<br /><br />In other words, when you have overactive neural circuitry, resisting temptation is not a question of willpower alone. ""This is a biological cause of conditioned hypereating. It's the first time we can say 'It's not your fault,' "" Kessler says. He estimates that 50 percent of obese people and 30 percent of overweight people are conditioned hypereaters.<br /><br />Evidence shows, however, that this reaction is partially learned, and that through conditioning, you can rewire your brain. After all, the yen to yo-yo is not just physical; emotional triggers play a huge role too. A study at Brown University found that dieters who ate in response to emotions such as stress or loneliness-as opposed to external events, like overdoing it at happy hour-were more likely to regain weight.<br /><br />When Darcie Schmidt of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, was in her late twenties, she lost 75 pounds and then regained 120 over two years, largely because of emotional eating, she says. In her early thirties, she stuck to a strict diet-and-exercise regimen and shed 132 pounds. ""I did not eat a single chip for 18 months,"" she says. But the stress of a divorce, a move, and a return to school knocked her off track, and she traded her three-mile, five-day-a-week runs for bags of those verboten chips-and regained 40 pounds.<br /><br />Beck sees women like Schmidt all the time, who do well for a while, only to fall off the wagon. The problem, she believes, is that they never learned the skills needed for long-term behavior change. ""They haven't been taught how to motivate themselves every day,"" Beck says, ""or how to respond to negative thoughts and recognize a mistake as a one-time thing.""<br /><br />A study of 200 overweight and obese people, published in the <i>Journal of Psychosomatic Research</i>, supports the importance of a behavior-change approach. Along with other weight-loss techniques, one group received an additional hour of therapy, in which they learned to change their behavior; the other group did an extra hour of low-intensity exercise. After a year, those in the therapy group had maintained their weight loss, while the other group's members hadn't. <br /><br /><b>Risky Bigness</b><br />While watching the numbers on the scale fluctuate wildly is a blues inducer and clothes-budget buster, there are far more compelling reasons to hold steady. For one, your metabolism might be affected-and not in the way you probably hoped.<br /><br />""If you go on a very strict diet and gain the weight back quickly, you might lose a lot of muscle and regain a lot of fat,"" says Keith Ayoob, M.D., R.D., an associate professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. ""Then your metabolism operates on a slower idle, which means it's going to be harder to lose weight as time goes on.""<br /><br />The more times you yo-yo, the theory goes, the more fat your body gains in each rebound. Because muscle burns 10 times more calories than fat does, your metabolism eventually will slow to a crawl.<br /><br />""Losing and gaining regularly takes a huge toll on your body,"" Ayoob says. Beyond aesthetics, such as a loss of skin elasticity, regaining weight burdens your arteries and skeletal system, and may stress the liver, which can become covered in fat.<br /><br />Yo-yoing also does a number on your ticker: A study in <i>Clinical Cardiology</i> found that women who weight cycle five times or more during their lifetimes may be damaging their hearts in the process.<br /><br />But perhaps most startling is the dangerous and lasting effect weight cycling has on the immune system. According to the first study of the long-term impacts of yo-yo dieting, women who repeatedly lost and gained weight had lower immune function, particularly lower counts of natural killer cells. ""These cells are important for fending off infections and are also vital in fighting the early stages of cancer,"" says Cornelia Ulrich, M.D., of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. Low killer-cell activity is associated with higher rates of cancer. In her study of more than a hundred overweight but otherwise healthy women, those who had yo-yoed most frequently-five times or more-decreased their natural killer-cell activity by a third.<br /><br />With so many drawbacks, you might wonder if you'd be better off just accepting your belly rolls. But the perils of being overweight still outweigh the risks of yo-yoing. So how do you quit the cycle for good? Despite what you read in the tabloids, it is possible. <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/diet-information"">Here are our 8 tips for stopping the yo yo</a>.<br /><br />",

Then your friend requests that very dish before snapping the menu shut and handing it to the waiter. ""Make it two,"" you say. And there goes your diet.</p><p>Friends' health decisions have a funny way of rubbing off on us. So important is their power that the World Health Organization lists them as a determinant of health, as big a factor as genetics and income level. In fact, understanding how pals shape one another's health behavior has top billing in Healthy People 2010, the government's plan for improving national well-being.</p><p></p><p><br />Research has found that smoking, deciding to get the flu shot, and taking vitamins are all socially contagious behaviors. But where our friends have perhaps the most influence is on how much we eat, drink, and exercise.</p><p><strong>The (Fudge) Ripple Effect</strong><br />Having a buddy who packs on pounds makes you 57 percent more likely to do so yourself, according to the key findings of James Fowler, Ph.D., a professor at the University of California at San Diego, and Nicholas Christakis, M.D., Ph.D., a sociology professor at Harvard, who have studied social networks for 10 years. ""Consciously or unconsciously, people look to others when deciding what and how much to eat, and how much weight is too much,"" says Fowler.</p><p>So while you weren't planning to even glance at the dessert menu, you might change your mind when everyone else orders brownie sundaes. In some cases, we may even seek out relationships that allow us to indulge, says Susan Bowerman, R.D., of UCLA's Center for Human Nutrition. ""Many women have 'food friends' they can call up to say, 'I had a lousy day and some fried mozzarella sticks sure would make me feel better.'""</p><p>Your social circle influences your drinking habits too. Alcohol is a notorious diet buster (if you can resist a nacho after a margarita, bless you), and according to University of Pennsylvania researchers, drinking is among the ""risk behaviors"" that they found study participants were twice as likely to engage in if their friends did.</p><p>Part of the reason we're so easily swayed may be hardwired. Gregory Berns, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of psychiatry and economics at Emory University, found that when others influence us, the area of our brain that makes conscious decisions is not activated. Instead, the occipital lobe, where vision originates, lights up. Translation: We focus on what we see other people doing (like biting into a cupcake), not what we know is right for ourselves (biting into an apple).</p><p><strong>Unhealthy Competition</strong><br />Copycatting isn't always bad for your waistline. Research has found that you are just as likely to pick up good habits from pals. If everyone is ordering salad, do you want to be the one to splurge on a burger and fries? Same goes for booze. ""We want to behave appropriately, to make a good impression on others,"" says Patricia Pliner, Ph.D., professor at the University of Toronto at Mississauga.</p><p>Sounds admirable, right? Well, there's often a subtext in these civilized dinner scenes. When two girlfriends are competitive with each other-over guys, work, grades-it can manifest at the table. Undereating is a form of one-upmanship. In her study, Pliner found that when women competed against each other in a variety of skills, those who thought they were losing chose lighter entrees than their rivals at lunchtime. ""It was their way of winning,"" Pliner says. In another study, researchers found that even after being literally starved for more than 24 hours, women would consume only as much food (in some cases, as little as 300 calories) as their companions did.</p><p>Things can get especially ugly when friends try to sabotage each other-for instance, pressuring a dieting pal to go ahead and order those french fries or skip the gym. ""We don't want to be reminded of our own struggles with weight by watching a healthy eater make careful choices,"" Bowerman says. ""We want her to join our club.""</p><p><strong>Set Your Own Agenda</strong><br />Hanging with a calorie-conscious crew may keep you on the slim side, but what happens when you join a new club, move to a new town, or start a new job and begin socializing with a new group-one that eats fruit only if it's in a pie? Hint: You'll need to buy some new jeans. That's why it's important to get into the habit of making your own decisions about food. ""Being aware of how others influence us is an important first step,"" says Brent McFerran, Ph.D., an assistant professor of marketing at the University of British Columbia. ""If you recognize where you're likely to follow the crowd, you can correct your course."" He recommends pre-committing to your meal when you can: Bring your lunch to work, or if you're eating out, be the one who orders first. You'll find that a little independence will keep you healthier and happier in the long run.</p>",relationships
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/guy-and-girl-friends,Sex And Relationships,355,153,173,21,3,14,10,0,,Guy Friend: The Other Kind of Boyfriend,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1103-other-bff.jpg,"In my teens and twenties, my friendships were gender blind: More than half of the people I invited to my 24th birthday bash were platonic male friends. Nine years later, when planning my wedding, I was shocked to realize I contributed only one male friend to our guest list. It got me wondering: Why had most of my guy pals vanished from my life?<br /><br />The fact is, all friendships are hard to maintain once you are partnered up. According to researchers at the University of Oxford, the average person ends up losing at least two close pals when they settle into a relationship. The reasons are often pretty straightforward: Your new romance moves you to another state, your mate sucks up a lot of your spare time, you fall into a different life stage and no longer have as much in common with your old buds. Guy friends, it dawned on me, are even trickier to hold on to.<br /><br />Research is limited as to exactly why girl-guy friendships tend to bite the dust, but experts say it usually has something to do with a mate-either yours or his. ""Jealousy from a romantic partner is one of the primary costs of having a close friend of the opposite sex,"" explains April Bleske-Rechek, Ph.D., an associate professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire.<b><br /><br />The Case for Male Bonding</b><br />Despite the obstacles, experts agree there are specific boons that only male friendships can bring to your life. Getting a male point of view tops the list. ""Gaining an insider's perspective on how men think, feel, and behave is one of the advantages of an adult female-male friendship,"" says Michael Monsour, Ph.D., author of Women and Men as Friends. You and your girlfriends could speculate for hours as to why men do the things that vex you-or you could just ask a guy pal, who will break it down for you in 10 words or fewer, without all the stress. This intel can give you the upper hand in dealings with not only a boyfriend or a brother but also a male boss.<br /><br />Time spent with a dude is also usually free of the judgments women sometimes pass on each other-and that can be liberating. ""With their male friends, women can let it all hang out,"" says Heidi Reeder, Ph.D., an associate professor of communication at Boise State University. There's less dress-to-impress, less calorie counting, less competition in general.<br /><br />""Women are natural rivals, often competing for the same things in life,"" says Lynn Margolies, Ph.D., a psychologist in Newton, Massachusetts.<br /><br />""Men are seen by their female friends as being on a different playing field, with different measures of success."" Example: Your best guy friend is unlikely to feel twinges of jealousy when you tell him you're pregnant.<br /><br />And when it comes to maintenance, guy friends are more Chia Pet than English rose garden. ""People would tell me their female friends would be upset if they didn't call them for a week or show up at a party, but that their male friends require less attention,"" says Reeder. A drama-free relationship that's low on expectations and high on fun? What's not to love?<br /><br /><b>The More, the Merrier</b><br />If you're looking to expand your circle of male friends, here's some positive news: Thanks to loosened gender roles and far more equality in the workplace, men are easier to buddy up to than ever.<br /><br />""We've increased the coed reality of our lives,"" explains Reeder. Men and women, of course, have gone to the gym together and lived together as roommates for years and years. But these days, guys are even more likely to pop up in your cooking class or book club, and it's not unusual for a chick to show up at a poker night or join a fantasy football league. These common interests and shared experiences lay the groundwork for new platonic friendships.<br /><br />To make it clear you want to hang out and not hook up, communicate your intentions with words and actions. Asking a potential guy friend to grab dinner, for example, sends a very different message than suggesting he join you on an afternoon run. ""My best friend of 25 years is a woman, and for the first few years of our friendship we didn't hug each other, let alone sit in a dark movie theater, just the two of us,"" says Don O'Meara, Ph.D., a professor of sociology at the University of Cincinnati's Raymond Walters College.<br /><br />""Relationships gain identity from how outsiders define them, so it's equally crucial to confirm to everyone else that you're just friends.""<br /><br />",friendship

In a study in the <i>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</i>, dieters who used Enova lost more weight than those who used other oils. <br /><br /><b>Peanuts </b><br /><br />Ironically, this elephant favorite fights weight gain, slows rises in blood sugar, and curbs hunger. One study from Purdue University found that individuals who added 500 calories of peanuts to their diets for 3 weeks experienced almost no change in body weight and a 24 percent drop in triglycerides - blood fats associated with heart disease.

According to Michael B. Zemel, Ph.D., director of the Nutrition Institute at the of Tennessee, not getting enough calcium triggers the release of calcitriol, a hormone that causes us to store fat, whereas meeting our daily calcium needs helps us <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/burn-fat"">burn fat</a> more efficiently. Like turkey, yogurt and other dairy foods are leading sources of leucine, which also helps fight fat. <br /><br /><b>Breakfast Cereal</b><br /><br />By boosting fiber and providing fewer calories from fat than other popular breakfasts (bacon and eggs, anyone?), ready-to-eat cereal can help you fill up - and slim down.

It's not that he doesn't care--really it isn't--it's just that men process information much differently than women, and as a result, your words often get lost in translation. But don't <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/sex-benefits-0"">stress</a>, the solution is simple: Learn <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/talk-like-a-man"">how to talk to your man</a>. We've got great communicating tips. </p><p><b>Talk side by side</b><br />If you're broaching a potentially sticky subject (stuff like your wanting to get married, or his partying too much), avoid a face-to-face conversation. ""Although it seems counterintuitive, insisting on eye contact while hashing out an issue can actually make the problem worse,"" says Scott Haltzman, M. D., co-author of <i>The Secrets of Happily Married Women</i>. Looking him directly in the eye can make him feel threatened--and when confronted, men instinctively kick into survival mode, triggering a fight-or-flight response. To put him at ease, talk to your boyfriend while you're doing something side by side--walking, driving, eating dinner together on the sofa. </p><p><b>Cut to the chase </b><br />According to a study recently published in the journal <i>NeuroImage</i>, the <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/understanding-men"">male brain</a> interprets men's voices as speech and women's voices as music. That's why he can easily focus when one of his buddies drones on about some lame computer game, yet has to work overtime to concentrate on your bitch-of-a boss tale. To ensure that he hangs on your every word, make your point as quickly as possible. ""Men want to get to the bare bones of the matter,"" Haltzman says. ""So grab his attention by using direct statements such as 'Here's why I'm upset' or 'The bottom line is this.'"" </p><p><b>Let him know you need to vent </b><br />When you're telling your guy about your backstabbing best friend and he looks confused, it's not because you're not explaining yourself clearly or he's slow on the uptake. Biological differences make men innate problem solvers; the furrowed brow indicates that his mind is scrambling to find a solution. ""When a woman presents a man with a dilemma, he interprets this as a request to fix her problem, not to simply listen,"" Haltzman says. Clue him in by letting him know what you need before you make your point. Try prefacing your story with ""I just really need to get this off my chest."" By telling him what you expect up front, he'll know what to do and be able to give you what you really want: his ear. </p><p><b>Stroke his ego</b><br />If it seems like every time you ask him for a favor your words go in one ear and out the other, you may need to butter him up more. Men are brimming with <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/the-male-body"">testosterone</a>, which makes them competitive, and compliments help them feel important and superior. Let's say he never hangs out with your friends. Feed his ego by saying something like ""You're so funny! Actually, my friends could use some cheering up. Can you come out with us tonight?"" The positive reinforcement will challenge him to rise to the occasion, and the vote of confidence will make him feel needed. </p><p>How do you get through to your guy?

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/breathing-exercises,Health,123,148,47,22,1,40,13,0,,Improve Your Breathing Techniques,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/woman-breathing.jpg,"<p>You do it up to 22,000 times a day. But as it happens, most of us spend our entire lives breathing the wrong way, which can have some surprising negative effects on our health.<br /><br />Now that science has finally caught up to what yogis have been preaching for years, we know that proper breathing can help ease an overstressed mind, as well as play a big role in averting or alleviating heart disease, allergies, and weight gain. (Yes, you read that right: weight gain.)<br /><br />""Breathing is so simple-and free! People can't believe it works as a healing and preventative tool,"" says Herbert Benson, M.D., director emeritus of Boston's Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Do the following exercises regularly-twice a day, for 10 minutes each time-to help your body and mind navigate these issues.</p><p><strong>Anxiety</strong><br />""When you're anxious, you limit your breaths,"" says James S. Gordon, M.D., founder and director of the Center for Mind-Body Medicine in Washington, D.C., and author of <em>Unstuck: Your Guide to the Seven-Stage Journey Out of Depression</em>. ""And when you confine your breaths to your chest instead of using your diaphragm, you increase the anxiety."" The key to chilling out lies in calming your sympathetic nervous system (your body's fight-or-flight engine, which releases adrenaline and stress hormones such as cortisol) and triggering your parasympathetic nervous system, which controls your rest and digest functions and helps your muscles (and your mind) unwind. </p><p><strong>Try This: The Soft-Belly Technique</strong><br />Most people take about 15 breaths per minute, but when you're fretting, you should aim for six or seven slow, deep ones. Gordon suggests a technique that involves inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth, while keeping your stomach relaxed. To help yourself focus, slowly say the word soft in your head while inhaling, and speak the word belly as you breathe out. This technique can stimulate your vagus nerve, a central part of the parasympathetic nervous system, which runs through your abdomen and chest, and back to your brain stem. </p><p><strong>Heart Disease</strong><br />We're bombarded with sights, sounds, and emotions that put our nervous systems into overdrive. The result? Long periods of heightened blood pressure, adrenaline production, and heart rate, all of which are linked to heart disease. Breathing better can squash high blood pressure and elevated heart rate by activating that same relaxation response via your parasympathetic nervous system. </p><p><strong>Try This: Alternate Nostril Breathing</strong><br />This technique lowers your pulse rate and diastolic blood pressure, according to a study at Nepal Medical College. (The higher a young woman's diastolic blood pressure, the greater her risk for heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure.) David Magone, founder of the breath-oriented PranaVayu yoga practice, explains how to do it: Sit crosslegged and close your eyes. Use the thumb of your right hand to block your right nostril, and inhale deeply through the left for about six seconds. Now, cover your left nostril with the fourth finger of your right hand, release your right nostril, and exhale slowly for six seconds. With your left nostril blocked, breathe in through your right side for six seconds; then cover your right nostril again, release your left, and exhale for six seconds. Repeat the entire sequence for at least two minutes. </p><p><strong>Allergies</strong><br />When it comes to seasonal allergies, research has found that a little music-specifically, humming-can help you breathe better. Humming opens the ostia, which connect the sinuses to the nasal cavities, letting you take in air more easily, explains Timothy McCall, M.D., author of <em>Yoga as Medicine</em>. </p><p><strong>Try This: The Bee Breath</strong><br />Sitting in a comfortable position, take a deep breath through your nose, then let out a high-pitched humming sound as you exhale through your nose. You should feel a vibration in your nose, as well as in your chest and head. (McCall notes that humming tends to lengthen your exhales, making this another good breathing technique for those suffering from anxiety.) Continue for up to 10 minutes. </p><p><strong>Weight Gain</strong><br />If you've put on a few pounds, it might have as much to do with what's in your head as what's on your plate. ""Emotional stress can cause weight gain,"" says Dean Ornish, M.D., president of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, California. ""It speeds the conversion of calories to fat because you're more likely to overeat or make unhealthy choices when stressed."" Manage the stress, and you'll manage the weight. A great way to do that: Focus on slowing down your breathing, which will help reduce stress hormones. </p><p>Kelly McGonigal, Ph.D., author of <em>Yoga for Pain Relief</em>, points to another weight-gain factor that can be regulated by breathing: heart rate variability (HRV), the moment-bymoment fluctuation that can help determine how you respond to stress. ""Studies show that people with a high HRV tend to have more self-control, and those with low HRV are more likely to give in to temptation,"" she says. Like, say, that box of doughnuts. </p><p><strong>Try This: The Pursed-Lip Breath</strong><br />Slow, practiced breathing increases HRV and makes you more aware of your actions, so you're better able to lower your stress level and get a handle on overeating, McGonigal says. She suggests a four-second nasal inhale followed by an eight-second exhale through puckered lips (as if exhaling through a straw). Another option: the Hindu breathing method called ujjayi. Inhale through your nose for six seconds, then exhale through your mouth for six seconds as if you're trying to fog up a mirror, making a ""hahhhh"" sound while pulling in your abdomen. On your next breath, try making the same noise with your mouth closed. It should sound like a seashell against your ear, McGonigal notes. If you sound more like Darth Vader, you're probably doing it too forcefully.</p>",

You might be starting to wonder if you'd be better off just accepting your belly rolls. But we promise, the perils of being overweight still outweigh the risks of yo-yoing.<br /><br />So how do you quit the cycle for good? It is possible:</p><p><strong>Be realistic</strong><br />""Make sure your diet is one you can stick with,"" says Anne Fletcher, R.D., author of <em>Thin for Life</em>. No crash diets or fads that will be impossible to maintain. In fact, reconsider the whole notion of dieting as a temporary fix. Think of what you're doing as a permanent lifestyle shift: ""This is how I eat now.""</p><p><strong>Be patient</strong><br />Don't try to lose too much too soon. A healthy goal for slimming down, according to the National Institutes of Health, is to reduce your weight by approximately 10 percent over six months.</p><p><strong>Be supported</strong><br />Researchers have found that socializing with others who have successfully lost weight improves your odds of maintaining your own weight loss. So enlist a buddy or join a group.</p><p><strong>Be analytical</strong><br />Record your mood changes and hunger levels so you can learn to distinguish when you're eating for emotional reasons. </p><p><strong>Be vigilant</strong><br />""If you lose 30 pounds and then gain three, it's easy to think that's no big deal. But it's a slippery slope,"" says Gary Foster, Ph.D., director of the Center of Obesity Research and Education at Temple University in Philadelphia. Especially if you have a history of yo-yoing. Weigh yourself weekly, and have a clear plan of action ready if the scale swings too far. </p><p><strong>Be flexible</strong><br />""Switch eating plans if you get bored,"" says Michael Dansinger, M.D., weight-loss and nutrition advisor for The Biggest Loser and assistant professor at Tufts School of Medicine in Boston. Research indicates you're more likely to be successful. </p><p><strong>Be active</strong><br />Besides consuming a low-calorie, low-fat diet and being mindful about self-monitoring, you must exercise. This is the key strategy that keeps the 6,000 members of the National Weight Control Registry (an ongoing study of adults who have lost at least 30 pounds and kept it off for a year) from regaining weight. That doesn't mean you have to train for a marathon: Half an hour of walking every day is all you need to burn calories, build muscle, temper cravings, and increase ""feel good"" endorphin levels. </p><p><strong>Be optimistic</strong><br />""One of the most important tips for being a successful weight loser is not to let past failed attempts keep you from trying again,"" Dansinger says. ""Every time you fail, you get more insight about what to do differently next time.""</p>",

The problem comes in when you're not quite gutsy enough to try them out. Well, a new study from the journal <em>Appetite</em> offers an easy solution: Just smell a food you <em>do</em> like while you're eating the new one, and you're more likely to dig it. </p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/how-to-eat-healthier"">5 Excuses You Should Stop Making for Not Eating Healthier</a> <br /> <br />For the study, researchers morphed pictures of strawberries and tomatoes into ""unrecognizable"" images. Then, they showed the images to 56 volunteers and asked them to choose how much they liked each photo-while wafting tomato and strawberry scents under some (but not all) of the participants' noses.<br /> <br />So, what happened? It turns out that the participants who smelled the familiar tomato and strawberry scents as they were looking at the morphed photos rated them more favorably than those who didn't smell the scents-even though neither group recognized the images. Why? Scientists say that smelling a ""familiar"" food reduces your fear of a new food and therefore makes you more likely to try the novel one. In other words, smelling an old go-to makes you feel more comfortable and thus more likely to go out on a limb to try something different.<br /> <br />Your takeaway: Next time you go to the farmer's market, by all means pick up that weird-looking superfruit that everyone seems to be raving about. And if you find yourself a little squeamish about trying it, just eat it while you have your favorite yummy-smelling dish sitting right under your nose.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/refreshing-recipes"">12 Refreshing Recipes to Keep You Hydrated This Summer </a></p>","healthy eating,Scoop"

This article is part of that package. </em></p><p>Nearly half the women who took our WH-<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.acog.org"">ACOG</a> survey were stumped by which parts go where...and do what. Consider this a sex-ed refresher.</p><p><strong>1. Vagina</strong><br />It's the guardian of your reproductive parts: Its acid balance keeps harmful bacteria at bay. But it can also be accommodating: Shaped like a three-to four-inch-long tube sock, it can expand lengthwise (up to six inches) and widthwise (up to five inches) during sex or childbirth. Two vag no-nos? Douching and lotsa sugar, which can wipe out friendly bacteria and cause yeast overgrowth.</p><p><strong>2. Cervix</strong><br />The doorway between your uterus and vagina, this smooth, springy organ softens as estrogen surges. When you're knocked up, your cervix supports--quite literally--pregnancy, so keeping it strong is crucial. Compounds in the spice curcumin, as well as ellagic acid found in raspberries, walnuts, and pecans, can all stall cervical cancer. Smoking, on the other hand, is murder on your cervix.</p><p><strong>3. Uterus</strong><br />The fist-size, muscle-lined pouch makes a cozy home for your mini-me during pregnancy (it's also where menstrual cramps come from, ugh). Excess pounds and GI probs like constipation can put pressure on the uterus (not pleasant!), so stick to a healthy weight and eat ample fiber. Flavonoids in foods such as broccoli, cabbage, and peppers may help prevent uterine cancer.</p><p><strong>4. Ovaries</strong><br />Guys have testes; you have this almond-size twinset. At birth, your ovaries house around a million eggs, more than half of which are reabsorbed before puberty. Your ovaries work with what's left, unleashing up to 400 total ova over your lifetime. Keep them churning with beta carotene-rich foods (carrots, grapefruits) and green tea.</p><p><strong>5. Fallopian Tubes</strong><br />Lined with eyelash-like hairs, these eight- to 12-centimeter-long highways connect your ovaries and uterus. It's here that sperm and egg typically collide. Once fertilized, an embryo takes about six days to travel to the uterus. If, that is, your tubes are well oiled: Certain STI's can lead to blockages or infertility. Studies show acupuncture could help unclog things.</p><p><em>Privates Not Pictured:</em></p><p><strong>Vulva</strong><br />Your outer lady bits, including your clitoris and labia (otherwise known as your genital ""lips"").</p><p><strong>Urethra</strong><br />Also inside the vulva, this is your body's exit route for urine.</p><p><strong>More from <em>Women's Health</em>:</strong><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/vaginal-health"">Everything You Need to Know About Vaginas</a><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/vaginal-changes-with-age"">How Your Vagina Changes in Your 20s, 30s, and 40s</a><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/female-hormones"">5 Hormones That Mess With You Every Month</a></p>","need to know,November 2014,vaginas"

In fact, they long for their <a href=""/favorite_nodes/add/10389"">men in love</a> to kick it old-school by, say, opening the car door, picking up the dinner tab (at least in the early days of dating), and eventually, asking Dad's permission for their hand in marriage.<br /><br /><br /><br />If you're cringing right now, you're not alone. Even the women who crave these ultratraditional displays feel a little squeamish about it. ""Women work hard to be respected and taken seriously in so many areas of their lives, and some may feel as if they're betraying their 'strong female' identity by adopting old-fashioned romantic conventions in which the man is, in some ways, playing a dominant role,"" says Tara M. Emmers-Sommer, Ph.D., a professor of communication studies at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. So how does a modern girl reconcile these two disparate sides of herself? Read on.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Romantics at Heart</b><br /><br /><br />When your guy squashes a big, scary bug for you-or better, whisks you away for a secretly planned weekend-there's no shame in swooning just a little. ""No matter how powerful and independent they are, women still want to be pursued, protected, and cared for by their partners,"" says psychologist Diana Kirschner, Ph.D., author of <i>Love in 90 Days</i>.<br /><br /><br /><br />You can blame it, at least in part, on biology. ""Like all other animals, humans evolved to ensure healthy offspring. Millions of years ago, women wanted to mate with strong, resourceful, stable partners who could help provide for and protect their children,"" says Helen Fisher, Ph.D., a professor of anthropology at Rutgers University in New Jersey and author of <i>Why We Love</i>. ""And although it has been a long time since women have needed men to support them financially, the cues that indicate those same qualities are still innately attractive to women."" In other words, when he plans a date or helps you with a problem, it's powerful because, on some deep and perhaps unconscious level, it shows his ability to take charge and his staying power in the relationship.<br /><br /><br /><br />Plus, being wooed feels pretty damn great. It can boost your levels of feelgood dopamine-the neurotransmitter responsible for creating that romantic high-and the brain hormone oxytocin, which fosters feelings of attachment to a partner. Sweet gestures (bringing you a cup of coffee in bed, braving the cold to get the mail, driving you to the airport) can trigger that same lovey-dovey response, but a woman also tends to feel an increase in sexual desire when she perceives that her man is listening and taking care of her, says Kirschner.<br /><br /><br /><br />Biology aside, we can't ignore societal expectations, even in 2010. Emmers-Sommer conducted a recent study of 442 men and women between the ages of 18 and 49, and found that men are still largely the initiators when it comes to asking for a date, and that both sexes expect the man to always pay. ""It's social modeling: We're given these scripts about the male-female dynamic,"" she explains.<br /><br /><br /><br />Some of these notions of old-fashioned romance have been drilled into our heads since, well, our first Disney flick. As we get older, we're fed even more (and often traditional) relationship advice from our parents, along with being inundated by messages in ads, chick flicks, and reality TV.<br /><br /><br /><br />Think about it-the commercial where the man gives his wife a new diamond ring when they hit the five-year mark, the romcom in which the hero chases his true love through airport security and onto the plane, leaving his shoes and spare change behind. And on reality TV, people fall in love and propose after, oh, roughly five dates (which consist of helicopter rides and romps on tropical beaches). A study done by Robert H. Woods Jr., Ph.D., at Spring Arbor University, and Samuel Ebersole, Ph.D., at Colorado State University at Pueblo, found that 18-to 25-year-olds avidly watch <i>The Bachelor</i> and <i>The Bachelorette</i>-and many of them claim they watch this type of show to live vicariously through the characters.<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>The Paradox at Play</b><br /><br /><br />Considering that women are catching up with men, even outpacing them, in many fields (females make up the majority of students in colleges and universities, and roughly half in law and medical schools and business programs-and they now hold 37 percent of the management positions in the United States), it's a head-scratcher why we're so flummoxed when it comes to taking the romantic reins. Emmers-Sommer offers this explanation: ""Some women who are aggressive at the office may feel even <i>more</i> of a need to embrace their feminine side because they don't get to play that girlie role often. They're saying, 'OK, I'm this powerful woman, working hard and proving myself out there in the world, but peel that away, and I'm still a woman and I want to be treated like a classic lady in some respects.'""<br /><br /><br /><br />Another force that drives our desire for more and more romance is the influence of our social circles. ""There's this subconscious pressure that women really put on each other to have it all, so if a friend's husband romanced her with some grand gesture, you may want your guy to top that,"" says Kirschner. ""You see it a lot with marriage proposals and anniversary celebrations. Some women feel that the wow factor indicates the strength of the relationship to other people, and if it lacks that aspect, they worry their relationship isn't normal. So they strive for it more.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Meanwhile, all the technology designed to make our lives easier has redefined-and depersonalized-our courtship rituals, giving women even more of a hankering for old-fashioned romance. Dates are confirmed through e-mail and text messages; people let their mobiles buzz through dinner; and some even fall in love online...before they've met in person. ""Modern technology has many people yearning for 'real' traditional romance models, because they are not only more personal but also require effort,"" says Susan S. Hendrick, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at Texas Tech University.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Mixed Messages We Send to Men</b><br /><br /><br />These romantic paradoxes leave lots of men dumbfounded, unsure of whom they're dealing with or how to act: Does she want to be treated like the power player she seems to be, or the sappy romantic she may secretly be? Most women are a little bit of each, and our desires are ever changing depending on our moods and the circumstances (maybe some days you'd stomp that spider on your own, and other days you'd be hurt if your guy didn't reach for his wallet), so it can be a losing proposition for a man. ""Most men want to be respectful and treat females as equals, as partners, but they're often not sure how a strong, smart woman will react if he insists on paying the bill or holding the door open for her,"" says Pat Webster, Ph.D., coauthor of <i>Winning at Love</i>. ""While one woman might feel condescended to, another might crave this type of behavior and feel disappointed, even rejected, if he didn't extend these gestures.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Add to the confusion that many guys like to play the romantic hero. ""Men want to be able to step in and be more masculine whenever they can, especially in this economy,"" says Benjamin Karney, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the University of California at Los Angeles. And paying for dinner, fixing a broken door, and planning dates are ways they can feel like a source of strength for a woman. It's not that he wants to keep his little lady in her place but that he simply wants to make her happy and perhaps fulfill his own gender role as a knight in shining armor.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Today's Mating Dance</b><br /><br /><br />The question many women grapple with is, <i>Can I be strong and capable in life but still be a sucker for old-fashioned romance?</i> Absolutely. Says Webster: ""It doesn't mean that you're a weak or contradictory woman-you just have different needs. People aren't one-dimensional.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Even in our nonromantic lives, we transition between being more take-charge and more passive. ""That's the great thing about today's gender roles-they are fluid,"" says Hendrick. ""And in romance, men and women can dip in and out of roles depending on the situation and what they're most comfortable with.""<br /><br /><br /><br />The key is to make sure you and your guy clearly communicate your expectations, says Karney. For instance, some couples make a joint decision that most of the time they want to be equal partners and share the load, but on date nights and special occasions, he takes the lead. And at the end of the day, being a layered, multifaceted enigma is what being a woman is all about.<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p>",You and Improved

An hour before bedtime, have a small carb-based snack (e.g., a banana or a few multigrain crackers), advises Michael Murray, M.D., author of <em>The Encyclopedia of Healing Foods</em>. Carbs speed your body's release of tryptophan, which steps up your brain's production of snoozeinducing serotonin.</p><p><strong>Block out Artificial Light</strong><br />Biologically, we haven't yet learned to distinguish man-made from natural light, so any brightness kick-starts our wake cycles, says Herbert Yue, M.D., a physician at Stanford University's Sleep Disorders Clinic. After-hours illumination also disrupts the brain's nocturnal production of the sleep hormone melatonin. The tiny red light on the DVR won't keep you from dozing off, but the glow from your laptop may. Turn off your TV and computer 30 minutes before bed and, if nature calls during the night, don't flip the switch-the sudden burst of light will perk you up all over again.</p><p><strong>Make Your Bedroom Cool, but Wear Socks</strong><br />Researchers have found that as we prepare for sleep, our thermoregulation system diverts blood from our core to our extremities, a process that lowers body temperature. (The average person can go as low as 94 degrees between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m.) The reasons for this automatic cooldown aren't clear, but Yue says it's likely an evolutionary response designed to preserve energy for waking hours. Sleeping in a chilly room-68Â°F is optimal-will speed the process along so you can fall asleep faster. Also, put on a pair of socks; they'll help cause the blood vessels in your feet to expand, encouraging blood flow, which aids your body's cooling mechanism.</p><p><strong>Cut Back on Booze</strong><br />That second glass of Chardonnay might make you drowsy, but the grogginess won't last, says Yue. Alcohol fuels a neurotransmitter that helps you feel sleepy, but as the booze is metabolized, your ever-resilient brain works to rebound and cancel out its sedative effects. By the time your liver has processed the vino, your head has overcompensated, leaving you awake and restless</p>",

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/pregnancy-perks,Health,96,129,179,3,1,1,2,0,,Can You Be Addicted to Pregnancy?,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0907-pregnant-belly.jpg,"<p>It's not just in your head. There really is a bumper crop of baby bumps out there, from the famously fertile, like Heidi Klum, who's flirting with her fourth set of stretch marks in five years, to the infamous Nadya ""Octomom"" Suleman, who earlier this year bore eight babies at once even though she already had six other kids at home that she could barely afford to take care of. </p><p>In 2007 alone, American women birthed more than 4.3 million babies-the highest number ever. More than a quarter of those were to women having their third or fourth child, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And despite the <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/infertility-symptoms-and-basic-information"">infertility</a> freak-out the entire country seems to be currently engaged in, only a small number of these babies-perhaps 100,000-resulted from medical interventions such as in vitro fertilization, says Jamie Grifo, M. D., Ph. D., director of the division of reproductive endocrinology at the NYU School of Medicine. </p><p>That doesn't mean that we're transforming into a nation of Duggars (the Arkansas family with 18 kids often seen announcing their latest conception on NBC's <i>Today</i> show) and Novogratzes (the New York City clan of seven kids soon to be the focus of a new Bravo reality show)-the average number of children per American family is still hovering right around two. </p><p>Still, certain mothers, like 31-year-old Meagan Francis, who is raising her flock of five in Michigan, have big broods because that's what they're used to. ""I grew up in a relatively large family and always loved having lots of people around,"" she says. ""So it's natural that I'd try to re-create that experience with my own family."" </p><p>But it's not always quite so simple, <a href=""/health/the-top-doctors-in-america"">psychologists</a> say. Some women may like that pregancy feeling a little too much, often driven to rapidly reproduce out of insecurity, a craving for attention, or feelings of abandonment by their own parents. </p><p></p><p><b>The high of pregnancy</b><br />Having babies isn't addictive in the way that <a href=""/health/women-and-alcohol"">alcohol</a> and narcotics can be. But bumpaholics feel compelled to procreate for many of the same reasons that substance abusers turn to booze or drugs. </p><p>""Women who are obsessed with being pregnant are literally filling an emptiness inside of them, just as alcoholics and drug addicts use substances to fill a psychological void,"" says Beverly Hills psychiatrist Carole Lieberman, M. D. Every one of us at some point encounters this void, adds New York family therapist Bonnie Eaker Weil, Ph. D., author of <i>Financial Infidelity</i>. ""You want to have a purpose in this world. You want to feel less lonely."" </p><p>For some women, babies fill that gap perfectly. Infants are dependent creatures. They can give their mothers a clear identity; they can also become handy social buffers. At a party or on the playground, a woman struggling with feelings of social anxiety or self-consciousness can hide behind the adorable infant in her arms. Any pressure to be cute or charming or funny disappears- your baby has that covered. ""Bumpaholics breed to blot out their feelings of insecurity,"" Weil says. </p><p>Boston psychiatrist and Fox News consultant Keith Ablow, M. D., says some women seem to view having more children as an alternative to addressing their own personal problems. ""Bearing another child can sometimes provide a substitute for deciding on a career path, making a marriage work, or even wrestling with questions of self-worth,"" Ablow says. </p><p>And the baby fix can become a cycle. When an infant becomes a more independent toddler, ""the mom may feel abandoned and act quickly to fill the void again with a new baby who will rely upon her and her partner and define their lives,"" Lieberman says. </p><p>Procreating isn't just a psychological balm; it also feeds genuine physical cravings. According to Helen Fisher, Ph. D., a professor of anthropology at Rutgers University, humans developed a set of three related brain systems that are intended to push them toward parenthood: sex drive, hunger for the romantic love of one partner, and a desire for the calmness and security of attachment. </p><p>Mother Nature prods us by making sex and its aftermath feel amazing. Oxytocin, the so-called ""cuddle"" hormone that promotes bonding, floods women's bodies during intercourse, pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding. ""[The pregnancy feeling] is like a love drug,"" Weil says. ""A baby-love drug."" </p><p>Then there's the constant attention you garner from others when you're bursting with child. Bumpaholic or not, it can be pretty great. Barb Pomeroy, 42, of Longmont, Colorado, is a mother of six girls. She admits that she reveled in the questions and comments her pregnancies elicited from family, friends, and even complete strangers. She also loved the compliments people fed her about how good she looked when she was pregnant with her daughters. Even though she's not planning to have any more children, she misses the heightened interest and confidence pregnancy often brings. ""There's this feeling of being special when you're pregnant,"" she says. ""I feel like I become ordinary again when I'm not expecting."" </p><p>It's not hard to understand why: People smile at you, throw you baby showers, buy you lots of gifts. And the rounder your belly gets, the more space you take up in the world, and the more people take notice of you. In many respects, you become impossible to ignore. </p><p>Spouses and partners dote on you, gladly delivering soup at 10 a. m. or antacids at 11 p. m. ""My husband constantly rubbed and coddled me, and I ate it all up,"" says Liz Bustamante, a 39-year-old financial advisor from Forest Hills, New York, who has one child and is currently planning for the next. ""And for the first time in my life, instead of feeling insecure about my body, I wanted to run around naked! I'd never felt sexier."" </p><p>Magazines conduct celebrity-bump watches, and nude maternity portraits are becoming <i>de rigueur</i> for celebs and civilians alike. Pregnancy lets every woman be a star in her own world, and the rest of us are all too happy to shine the spotlight. A pregnant woman is exciting because the child she's carrying represents ""that tie to the future,"" says Holly Donahue Singh, a Ph. D. candidate in anthropology at the University of Virginia who teaches a class called Anthropology and Reproduction: Fertility and the Future. </p><p>The belly-rubbing high hits the pregnant woman as well as the people who surround her. The expectant mother gets an oxytocin blast and rubs her belly as a way of bonding. Admirers who rub her belly get a hormone rush, too. ""As social creatures, our brains have evolved to make positive social behaviors feel good. Touch causes the release of oxytocin, and this causes the release of dopamine in reward regions of the brain,"" says Paul J. Zak, director of the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies at Claremont Graduate University. </p><p>Given all the psychological, physical, and social rewards associated with pregnancy, it's no surprise that so many women like it. But plenty of couples stop at one or two children, despite the fundamental drive to reproduce. This is because we can use our higher brain functions to keep those instincts in check, reminding ourselves that children cost money-about $950 a month until they're 18-and require an extraordinary amount of time and energy. </p><p>This is precisely why the bump-loving Bustamante says she'll stop at two. Much as she loved her pregnant body and adores being a mom, she wants to allow for some financial flexibility-childcare, ballet lessons, summer camp, and college tuition add up.<br />Having sufficient funds isn't a deal-breaker for everyone, though. Nan Mooney, a 39-year-old single mom, is living with her parents in their Seattle home because she doesn't make enough money to support herself and her son. Still, she desperately wants more kids. Her friends and family call her crazy, she says, but ""I knew enough people growing up who had plenty of money who were not necessarily loved and not necessarily happy. I don't think it's an essential ingredient to raising well-adjusted children."" </p><p>Figuring out the right number of kids to have is a personal decision, to be sure. And not all women with lots of children are bumpaholics. But an important question for pregnancy-craving mothers to ask themselves is why they want more children, Weil says. Are you having them because you don't want to deal with your husband? Or so you don't have to go back to work? Or because you love the attention? Nadya Suleman, for one, is blunt about the fact that she got pregnant to fulfill an emotional need. As she reportedly told one journalist, ""I just longed for certain attachments with another person that I really lacked."" </p><p>But psychologists say there are far better ways of making meaningful connections. In order to have a healthy relationship, married moms need to spend quality time alone with their husbands-whether it's taking a vacation without the baby or just going out to dinner together once a week and leaving the kids with a sitter. ""Women who focus on their children to the exclusion of everything else inevitably face an emptiness when their kids grow up and become more independent,"" Weil says. </p><p>If you do find yourself feeling a void as your bundle of joy becomes a toddler, ""that's a good sign that it's time to look in the mirror and figure out what's going on with you,"" says Ann Pleshette Murphy, author of <i>The Seven Stages of Motherhood: Loving Your Life Without Losing Your Mind</i>. ""Invest in yourself. Though it may never be as satisfying as what we get from taking care of our kids, it's important to feel proud of something you do outside of child-rearing so that you don't think of yourself as 'only a mom.'"" </p><p>""Me time"" can include big things-like going back to work or starting your own business from home-or small, daily experiences that enrich your life, such as heading to the gym or joining your girlfriends for dinner and cocktails. It's only when you have a balanced life that you can be sure the inner call for a new addition to your family should be answered.<br /><br /><a href=""/life/pregnancy-addiction""><b><br />Tell us, have you, or anyone you know, been addicted to the perks of pregnancy?

It had been a long day of meetings, and she'd been looking forward to a glass of sauvignon blanc since lunch.<p></p><p>As Sara approached Ben that night, she felt giddy-almost as if she'd already pounded the glass of wine she hadn't yet ordered. She didn't know it, but by the time Ben pulled out the barstool next to his, invited her to sit down, and asked what she'd like to drink, the area of Sara's brain that houses her dopamine receptors (a.k.a. ""the pleasure center"") was lit up like the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center. A neurochemical rush of dopamine, phenylethylamine, and oxytocin flooded her body, and she instantly felt excited. Eager. Spontaneous. Sara sidled up to the bar and was quickly engaged in that familiar flirty backand- forth with Ben that always gave her a boost.</p><p>Did Sara cheat on her husband of 10 years with her cute coworker? Keep reading. But judging from the most consistent data on <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/open-relationship"">infidelity among married couples</a> (which comes from the General Social Survey, based at the University of Chicago and sponsored by a grant from the National Science Foundation), most people don't end up knocking boots with someone other than their betrothed: In 2006, just 15 percent of married women and 20 percent of married men admitted to <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/jealously-relationship"">cheating</a> on their spouses.</p><p>However, women appear to be closing the infidelity gap: In 1991, 10 percent of women and 21 percent of men reported being unfaithful. And researchers speculate that the actual number of people who cheat is always higher than what's reported.</p><p>Of course, it doesn't take a bunch of numbers to clue us in to what's playing out all around us. For starters, there's the pileup of high-profile trysts that have made headlines in the past year-Tiger Woods, Jesse James, David Boreanaz, and John Edwards, to name but a few. Then there's your friend (or maybe it's you) who's gotten dangerously close to the edge-or slipped over it-with that former high school hottie who popped up on Facebook. Our culture seems almost steeped in infidelity, so much so that a jeweler recently ran ads in major magazines showing an engagement ring with this tag on it: ""Virtually eliminates cheating, since you'll never want to take it off."" It's enough to make one wonder: Have we reached the point where staying true to our partner is more pipe dream than practical?<br /><br /><strong>Wired to stray</strong><br />Whether or not Sara, or any of us, crosses the line from flirty exchanges to infidelity might come down to what's in our DNA, according to a recent discovery by scientists at the University of Texas at Austin.<br /><br />In a study of women between the ages of 17 and 30, those with higher levels of estradiol (an ovarian hormone that gives a woman the physical characteristics most desired by men-think high cheek bones, symmetrical facial features, and an hourglass figure) were more likely to flirt, kiss, and have a serious affair with someone other than their primary partner than were those with lower levels of this reproductive hormone.</p><p>""For women who have more estradiol, their brains essentially tell them, 'You're a hot commodity: Your fertility is high, you can get the best-looking guy with the best resources, so go for it,' "" says Kristina Durante, Ph.D., a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Minnesota and coauthor of the study. ""It's not that a high level of this hormone makes a woman sleep around, but it may unconsciously inspire her to keep her options open and trade up for a better partner if one comes along- particularly if she's not satisfied with her current partner.""</p><p>Of course, biology is only one part of the equation; not all women who cheat have more estradiol pumping through their bodies. Wendy, a 35-year-old college professor in New York City who describes herself as ""wiry,"" lacks those highly desirable female traits that point to higher levels of the hormone. And yet, when boredom set in with her live-in boyfriend, she started sleeping with her ex-lover. ""Having sex with my ex behind my current boyfriend's back was an escape from the mundane home life that I was living,"" she says. ""Plus, the sex I had with my boyfriend wasn't always the best-but it was hot with my ex.""</p><p>More research tells us, though, that biology can also contribute to that kind of dissatisfaction with a husband or boyfriend and lead any woman to stray, regardless of her estradiol levels-specifically, how we think our partner smells. You've probably heard about the research showing that the more you like a guy's natural scent, the more dissimilar your genetic makeup is likely to be, and the more sexually attracted you'll be to him because of the high chance that you'll make healthy, good-looking babies. Well, scientists at the University of New Mexico wanted to know if partners' genetic similarity had anything to do with their sexual satisfaction too. So they studied 48 heterosexual couples who had been together for at least two years, quizzing them about their sexual histories and testing them for genetic compatibility. Sure enough, the more similar a woman's genetic makeup was to her partner's, the less she seemed to enjoy having sex with him and the more likely she was to report having had affairs.</p><p>Other studies show that some men also have more of a physiological propensity than others to pull a Tiger. Swedish researchers found that the fewer receptors for vasopressin (a neurotransmitter associated with feelings of attachment and a need to protect a partner) a man has in his brain, the more likely he is to seek sexual variety and to be disloyal. In addition, the more testosterone a male receives in utero, the higher his likelihood of infidelity, says psychiatrist Daniel G. Amen, M.D., a brain-imaging specialist and the author of <i>Change Your Brain, Change Your Body</i>. (Here's a clue: If your dude got a hefty dose of the hormone before he was born, his ring finger is likely longer than his pointer finger, says Amen. Go ahead-put down the magazine and check out your guy's hand. We'll wait.)</p><p>So far, these biological markers for infidelity in both women and men are out of a person's control. After all, there's no pill (yet!) that can lower estradiol levels in a woman or pump more vasopressin into a man. But there is a physiological cause of infidelity that Amen says we are controlling-though we don't realize it: Thanks to our fast-paced, get-it-when-you-want-it lifestyle (e.g., instant information via a smartphone, the continuous wonder of what e-mail might await, a DVR that lets you fast-forward through commercials), we're overworking the pleasure centers in our brains. The result? It's taking more and more to satisfy us, including our sexual appetites.</p><p>""To some extent, our overstimulation-the high we get from the ding signaling a new text message or the immediate access we have to online information- is hijacking the pleasure systems in our brains and robbing us of our ability to experience pleasure in simple things,"" says clinical psychologist Archibald D. Hart, Ph.D., author of <i>Thrilled to Death: How the Endless Pursuit of Pleasure Is Leaving Us Numb</i>. And if G-rated stimuli like e-mail and text messages are wearing out our pleasure centers, imagine what the availability of all the X-rated content is doing to us.</p><p>Izzy, a 31-year-old teacher in Syracuse, New York, says she believes this is at the heart of why her (now ex) boyfriend cheated on her. ""Pornography is so accessible,"" she says. ""If my boyfriend hadn't had the instant gratification of pictures and videos-if he let all that sexual energy build up until he saw me at the end of the day instead-I think he would have been more satisfied with having sex with me and less likely to pursue affairs. Because of all that porn, he constantly had sex on the brain, and I think our lovemaking couldn't compare to what he was seeing on the screen."" When she didn't meet those needs, it upped the ante: ""He figured he'd get his needs fulfilled by other people.""</p><p><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/relationships-and-sex-cheating-spouses"">Tell us: Have you ever cheated?</a></p><p><strong>Access Infidelity</strong><br />Back to Sara and Ben: Whether or not there's more estradiol pumping through Sara's body (and there may be, considering she is remarkably pretty and has a great body) or fewer receptors for vasopressin in Ben's brain (perhaps so-Sara suspects he's had many sex partners), one thing is clear: As they sat in that bar, what was physiologically happening in both of their bodies prompted them to take their usual flirting up a notch. Ben told Sara how hot he always thinks she looks when she pulls her hair up and keeps it in place with a pencil; Sara admitted to him she has thought about having sex with him in her office after hours.<br /><br />When Ben excused himself to go to the men's room, his hand grazed Sara's forearm. Thanks to the cocktail of neurochemicals floating around in her body, her skin was more sensitive to the touch, so that brush of Ben's fingers sent a tingling sensation all over. She started to fantasize about kissing him. Going back to his room. Letting him rip off her clothes. She felt more impulsive than usual. She stopped thinking about her husband at home watching TV on the couch with their daughter sound asleep down the hall.</p><p>The reason Sara was in this prime position to make her fantasies about Ben become reality is that, like most women her age, she works outside the home. ""It used to be that a woman's only career path was to marry,"" says Helen Fisher, an anthropologist at Rutgers University and the author of <i>Why Him? Why Her?</i> ""If her husband had a mistress, the woman would have to look the other way or risk losing all the resources she needed to survive. Now women have more economic power, and with that comes sexual freedom.""</p><p>Fueling our sexual freedom is our ability to pursue a fling without even opening the front door; we can simply open a laptop.</p><p>""Clearly, technology has an effect on the number of women cheating,"" says Tara Parker-Pope, a <i>New York Times</i> science reporter and the author of <i>For Better: The Science of a Good Marriage</i>. ""It has created more opportunity. Once you create more opportunity, people are at greater risk for infidelity."" In addition to e-mail and Facebook, there are Craigslist's casual encounters, ChatRoulette.com, and even websites like AshleyMadison.com, an online service for married people looking to cheat (its tagline: ""Life is short. Have an affair.""). Opportunity is no longer just around the next corner-now it's literally at our fingertips.<br /><br /><strong>(Too) Great Expectations</strong><br />There has to be more than just the ability to have an affair, though, that makes it appealing. After all, as the research on estradiol uncovered, even women with the greatest genetic propensity to cheat seem to do so only if they are dissatisfied with their partners. So why, then, are greater numbers of young women dissatisfied enough to flirt with an old flame on Facebook or to decide to go back to a coworker's hotel room during a business trip?<br /><br />Brad Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, blames the evolution of what he calls ""soul-mate marriage,"" where each partner enters the union with expectations that don't stand a chance of being met. Stephanie Coontz, author of <i>Marriage, A History</i>, agrees. ""Today, we think of marriage as a blissful union in which our partner should meet all of our physical and emotional needs,"" she says. ""When that doesn't happen, it creates more of a reason for one or both partners to look for other people."" The idea of soul mates is an overly romantic approach to love, setting us up for failure when our partner doesn't meet our sky-high expectations.</p><p>""Research shows that infidelity is more common among couples who lived together before getting married, and I think that's because cohabitation is often used as a chance to test-drive the relationship,"" says Wilcox. ""You say to yourself, If this doesn't work out, I'll keep looking. That mentality can persist even after you're married, which makes it more likely for one or both partners to bail on the relationship rather than work on it when problems arise.""</p><p><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/relationships-and-sex-cheating-spouses"">Tell us: Have you ever cheated?</a></p><p><strong>To Cheat or Not to Cheat</strong><br />In the elevator on her way up to Ben's room, Sara had a quick flash of what the consequences of this choice could be and considered stopping the steamy encounter immediately. But in the next instant, Ben's hands were on the small of her back, and he pulled her closer to him, kissing her gently at first and then with more intensity. Sara couldn't resist then-mostly because she was so turned on. Much more so than when she was with her husband.<br /><br />That's because when you're with a new partner, the neurochemicals that surge through your body (for both men and women) are much stronger than those released when you're with a long-term lover, says clinical psychologist David J. Ley, Ph.D., author of <i>Insatiable Wives: Women Who Stray and the Men Who Love Them</i>. ""As a result of the higher levels of neurochemicals, a new lover's caress is often way more stimulating than your spouse's,"" he says.</p><p>Ley notes that another factor at play in Sara's overwhelmingly strong attraction to Ben was an additional change happening in his body. For men, the prospect of sex with a new partner creates a physiological response that doesn't happen before sleeping with a familiar partner: Neurochemicals in their semen (predominantly testosterone and prostaglandin) rise higher, producing more semen and an ability to have longer, more vigorous sex. Did Sara know this? No, says Ley-but, he adds, we unconsciously pick up on the complex interplay of chemicals happening in each other's bodies.</p><p>The heightened hormone levels were not only igniting Ben's and Sara's sex drives but also inspiring Sara to feel sexy and irresistible-which isn't exactly how she thinks of herself when she's making a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich before bed for her daughter's next-day lunch or nagging her husband to mow the lawn. ""For many women, when they're in a situation in which they're desired, it's a real contrast to the feelings they usually have about themselves and how attractive they feel,"" says Ley.<br /><br /><strong>The Drive to Be Desirable</strong><br />Even when women are in a circumstance where they could sleep with someone else but choose not to, they almost always report that the experience boosted their self-esteem and helped them remember that other people find them attractive, says Ley.<br /><br />And that's what some women are really after: a reminder that they've still got it going on. In other cases-including Sara's-infidelity can be the result of a marriage that's just not working.</p><p>Why, considering the grief Sara suspected would come of it, did she still walk into Ben's hotel room and let him seduce her onto the king-size bed? For starters, she was convinced that her marriage- which had been on the rocks for about a year-was doomed. ""If 50 percent of us get divorced, I figured that I was just destined to be among the unlucky half,"" says Sara. (And indeed, about a year after that hotel encounter with Ben, she decided to call it quits on her marriage.) But Parker-Pope thinks this is part of today's infidelity problem: The often-repeated ""50 percent divorce rate"" statistic is overstated.</p><p>Parker-Pope says she had the same thought Sara did while going through her own marital split. Why should I expect to be part of the lucky half that doesn't get divorce
? she remembers wondering. But after poring over the research (unfortunately, once her own divorce was final), Parker-Pope discovered that among people who got married in the 1990s, only 22 percent of them were divorced within the first 10 years of marriage. But that 50 percent stat had made her feel as if divorce were probably inevitable.</p><p>""I wish someone had told me how uncommon it is to get divorced and that it's much more common to make marriage work,"" says Parker-Pope. And she's convinced that the same undeserved perception of skyrocketing infidelity is also driving our actions.</p><p>This was certainly true for Wendy, the New York City professor who had a fling with her ex. She acknowledges that part of what made her cheat was the feeling that everyone does it, and she didn't want to be the only one not invited to that party.

Scientists say each of us is born with our own personal happiness set point.</p><p>Some may register at a seven on a scale of one to 10 (cheerful most of the time), others at a four (often moody). But no matter where you fall, there are ways to bump up your happiness level. Here's how to boost your set point:</p><p><strong>Have an attitude of gratitude.</strong> Take a few minutes out of your day to think about everything that has happened recently to make you smile. Yeah, it sounds a bit self-helpy, but according to Lyubomirsky, it works: ""When you have to keep coming up with answers to the question 'What am I thankful for?' it forces you to see how the little things you might have overlooked or taken for granted play a role in your happiness.""</p><p><strong>Banish the comparisons.</strong> Happy people take pleasure in the successes of other people rather than using those successes as a yardstick to measure their own lives. ""You can't feel good about what you have if you're constantly calculating how you stack up to others,"" says Lyubomirsky. The irony is that in order to become less competitive (and a lot happier), you need to drop out of the race. That's not to say you should abandon your goals-it just means you need to start running at your own pace.</p><p><strong>Find meaning in your work.</strong> A study of a hospital's cleaning staff found that those who described their jobs as bettering the lives of others were more satisfied than those who considered their jobs less worthwhile. Experts also say that those of us who believe we're doing what we're destined to do feel more immediate and long-term happiness. Even if you're not jazzed about your current job, consider how your actions contribute to the common good. Or relish how it gives you the means to participate in pleasurable activities outside of work.</p><p><strong>Hang with happy people.</strong> A study done by the University of California at San Diego and Harvard Medical School revealed that ""happiness can spread from person to person to person in a chain reaction, through social circles."" On average, every happy friend you have increases your chance of being happy by 9 percent. Now if happiness is contagious, don't you want to put yourself in a position to catch it?</p>",

If you find yourself succumbing to ridiculously jealous thoughts, try these steps to calm yourself down. </p><p><strong>1. Don't compare yourself to his exes.</strong> Yes, he dated a Hooters girl in college, a gothic girl in high school, and-most recently-a lawyer...you are the one he wants. If you constantly compare yourself to them, you're only setting yourself up for crazy behavior.</p><p><strong>2. Communicate your insecurities with him.</strong> Maybe you've been cheated on before, and you have trust issues, which cause jealously...he needs to know about that. Just know that if you lay it all out on the table, you need to really be willing to work on your jealously issues.</p><p><strong>3. Don't snoop around.</strong> Do not go through his phone, e-mails, computer history, etc. If you honestly don't trust your significant other THAT much, there are bigger issues at bay.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/workout-motivation-0,Fitness,213,120,90,13,1,0,6,0,,Revive Your Resolutions,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/revive-resolutions-art.jpg,"<p>The iconic Times Square globe wasn't the only ball to get dropped in early 2011. Of the 120 million Americans who rang in the New Year with a resolution, 36 percent ditched their vows by February. Chilly temps, dreary days, and a wardrobe full of parkas and sweats can make a Snuggie seem more alluring than a spin class.</p><p>But it's possible to rebound. Researchers found that 71 percent of people who eventually met their goals said an initial slipup made them all the more determined to get back on track.</p><p>And thanks to this season's mild weather and long daylight hours, it's the perfect time to renew your slim-down vows. Now, for that kick in the pants...</p><p><strong>Resolution: Hit the gym every day.</strong></p><p><strong>The problem:</strong> Aiming to do anything every day, besides eat and breathe, is setting yourself up for failure.</p><p><strong>The fix:</strong> Commit to a more realistic schedule of four days a week, says Bonnie Pfiester, co-owner of BCx Boot Camp in Vero Beach, Florida. That gives you three days of wiggle room (for late work nights or Saturday-morning hangovers), but you have to consider the four workout days nonnegotiable.</p><p>""You likely failed the first time around because you saw workouts as optional,"" says Pfiester. ""If you schedule them like business meetings or lunch dates, you'll be more likely to follow through."" Create a specific action plan (e.g., Monday, 7 p.m.: spin class; Wednesday, 6 a.m.: circuit workout plus 20 minutes of cardio intervals; Thursday, 6 p.m.: 30-minute power walk before dinner; Friday, 7 a.m.: vinyasa yoga class). Then put it on your calendar.</p><p><strong>Resolution: Weight train more often.</strong></p><p><strong>The problem:</strong> You can't tear your cardio-obsessed butt off the elliptical.</p><p><strong>The fix:</strong> Think 30 minutes of lunges and pushups can't match an hour on the stair-climber? Think again. Circuit strength training (doing exercises without resting in between) challenges your muscles more than a lollygagging cardio workout, says Jen Cohen, official trainer for CW's Shedding for the Wedding. Plus, there's a bonus after-burn effect: A 2010 study found that people who did a strength-training circuit blazed an extra 100 calories per day for the next three days. The best part? The quick bursts of effort keep your heart rate up, giving you that cardio buzz you crave. Most gyms offer classes with this philosophy, but you can also find at-home versions at WomensHealthMag.com.</p><p><strong>Resolution: Work out in the a.m.</strong></p><p><strong>The problem:</strong> You hit the snooze button the way the Real Housewives hit the chardonnay--hard and often.</p><p><strong>The fix:</strong> Morning workouts aren't for everyone--and they don't need to be.</p><p>In fact, late afternoon is when muscle strength and alertness peak, so it's a great time to power through a routine. But if sunrise is the only time you can fit in exercise, buddy up. ""Knowing someone will be knocking at your door or meeting you at the gym helps you fight the temptation to sleep in,"" says Pfiester. And as your jeans start sliding on more easily, you'll be more driven to stick to the schedule--with or without a pal. No one willing to tag along with you at the crack of dawn? Hire a trainer, join a boot-camp class, or log on to an online community. They all utilize the accountability concept--plus shelling out cash provides a financial incentive to show up.</p><p><strong>Resolution: Drop 10 to 20 pounds.</strong></p><p><strong>The problem:</strong> You lost a few fast, then stalled and slipped back into old habits.</p><p><strong>The fix:</strong> Expecting to lose weight without a plan of action isn't a New Year's resolution, it's a fantasy, says John Norcross, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania. It's critical not only to say what you want to do but also to figure out how you'll achieve it. Instead of vowing to shed a large amount of weight and then winging it, decide to lose a pound a week by, say, packing your lunch and going to the gym four days a week. Monitoring new behavior is empowering, says Norcross, so break it down by charting your weekly exercise minutes or daily veggie servings.</p><p><strong>Resolution: Run a marathon.</strong></p><p><strong>The problem:</strong> The distance intimidated you, or the training burned you out.</p><p><strong>The fix:</strong> Go slow. The distance (26.2 miles) is daunting for anyone, especially a newbie. And if that didn't deter you, a too-eager training plan may have.</p><p>New to the racing scene? Consider all of your options. ""It doesn't have to be marathon or bust,"" says Jake Havenar, Ph.D., a running coach in Mountain View, California. First try a 5-K, then build up to a 10-K or half marathon.</p><p>""Gradually increasing your distance boosts your chance of success, which builds self-confidence."" And people with confidence are more likely to reach their goals, says Norcross.</p><p>If you still have the marathon itch, consider this: More than 140 U.S. marathons will take place this fall, and because most training schedules are 16 weeks long, June (not January!) is an ideal time to get started.</p><p> </p>",

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/benefits-of-shopping,Life,121,118,44,19,0,6,0,0,,Shopping IS Good For You: How Manolos Can Save Your Life,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0812-how-manolos.jpg,"<p>Do me a favor and hide this article from my wife. </p><p>It's the holiday season, and that means she'll soon drag me along on her annual descent into that pit of despair known as our local mall to enact the time-honored tradition of millions of couples: She'll gleefully embark on a marathon of <a href=""/life/bargaining-skills"">browsing and buying</a>, and I'll trail miserably behind her, wondering whether I should fake a heart attack to make it all stop.</p><p>Unfortunately for me and all other non-<a href=""/life/metrosexuals"">metrosexual males</a>, a new discovery could help you justify browsing for hours on end. Studies show that shopping isn't just about materialism and torturing the man in your life; it's actually good for your mental and physical health. It releases mood-lifting endorphins, boosts your immune system, keeps your brain nimble, and even fulfills basic social needs. And I'm sure that's exactly what my wife has in mind when she makes me spend two hours looking at sweaters at the Gap.</p><p><b>Can't buy me love?</b><br />There already is a well-established link between <a href=""/life/high-tech-for-half-the-price"">shopping</a> and a heightened sense of happiness. Maybe flipping through the racks at Macy's isn't quite as strenuous as 60 minutes on the treadmill or as fun as a romp in the sack with your significant other, but assuming you enjoy it, shopping will give you the same kind of high by releasing a flood of endorphins--the feel-good chemicals in your brain, says Nancy Irwin, Psy.D., a Los Angeles-based psychotherapist. ""Shopping can be extremely thrilling,"" Irwin says. ""It's a peak experience to get a hell of a deal.""</p><p>Academics who have measured shopping's effect on the brain tend to agree. In a paper published last year, researchers at the UK's Brunel University noted that shopping is associated with increased activity in the left prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain that has been linked to pleasure and positive thinking. In fact, levels of dopamine, a neurotransmitter released during pleasurable experiences including sex, can rise sharply even when you're merely window shopping. In another study, published in the journal Neuron, researchers at MIT, Carnegie Mellon, and Stanford strapped volunteers to an fMRI machine and showed them photos of products. When shoppers saw something they wanted to buy, a flood of dopamine to the nucleus accumbens--the brain's reward center--lit up their fMRI images like a dashboard. (The downside: When the charge for those Frye boots shows up on your credit-card statement, that dopamine is nowhere to be found. Sneaky.) </p><p>Luckily--for your brain, not your bank account--science has discovered a way to sidestep buyer's remorse: Imagine yourself enjoying your purchase a decade from now. Anat Keinan, an assistant professor at the Harvard Business School, and Ran Kivetz, a professor of marketing at Columbia Business School, gave 57 shoppers a hypothetical scenario: Choose between an expensive article of clothing they loved and a cheaper, less desirable version of the same thing. Then the researchers randomly divided the shoppers into two groups and asked one group to guess how much they thought they would regret their choice the next day and the other group how much they thought they would regret their choice in 10 years. Shoppers in the 10-year group were much more likely to be disappointed that they'd chosen a cost-cutting option; when they were later turned loose in an actual mall, they were more likely to purchase expensive, nonessential items. In their findings, published in the December 2008 issue of the Journal of Marketing Research, Keinan and Kivetz concluded that thinking about short-term regret drives consumers to be virtuous, while thinking about long-term regret leads them to be extravagant. </p><p>Whether that information makes you fear for your financial ruin or lunge for your American Express gold card, Paul Zak, Ph.D., director of the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies at Claremont Graduate University, is sure about one thing: Shopping is good for all humanity. Take a typical exchange between sales-person and customer: When you buy a dress, you're psyched because you have a new outfit. But the saleswoman is psyched too, because she just scored a commission. You help her, and she helps you. The positive effects continue to pile up, often unintentionally, even after your purchase. Thanks to your newly elevated mood, you might smile at a stranger on the bus, or offer to make dinner for your guy when you get home, passing along residual happiness. Everybody wins.</p><p>And it's not only about pleasure. Shopping may also help women maintain their mental acuity in old age, says Guy McKhann, M.D., a professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University and a co-author of Keep Your Brain Young. ""People who are doing really well as they get older tend to be mentally engaged, physically active, and socially involved,"" he says. ""And women are all of those things when they shop."" Meanwhile, back on the couch, Grandpa scores none of the above.</p><p><b>Coed browsing</b><br />So if shopping is so good for you, why does it make me and every other guy I know want to curl up next to the checkout counter and die? Not surprisingly, shopping can affect men and women differently, say S. Christian Wheeler, Ph.D., of Stanford University, and Jonah Berger, Ph.D., of the University of Pennsylvania. In a study published in the Journal of Consumer Research, the two marketing professors asked men and women to think about clothes shopping and then plot a trip on a map. Men tended to map the most direct driving route possible (as in ""Get me the hell out of here, pronto""). Women were more likely to take the scenic route. The scientists' explanation: Many men tend to shop for specific items and only when they are needed, whereas women generally browse to see what's out there. (Interestingly, when subjects weren't asked to think about shopping beforehand, the researchers found the opposite trend: Women went direct, while men meandered.) </p><p>That doesn't mean that shopping is any less beneficial for men, says Lester Lefton, Ph.D., a professor of experimental psychology at Kent State University. (He happens to be the university's president, which means he also presides over KSU's School of Fashion Design and Merchandising.) It's not shopping per se that men dislike--it's shopping for things that hold no interest for them, says Lefton, who admits that he has been buying the same shoes (size 12EEE Byrons from Allen-Edmonds) for more than 30 years. But bring him into a nicely stocked hardware or electronics store and he can shop for hours while his wife slowly slips into a coma. </p><p>The solution for couples who dread shopping together isn't very complicated, Lefton says. Just ditch the idea that you have to stay side-by-side as you browse. ""I've been married for 39 years. When my wife and I go to the mall, we split up. I don't have to go shoe shopping, and she doesn't have to come to the Apple store. We meet up for lunch."" As long as you're both looking for stuff you love, coed shopping excursions will help keep you--and your relationship--going strong. </p><p><b>Less is more</b><br />Want to enjoy your holiday shopping? Skip the big chains.<br />--Naomi Piercey</p><p>Dodging elbows at a department store or, God forbid, a discount outlet at this time of year is anything but stress-relieving. But it's not just the relentless crowds, sparse parking, and cheesy holiday music. If you ask psychologist Barry Schwartz, Ph.D., author of The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less, it's all about options: We have too many.</p><p><b>Being picky doesn't pay</b></p><p>""When people have too much to choose from, they will be less satisfied with their choices,"" Schwartz says. ""It's easy to think about the opportunities they rejected."" Researchers have dubbed those people ""maximizers."" They've found that it's really the ""satisficers""--those who aim for just good enough--who are happiest with their purchases.</p><p><b>Save your brainwaves</b></p><p>Indecisiveness strains the brain, says economist Paul Zak, Ph.D., of Claremont Graduate University: ""You have a limited amount of mental energy, and your brain wants to conserve it.""

Most of the language out there is super earnest or mind-bogglingly clinical-or it was before Yael Cohen opened her mouth.</p><p>""Cancer was the 'C word' to our grandparents' generation, and we've held on to some of that social discomfort,"" Yael, 25, says. ""But it's not a controversial issue like porn or abortion; it's a reality-one we haven't been taught to talk about."" Case in point: Three years ago, when Yael told people about her mother's then-recent breast-cancer diagnosis, she was met with plenty of unease-and lots of hushed replies.</p><p>While helping her mom through treatment, Yael decided to speak up. Loudly. She started <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/fuck-cancer"">Fuck Cancer</a>, a ballsy, straight-talking nonprofit organization with an explicit mission: Teach people how to look for cancer in themselves and others. Here are Yael's frank thoughts on how to spread the word.</p><p><strong>Feel free to drop the F-bomb.</strong><br />Just like the word cancer, a profanity may be something you think about but are hesitant to voice. Don't be bashful: Cursing cancer out loud can help you feel brave and get other people talking about prevention, says Yael.</p><p><strong>Throw a shower party.</strong><br />Yael once designed cheeky invitations to a shower bash-as in, the bathroom shower, where it's often recommended women check their breasts. ""None of us actually showered together,"" she says, laughing, ""but it was a great way to remind people in a nonscary way to do a breast self-exam.""</p><p><strong>Get the guys involved.</strong><br />Let the breast-obsessed men in your life know they have a new job: to pay extra close attention to their S.O.'s chests, and to speak up the second something feels or looks different, says Yael.</p><p><strong>Be real with your parents.</strong><br />Remember that sex talk they stumbled through with you? It's your turn. Urging your folks to get screened for cancer is worth it; lifesavingly worth it. If they brush you off, Yael says, you can employ the good-old guilt trip: ""If you can't do it for yourself, do it for me.""</p><p><strong>Owe it to yourself.</strong><br />""You might not develop cancer. Your kids might not. But someone you love or know probably will,"" says Yael. ""It's your responsibility to yourself and others to talk about it. The more we talk, the more we'll know about catching it early.""</p><p></p><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/fuck-cancer/images/warriors/Krupali-Tejura.jpg"" /><br /><br /><strong>THE AFFECTIONATE PHYSICIAN<br /><em>Krupali Tejura, M.D., is a radiation oncologist and blogger</em></strong><p></p><p>Your friend tells you that she has bad news. You freeze up and say, ""I don't know what to say."" Understandable, but not the most helpful. Fact is, research shows breast-cancer patients who get loads of emotional support tend to fare better in the long run. Just ask Krupali Tejura, M.D., a cancer doctor who knows all about bedside manner. She's not shy about hand-holding or using social media to give her patients something to smile about (she often tweets out their wish lists-tickets to the Ellen show; a powwow with a famous musician-mobilizing her followers to pitch in). Take a cue from Krupali and hone your own bedside manner by learning what to say to someone who's dealing with cancer.</p><p><strong>DO</strong> say, ""Let me know what I can do."" But follow up with specific suggestions: ""Can I give you a ride to the doctor? Can I pick up your dry cleaning? Can I do your grocery shopping this week?"" Krupali says that ""concrete examples are better than vague offers. People going through cancer can't always quickly think of stuff you can help with.""</p><p><strong>DO</strong> say, ""I'm thinking of you."" Then prove it. Send her a care package or remember to call and check in every week.</p><p><strong>DO</strong> keep in mind who you're talking to. Blanket statements such as ""I know you're strong enough to handle this"" could be interpreted as supportive or helpful by some and as bullying or dismissive by others.</p><p><strong>DO</strong> lend your words to strangers. Krupali recently tweeted that she was saddened by the fact that one of her patients was fighting colon cancer alone. A week later, Krupali received an unsolicited handmade get-well card from a family across the country. ""My patient was in the ICU,"" she says. ""I brought him the card, and he had tears in his eyes. He was so grateful that someone cared.""</p><p><strong>DON'T</strong> go on and on. Cancer patients are still people, and like all people, they get tired of talking about the same thing all the time. Krupali makes a point of reviewing the news or swapping pop-culture gossip with her patients to help them retain a sense of normalcy.</p><p><strong>DON'T</strong> speak like you know better: ""Why aren't you getting chemo? My aunt did and is totally fine now."" ""Every patient and every cancer is different,"" says Krupali. ""Leave the treatment to the doctors and respect your friend's choices without judging her decisions."" If you just can't keep mum, try something more constructive, like, ""Do you need help getting a second opinion?""</p><p><strong>DON'T</strong> be afraid of silence. ""Sometimes less is more, even verbally,"" says Krupali. ""You don't have to move mountains to show that you care."" Taking the time to sit with your pal can often be enough.</p><p><strong>DON'T</strong> apologize profusely or beat yourself up if ""I don't know what to say"" slips out of your mouth. ""You may sometimes say things that the other person doesn't appreciate,"" says Krupali. ""That's OK. There's no one perfect response.""</p><p></p><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/fuck-cancer/images/warriors/Florence-Williams.jpg"" /><br /><br /><strong>THE BREAST INVESTIGATOR<br /><em>Florence Williams is the author of the book Breasts: A Natural and Unnatural History</em></strong><p></p><p>Florence Williams knows a thing or two about boobs (they don't officially stop growing until you get pregnant; guys may prefer smaller ta-tas after all). She also knows that you should protect your chest without driving yourself nuts. Behold, some of her fascinating findings:</p><p><strong>Just how complex are breasts?</strong><br />So complex. I like to say they almost always have antennae out so they can feed the body information. They are like sponges; they seem to absorb things quickly, including toxins. In fact, I had my breast milk tested and it came back positive for flame retardants, pesticides, and ingredients found in jet fuel.</p><p><strong>Whoa. How could that be?</strong><br />The science isn't clear, but it may be because breasts are very fatty and a lot of industrial chemicals are attracted to fat. Unfortunately, many chemicals can also mimic the female hormone estrogen, high levels of which have been linked to breast cancer.</p><p><strong>How can you cut out chemicals?</strong><br />The truth is you can't totally control your exposure. I make an effort, but I don't want to make myself crazy. What we really need is better science and government involvement. The best thing you can do for your breasts is encourage more research into prevention. Write letters to your elected officials; get involved by volunteering for a group like the Silent Spring Institute or Breast Cancer Action.</p><p><strong>Great idea. Day-to-day prevention advice?</strong><br />I think it makes sense for women to avoid exposure to gasoline by-products. When you're pumping gas, stand a few feet away from the pump. And don't walk or jog next to a highway. It also makes sense to try to avoid flame retardants, which are often used in furniture. Do your research, and read labels before buying. Look for a ""green"" cleaner to dry-clean your clothes.</p><p><strong>What about BPA?</strong><br />In animal studies, BPA, a chemical often found in plastics and canned food, appears to alter mammary glands in ways that can lead to cancer. We don't know for sure that it causes human tumors, but I would take a moderated approach. Buy BPA-free canned food and bottles. Personally, I never take a store receipt-they're often covered in BPA.</p><p><strong>Any other tips?</strong><br />Do what seems comfortable and manageable: Try eating more fresh and less canned food, avoid cigarette smoke, and drink lightly. These things are great for you beyond breast health, so you get big rewards.</p><p></p><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/fuck-cancer/images/warriors/Katy-Franco.jpg"" /><br /><br /><strong>THE CAUSE COMEDIENNE<br /><em>Katy Franco is an actress, comedienne, breast-cancer survivor, and coauthor of</em> Chemorella<em>. Her one-woman comedy show, </em>The Breast Years of My Life<em>, is at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles this month</em></strong><p></p><p>Ask Katy Franco and she'll tell you that breast cancer has made her a funnier person. A soap-opera actress in Puerto Rico (she played a husband-stealing villain who poisoned people), she moved to Los Angeles and, in 2005, was working the stand-up comedy circuit when she felt a burning sensation in her left breast. After her breast-cancer diagnosis, she continued performing right through chemo and radiation. ""When I was diagnosed, I had to find a reason to live,"" says Katy. ""Making other people laugh made me feel alive.""</p><p>Still, when her writing partner suggested she create a show about her experience, Katy hesitated. ""So many people think, Cancer's no laughing matter,"" she says. ""But the truth is, you're not laughing at the cancer. You're laughing at how absurd life can be."" (A joke in her repertoire: ""In solidarity with me during my chemotherapy treatment, my 70-year-old mother offered to shave her head. I said, 'You know, Mom, I would really appreciate it if you shaved your legs!'"")</p><p>When you look at what's happening in your life as tragedy, you're going to feel tragic, says Katy. A key to fighting breast cancer-or, really, any of life's big speed bumps-is looking for the positive or the funny. Here, Katy's tips on finding laughter in trying times.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>""Rent funny movies, even if you're not in the mood. Or get on YouTube and watch one of those animal videos. Pets can be hilarious.""</p><p><strong>2.</strong>""Think of great memories. Ring a friend and ask, 'Do you remember when. . .?' See, you're already smiling.""</p><p><strong>3.</strong>""Play all the happy music. Especially songs that remind you of good times.""</p><p><strong>4.</strong>""If you have cancer, people will be very solemn. That's OK, but you also need to be around people who laugh a lot. It's contagious.""</p><p><strong>5.</strong> ""Act like a kid. I sang and danced around my house wearing hot-pink lipstick. I wrote a ridiculous rap about my cancer. I take my illness very seriously, but I also know that silliness can lead to happiness.""</p><p></p><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/fuck-cancer/images/warriors/Ann-Patridge.jpg"" /><br /><br /><strong>THE THOUGHT LEADER<br /><em>Ann Partridge, M.D., M.P.H., is a medical oncologist, founder and director of the Program for Young Women with Breast Cancer, and director of the Adult Survivorship Program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. An associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a leader in her field, Ann works with young breast-cancer patients and tests new treatments. Her mission, besides working to find a cure, is to help women survive the disease while maintaining a high quality of life</em></strong><p></p><p>Turns out, breast cancer is a bit of a misnomer-or at least more of an umbrella term than a specific one. And cases in young women are generally different from cases in older women, which is why learning about the particulars could save your life.</p><p><em>As told to </em>WH<em> by Ann Partridge, M.D., M.P.H.</em></p><p>In 1999, my best friend from high school found a lump in her breast. She went for tests and was told it was probably nothing. She was just 30 years old; no one expected her to have cancer. But she did, and I saw up close and personal for the first time the unique illness and issues young breast-cancer patients face.</p><p>Breast cancer is not one disease. There are multiple kinds and, within those, many subcategories. Young women tend to get more aggressive, nastier breast cancers. Why? That's the Holy Grail question. Cancer is a disease of aging; risk generally has to do with environmental exposures over a lifetime. That doesn't make sense in a 30-year-old.</p><p>We just don't know enough yet, but one big problem is that because young women aren't frequently screened, their breast cancers are often diagnosed at a later stage. And those really aggressive tumors are more likely to come back, making young patients more likely to die of their breast cancers.</p><p>A red flag I look for is family history. If you have a first-degree relative with breast cancer, or if, say, your dad's mother had breast cancer at a young age, that could be a risk factor. Another one is drinking, which has been associated with breast-cancer risk in women of all ages. There's a ""dose response"" factor; the more you drink, the higher your risk. About six servings of alcohol a week should be your limit-no more than one glass (not goblet!) per day.</p><p>The good news is that unless you have a clear genetic predisposition (see ""The Action Hero,"" page 142), your risk is probably mutable. One really, really important thing you can do to reduce your chances is maintain a normal weight. The other big thing: regular exercise. It has repeatedly been linked to a decreased risk for breast cancer.</p><p></p><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/fuck-cancer/images/warriors/Innovators.jpg"" /><br /><br /><strong>THE INNOVATORS<br /><em>Julie Silver, M.D., is a physiatrist, an author, an entrepreneur, and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. Elizabeth Chabner Thompson, M.D., is a radiation oncologist, an entrepreneur, and a physician at 21st Century Radiation Oncology</em></strong><p></p><p>After Julie Silver, M.D., was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 38, she encountered a common patient paradox: Her treatment made her feel sicker than the disease ever did. The bigger problem? No one was doing anything about it. (Her doctor's advice: Go home and rest.) A rehabilitation specialist, Julie designed her own healing plan-then parlayed it into the STAR Program at Oncology Rehab Partners, the first-ever nationwide rehab program that uses tailored therapies to help patients bounce back from the harsh side effects of cancer treatment.</p><p>Similarly, when Elizabeth Chabner Thompson, M.D., had a prophylactic mastectomy at age 38, she found herself in the very situation her patients often lamented: Her pre-op checklist was overwhelming and her post-op surgical bra was a chafing, painful mess. Elizabeth pooled her resources and launched BFFL, a line of bags sold online and in hospitals, stuffed with every imaginable patient need (support pillows, surgical drain care packs, toiletries, and more). This month, she'll debut her second innovation: Masthead, a line of pain-free surgical and radiation bras. Here, Elizabeth and Julie chat about how it's imperative to speak up when you see something's not right-and how the best solutions can stem from your own ideas.</p><p><strong>Julie Silver:</strong> Doctors learn that suffering is inevitable. But unnecessary suffering is intolerable. I suffered enough going through toxic treatments. The fact that I wasn't offered any help in healing was intolerable. I had no choice but to heal myself.</p><p><strong>Elizabeth Thompson:</strong> When you see something isn't right, you first need to ask why. In my case, the answer I got was ""This is the way we have done it from the get-go."" When I proposed solutions, people said, ""Go for it.""</p><p><strong>JS:</strong> Sometimes it's easy
to think of the solution, but executing it is not as easy. Understanding your goals and staying true to your mission are important, but it's more than that. My biggest issue was challenging the status quo. I found myself saying over and over again to doctors, ""Please don't tell patients to accept a 'new normal' before you offer them rehab."" And to patients: ""You shouldn't accept this new normal!""</p><p><strong>ET:</strong> My biggest hurdles were finding fabrics, overcoming design challenges, and patenting my ideas without bankrupting my family. I had many, many sleepless nights.</p><p><strong>JS:</strong> It's hard to do it alone. Innovators need teams of really smart and dedicated people to work with them.</p><p><strong>ET:</strong> I could not have made it to where we are without input from other women. For example, a friend of mine in the apparel industry was horrified when I showed her the standard-issue surgical bra. She helped me find better fabric for my new one.</p><p><strong>JS:</strong> I get a lot of e-mails from people thanking me for supporting cancer survivors' healing. They keep me going.</p><p><strong>ET:</strong> I couldn't agree more. All the hard work pays off. Hospital administrators have told me about patients ""paying it forward"" by ordering a BFFL bag for someone after they themselves received one. These stories keep me motivated.</p><p><strong>JS:</strong> It's amazing when you can touch someone's life at a time when they're vulnerable. I do whatever I can to make sure what happened to me doesn't happen to other people.</p><p></p><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/breast-center/images/Lindsay-Avner.jpg"" /><br /><br /><strong>The ACTION HERO<br /><em>Lindsay Avner, founder and CEO of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://BrightPink.org"">Bright Pink</a>, a nonprofit that focuses on the prevention and early detection of breast and ovarian cancers in young women and provides support to high-risk individuals. Started in 2007, Bright Pink has eight national chapters and over 50,000 members</em></strong><p></p><p><em>Women who carry the BRCA gene mutation have up to an 87 percent risk of developing breast cancer and up to a 44 percent risk of getting ovarian cancer by age 70. (Women who don't carry the DNA but have a strong family history are also at a high breast-cancer risk.) The stats seem scary, but as <strong>Lindsay Avner</strong> tells it, knowing your risk level-and understanding your choices-can be surprisingly empowering.</em></p><p>My grandmother and great-grandmother died a week apart. Breast cancer took them both, when they were 39 and 58, respectively. I never knew them, but I know their struggle: When I was 12, I watched my mom battle breast cancer and, soon after, ovarian cancer. She survived but, all told, 11 women on my mother's side of the family have lost their lives to one of these diseases.</p><p>I was convinced I wouldn't be like them. I was built more like my dad, all skinny arms and legs; surely, my health would take after his. So in the summer of 2005, when my mother told me her cancers were genetic, that she carried the BRCA1 gene mutation and that I had a 50-50 chance of carrying it too, I thought I would test negative. I didn't.</p><p>After I got my results, I cried for weeks and weeks. I eventually landed in the ER when my colon started spasming from stress. Some experts say finding out you carry the BRCA mutation can be just as devastating as finding out you have cancer. They may be right.</p><p>At first, I regretted ever walking down the path of risk assessment. I was single, starting a new job in a new city, and suddenly navigating what it means to live at high risk. I enrolled in an early detection program that included mammograms, ultrasounds, clinical exams, and blood tests every six months. Though I was technically healthy, getting poked and prodded so often made me feel like something was already wrong, like I was just waiting to get cancer instead of reducing my chances of developing it.</p><p>In August 2006, when I was 23 years old, I became, per my doctors, the youngest woman in the country to get a risk-reducing double mastectomy and nipple-sparing reconstruction. Scientifically, it made a ton of sense: My odds of developing breast cancer fell to less than 1 percent. Emotionally, I was terrified I'd feel broken, tainted, like less of a woman, that the guys I'd date might not see me as whole. But after the surgery, I surprised myself by feeling healthy and strong. I found a new kind of beauty inside me I never knew existed. I grew to consider my scars cool; the two small lines on the outer quadrants of my breasts tell one hell of a story. The first time my shirt came off with a new boyfriend, my eyes filled with tears when he looked at my chest and simply said, ""They're perfect.""</p><p>Six years have passed, but my fight against cancer is far from over. I began my twenties by removing my breasts and now, as I approach 30, I am starting to prepare for another surgery. Because there are no good tests for ovarian cancer, which is deadly and can strike young in BRCA carriers, my doctors recommend I have ovary-removing surgery at age 35, by 40 at the latest. The procedure would push me into menopause, something most women don't experience until they're around 50. Hot flashes, insomnia, low sex drive-not how I'd envisioned my thirties.</p><p>As I think about this next step, those old concerns about my femininity are beginning to resurface. But here's my deeper worry: I'm single, and if I don't have kids in the next few years, I might not be able to have them naturally at all. The question every woman asks herself on a first or second date-could he be The One?--has taken on new meaning. In my head, the follow-ups unroll: Does he want kids soon . . . like, really soon? How can I tell if he'd be a great dad? How would he feel about embryo freezing?</p><p>That last question is the trickiest, but it's also a reminder that I do have options. Even if I don't find the right guy soon, I can still try to preserve my fertility. I could get a sperm donor and freeze a collection of embryos or, thanks to advances in egg freezing, I could have my eggs put on ice, to be thawed and used after ovary removal surgery. (Both require in vitro fertilization, for me or a surrogate, and it's now possible to test for BRCA mutations in embryos.)</p><p>If this seems like a lot to handle, it is. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't scared and overwhelmed by the thought of another surgery; by the pressure to find my soul mate and have kids sooner rather than later; by the shots, weight gain, and expenses associated with egg retrieval. But I know something that's way scarier: developing ovarian cancer. As I grapple with this, I'm keeping in mind that, for me, being proactive is better than being reactive, that prevention is better than treatment.</p><p>Every woman has a choice of finding out whether she's at high risk for breast or ovarian cancer. In my case, while it's sometimes hard to predict how I will feel at each milestone of this, I know that I am fortunate to have something generations of women before me did not--the ability to do something about my chances. More than anything, I know what I want for myself and for the daughter I hope to have someday: a long, healthy, cancer-free life.</p>",

But let's face it: For a lot of people, biting into a thick, juicy steak ranks up there with make-up <a target=""_blank"" href=""/sex-and-relationships"">sex</a> and cocktails on the company's dime as one of those priceless MasterCard moments. So what's a carnivore with a conscience to do? Instead of focusing on what you're eating, how about taking a look at what your prime rib had for lunch last week? Research is showing that beef from grass-fed cattle is leaner, healthier, and less costly to the<a target=""_blank"" href=""/life/go-green""> planet</a>--and may even be safer to eat than the heifers you're chewing on now.</p><p><b>Omega Moos</b></p><p>Most U.S. raised bovines feast on a grain mix made up mainly of cheap corn. Just like humans on a high-carb diet, grain-fed cows fatten up fast. This gives ranchers a quick, inexpensive turnaround from the feedlot to your <a target=""_blank"" href=""/nutrition/premium-packaged-foods"">supermarket</a>'s meat department. But a number of retro ranchers are feeding their herds the way they all did 50 or so years ago: letting them roam the fields to graze at will. They're switching to grass for a variety of reasons, including a desire to improve their animals' quality of life.</p><p>It just so happens that what makes herds happy also makes their meat healthier. Beef from grass-fed meat (the industry lingo is ""grass-fed beef"") packs up to a third less fat per serving. The fat it does have boasts more benefits: A three-ounce serving contains 35 milligrams of the heart- and brain-protecting <a target=""_blank"" href=""/nutrition/good-fats"">omega-3s</a> EPA and DHA, compared with only 18 milligrams for the same serving of meat from grain-fed stock. Steers that munch on pasture also have twice the conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) per serving (26 milligrams, compared with 13 milligrams in grain-fed). According to Kate Clancy, Ph.D., a senior fellow at the Minnesota Institute for Sustainable Agriculture, early research in rats has linked higher CLA levels with easier weight loss and a reduced risk of heart disease as well as certain types of cancer. </p><p>Another possible health perk: fewer bouts of food sickness. The <i>Journal of Dairy Science</i> has reported that levels of E. coli are usually higher in grain-fed cattle. The leading theory, says David Pimentel, Ph.D., professor of ecology and agricultural sciences at Cornell University, is that grain creates an environment in a steer's stomachs (they have four of them, remember?) that's more hospitable to the nasty bug, adding to the likelihood that the meat of a grain-fed animal will be contaminated with E. coli during processing. </p><p><b>More Grass, Less Gas</b></p><p>Cattle farms leave a Sasquatch-size footprint on our air quality, but that can't all be blamed on Bessie's methane-emitting farts. The problem is that growing the corn to feed the cows produces a load of greenhouse gases. Corn production takes a huge number of what those in the enviro biz call energy inputs. Among these are chemical fertilizers added to the soil and the fuel that's burned by harvesting machines. In fact, a single acre of corn requires 14 energy inputs, Pimentel says. That wouldn't be a big deal if we were growing just enough corn on the cob for the Johnsons' annual clambake, but the U.S. produces 1.5 billion bushels of the yellow stuff each year--just to feed cows. </p><p>By contrast, a field of grass gets its energy from the sun--pretty much the ultimate renewable resource. Of course, ecofriendly ranchers still use farm machinery and transport the beef on trucks, but it takes half the fossil-fuel energy to produce two pounds of grass-fed as it does to produce the same amount of grain-fed, Pimentel says. Bottom line: Eating a burger that has nibbled on turf reduces our damage to the planet in a big way.</p><p><b>Claim Your Steak</b></p><p>We'll readily admit that the place you feel the grass-fed-versus-grain-fed difference most is at the supermarket. A seven-ounce top sirloin steak from a grass-fed steer--that is, if you can find it--will run you about $9.50, compared with about $2.20 for conventional beef. But if higher-priced beef cuts down overall meat consumption, the cost might not be so bad: Consider that the American Institute for Cancer Research recommends eating less than 18 ounces of beef a week (regardless of what the cow eats) and that researchers at the University of Chicago have found that if Americans reduced red meat consumption by 20 percent, they'd save as much energy as they would if they switched from regular sedans to Priuses. </p><p>So where <i>do </i>you find it? Though still rare, grass-fed beef is distributed by 1,000 companies--a huge leap from 1999, when there were just a dozen, says Allan Nation, editor of <i>The Stockman Grass Farmer.</i> Specialty stores like Whole Foods now offer it, and some supermarket chains, including Publix, are starting to sell it. Farmers markets and local-food merchants are also good places to look. But the best place to buy may be online--sites will either direct you to stores in your area or ship the beef right to your home. (<a target=""_blank"" href=""/nutrition/benefits-of-grass-fed-beef?page=4"">See our list of Web sources</a>.) No matter where you're shopping, look for your top round roast to bear a black-and-white label that reads grass-fed and USDA process verified. Just last year, the USDA raised its standards for what could be termed ""grass-fed,"" and the agency plans to debut the new label soon, though it hasn't determined when.</p><p><b>Steer master: Tips for cooking grass-fed beef to perfection</b></p><p>For many beef enthusiasts, a grass-fed steak tastes the way a good piece of meat should: rich and earthy. (Corn's high sugar content makes mainstream beef taste sweeter; over the years, our tastes have adapted to it.) Because of the difference in texture and flavor, you will need to take a few extra but easy steps in the kitchen to make your meal the best it can be, says Michael Leviton, chef/owner of Lumière Restaurant and executive chef of Persephone Restaurant in Boston. He and fellow grass-fed specialist Eric Stenberg, executive chef of the Club at Spanish Peaks in Big Sky, Montana, suggest these three simple rules:</p><p><b>1. Defrost it in the fridge, not the microwave.</b> Grass-fed beef tends to be on the tough side, and the heat flash of nuking can cause the muscle fibers to shorten, making the meat even tougher.</p><p><b>2.

Stick with salt, black pepper, and a little olive oil, or create a subtle marinade out of crushed garlic, thyme, and bay leaves.</p><p><b>3. </b>Because grass-fed has less fat, it's quicker to dry out.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/best-yoga,Fitness,154,115,98,46,4,8386,12,0,,The Best Yoga Poses for You,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1105-yoga-art_0.jpg,"<p>If Jennifer Aniston's perpetually toned bod or a coworker's serenity during stressful times has convinced you to give yoga a try, you've come to the right place. We've put together a primer on styles that blast calories, promote relaxation, or increase your flexibility. Read this and soon you'll be reaping the om-azing benefits of this ancient form of exercise.</p><p><strong>Get A Cardio-Style Endorphin Rush</strong></p><p><strong>Pick:</strong> Bikram<br />Pack water and a towel-most Bikram studios have a tropical climate, with temperatures around 105°F with 40 percent humidity. ""The heat promotes sweating and warms up the body, making your muscles more flexible so they can stretch with less risk of injury,"" says Jennifer Lobo, co-owner of Bikram Yoga NYC. This workout (and take our word for it-it's a legit workout) is set up like a typical fitness class: a warmup, 20 minutes of cardio (through a series of quick, heart-revving poses), followed by a cooldown.</p><p><strong>Signature pose:</strong> Standing Head to Knee (stretches and strengthens legs). Standing on your right leg with knee straight, lift your left leg and clasp your hands beneath your left foot. Straighten your left leg in front of you as much as you can, then lower your forehead toward your left knee. Hold for a few breaths, then repeat with the other leg.</p><p><strong>Reduce Your Stress Level</strong></p><p><strong>Pick:</strong> Restorative<br />Can't drop everything and Eat, Pray, Love it off to an ashram? Try restorative yoga. Props such as bolsters, blankets, and blocks support your body so you can feel a deep release, poses are often held for 15 minutes, and snoozing is completely couth. ""Letting go physically encourages the mind to do the same,"" says Judith Hanson Lasater, Ph.D., author of Relax and Renew: Restful Yoga for Stressful Times. ""When we give the body support, that feeling can spill over into our emotional well-being,"" she says.</p><p><strong>Signature pose:</strong> Back Release (eases mental and physical tension). Sit on the floor facing a chair or couch, then lie back and place your lower legs on the seat. Your knees and hips will be bent. Support your head with a pillow, cover your eyes with a small cloth or towel, and let your body sink into the floor.</p><p><strong>Drop a Few Pounds</strong></p><p><strong>Pick:</strong> Vinyasa Flow<br />This flab-melting workout will have you moving continuously (but not effortlessly) from pose to pose. Because each vinyasa flow class is different (the pace, poses, and sequences vary), your muscles will constantly be challenged in new ways, which burns extra calories. And there's a bonus for boozehounds:</p><p>""The twisting poses are great for recovering from a hangover,"" says Kathryn Budig, a vinyasa flow instructor in Los Angeles. ""You're wringing yourself out, like a sponge.""</p><p><strong>Signature pose:</strong> Chaturanga (works your core, shoulders, and arms). Get into a pushup position, wrists beneath your shoulders. Gaze forward and slowly lower yourself halfway, keeping your shoulders over your wrists and squeezing your elbows close to your body.</p><p><strong>Boost Your Spirits</strong></p><p><strong>Pick:</strong> Anusara<br />Think of it as Prozac in a pose. This method unwinds your body while lifting your mood. Each class focuses on an inspirational idea (like feeling grounded or embodying confidence), which the style's founder, John Friend, calls a ""heart theme."" Expect some chanting and oms (feel free to speak up or sit quietly) and lots of classic moves such as lunges and planks. You'll probably partner up with a classmate for a pose or two to experience ""the joy of community"" and for some extra stretching you wouldn't be able to do on your own. (If your gym doesn't offer anusara, hatha is a worthy stand-in.)</p><p><strong>Signature pose:</strong> Downward-Facing Dog (stretches arms, shoulders, and legs). Get into a pushup position. Push your hips back while keeping your arms and legs straight so your body forms an upside-down V. Slide your shoulder blades back, allowing your neck and chest to relax.</p><p><strong>Build Strength Inside and Out</strong></p><p><strong>Pick:</strong> Power Yoga<br />This style may sound hardcore, but its name was actually inspired by the inner strength it develops. ""Each session improves your posture and creates more confidence, which breeds self-empowerment,"" says Rudy Mettia, founder of Corporalita Power Yoga in Los Angeles. That's not to say your muscles get off scot-free. Hardly. There's plenty of toning and lean muscle building for your core, legs, and glutes.</p><p><strong>Signature pose:</strong> King Dancer (boosts strength and balance). Stand on your left leg and bend your right knee so you can grab the front of your right foot with your right hand. Then extend your left arm in front of you and press your right leg behind you, leaning your torso forward slightly. Allow your right hand to grasp your ankle. Hold for a few breaths, then switch sides.</p><p><strong>Get a Competitive Edge</strong></p><p><strong>Pick:</strong> Yoga for Athletes<br />""Both competitive athletes and average women do lots of repetitive motions, which can lead to muscle imbalances and overuse injuries,"" says Emilie Smith, a yoga for athletes instructor in New York City.</p><p>""Yoga for athletes works your body through its full range of motion to create symmetry and balance."" After a dynamic warmup sequence and targeted strength-building poses, you'll finish with 15 to 20 minutes of longer, restorative stretches. Each class is designed to address specific student issues and rebalance the body.</p><p><strong>Signature pose:</strong> Warrior III (builds strength and balance). Stand on your left leg with your right leg extended straight behind you, and raise your arms overhead, palms facing each other. Keeping your core tight, raise your right leg as you lower your torso toward the floor until your upper body forms a straight line with your right leg. Hold for a few breaths, then switch sides.</p>",
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/healthy-breasts,Health,123,114,52,21,3,4,8,0,,Learning Curves: All About Breast Health,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/learning-curves-art.jpg,"<p>The 411 on everything boob-related: why you get sore breasts, the pros and cons of breast augmentation, and how to firm them up (a little) with exercise</p><p><strong>Fluid is leaking from my nipples, and I'm not pregnant. What gives?</strong><br />It's not unusual for weird-looking stuff to drip from the nipples, says Dayna Salasche, M.D., an ob-gyn in Chicago. It can come in many colors-yellow, green, white, gray, red-and vary from thick and sticky to thin and watery. Non-pregnancy-related discharge can occur either spontaneously or from stimulation (e.g., squeezing or sucking) and is most often the result of a benign papilloma (a noncancerous tumor), an infection, or a drug side effect. In rare cases, leakage can signal a hormonal imbalance or even breast cancer, so if you're not knocked up, consult your doc.</p><p><strong>Is it possible to breast-feed after having an augmentation?</strong><br />Usually. Most breast implants don't interfere with feeding, says Todd Malan, M.D., director of the Innovative Cosmetic Surgery Center in Scottsdale, Arizona. However, 20 percent of implants need to be readjusted surgically within the first year, and about 30 percent rupture after a decade. So while the original procedure might not affect feeding, the more surgeries you have, the more ligament damage is done and the more your breasts will sag. If you decide to lift that droopiness with even more surgery, your milk ducts might get damaged, which would interfere with nursing. Long story short: Be sure your surgeon gives you all the details.</p><p><strong>Can I boost my girls with exercise?</strong><br />Breasts don't have muscles, so quit trying to tone them. But you may be able to perk things up by tightening and defining the muscles around your breasts, says Jonathan Ross, a personal trainer in Bowie, Maryland. Try the following exercises (two sets of eight reps every day).</p><p><strong>Backward-Facing Wall Slide</strong><br />Stand with your heels, butt, shoulder blades, and head pressed against a wall. Raise your arms out to the sides at shoulder height and bend your elbows 90 degrees so your fingers are pointing toward the ceiling. Slowly slide your arms up the wall, then lower them back to the starting position.</p><p><strong>Front-Facing Wall Slide with Backward Reach</strong><br />Stand facing a wall with your feet hip-width apart and your toes six inches from the wall. Press your forearms against the wall, shoulder-width apart, fingers pointing up. Slide your palms up the wall until your arms are straight, then lift your arms away from the wall until your elbows are next to your ears; pull your shoulder blades together. Bring your arms back to the wall, then lower to the starting position.</p><p><strong>Bird Dog</strong><br />Get down on all fours with your hands and knees hip-width apart. Lift your right arm in front of you and extend your left leg behind you, keeping your hips and shoulders parallel to the floor and making sure the movements come only from your shoulder and hip, rather than your spine. Pause, then slowly lower to the starting position. Repeat with the opposite limbs.</p><p><strong>Why do my boobs kill me right before and during my period?</strong><br />Breast tissue is naturally tender-and it can take a real pounding from the hormonal seesaw of your menstrual cycle. During ovulation and its aftermath, estrogen and progesterone levels trade turns rising and falling, which can lead to headaches, mood changes, food cravings, cramps, and, yup, super-sore breasts. Sucking down lots of coffee or diet soda can make matters even worse, as excess caffeine can disrupt levels of reproductive and stress hormones and leave your ta-tas swollen and achy. To reduce the pain, Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., an ob-gyn at the Yale University School of Medicine, recommends taking this mix of nutrients daily during your period to reduce water retention and inflammation: 100 to 200 milligrams of vitamin B6, 200 to 400 IU of vitamin E, and two 500 IU capsules of evening primrose oil.</p><p><strong>Do some women really have a third nipple?</strong><br />Are you sitting down? Good. Here's the truth: Some women (and men) have up to six nipples.</p><p>""When a fetus is forming, it develops something called a milk line that's studded with nipples and runs from the armpits to the groin,"" says Michael Yang, M.D., an ob-gyn in Sunnyvale, Texas.</p><p>""It looks like what dogs and cats have, but in humans it usually disappears before birth."" Except when it doesn't. Sometimes supernumerary nipples come with extra tissue and develop like regular breasts; typically, though, they just sit on your skin-sans areolae-and look more like moles or skin tags than budding boobs. Not loving your extra teats? They can easily be removed with minor surgery.</p><p><strong>Is it harder to detect breast cancer if you have implants?</strong><br />Yes. Implants can get in the way during exams, potentially hiding small tumors. They can also make it more difficult for medical professionals to take and read mammograms, says Malan.</p><p><strong>I want to lose weight, but not from my breasts. Any chance?</strong><br />In an ideal world, sure. In reality, nope. ""Breasts are made up of mostly fat, and because losing weight is about losing fat, well...it's sad but true that breast volume is often the first to shrink as you slim down,"" says Salasche. But before you decide to ride the couch instead of a bike, know this: The body gains and loses fat systemically, so your overall proportions will probably stay the same and it's likely that no one will notice a difference.</p>",

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/holiday-diets,Nutrition,71,109,8,83,0,19,16,0,,Nutrition Tips to Survive the Holiday Season,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1012-eat-drink.jpg,"<p>During the holiday season, most people attend tons of festive events-and nearly all of them center around fattening food. Add seasonal stress and zero time to cook or hit the gym, and you have a recipe for holiday weight gain. Well, not this year! We came up with 10 tips to help you survive the hectic holiday season.<br /><br /><b>HOLIDAY PARTIES</b><br />It's inevitable that you'll be going to at least a few soirees this holiday season, whether it's the office holiday party or your neighbor's annual bash. Here are a few tactics you can employ.<br /><br /><b>Sip Smartly</b><br />> With alcohol, the goal is to keep both your calories and your buzz under control.<br />> A single shot of vodka, gin, or rum mixed with club or diet soda and a squeeze of lime will set you back only about 100 calories. Other standard low-cal options include light beer or wine, most of which have fewer than 150 calories per serving. That's perfect if you can sip one all night; if you're the type to make several trips to the bar (no judgments!), try asking the bartender to fill your glass only halfway each time to keep your total intake down.<br />> Champagne or pink Prosecco are both great options. Not only are they low on the calorie chart-around 80 to 120 per glass-but they're also more likely to be sipped rather than guzzled.<br /><br /><b>Work the Room</b><br />> If you're planted next to the food table, you'll shovel chips and dip into your mouth all night long. So stay far, far away. You won't eat mindlessly if you have to cross the room to get to the food or if you're chatting someone up.<br />> You should also be picky. Passed hors d'oeuvres, which hover at every turn, are small, but they add up-fast. To avoid eating 2,000 calories worth of cheese puffs, limit yourself to three that you love. Been waiting all year for bacon-wrapped scallops? Go for it. But pass on the crab cakes and other fried fare.<br /><br /><b>AT THE MALL</b><br />Another inevitability during the holidays is the mall food court, unless you've perfected the art of online shopping! Having to make decisions diminishes people's willpower. So all the gift decisions you face at the mall will make you that much more vulnerable to temptation at the food court.<br /><br /><b>Pack Snacks</b><br />> Malls are filled with kiosks hawking softball-size cinnamon buns and soft pretzels on steroids. Keeping portion-controlled goodies in your bag will make other snacks easier to resist. Stick 30 pistachios or 24 almonds in a ziplock bag with two dried plums or apricots, or even some turkey jerky or a snack bar with less than 200 calories and at least 5 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein. The carb/protein/fat combo in these foods will keep you full.<br /><br /><b>Sidestep Seasonal Sirens</b><br />> An economic theory called the scarcity principle explains why we're such suckers for holiday treats. Decades of research show that items we perceive as being in limited supply seem more desirable to us than non-scarce items. Holiday-themed coffee drinks and sweets are often more caloric than regular ones, so it's safer to stick to the basics. Add your own cinnamon to your every day coffee or drizzle your own vanilla or peppermint extract.<br /><br /><b>BAKING</b><br />If you're the baker in the family, you know there are many pitfalls when it comes to holiday baking. Baked goods aren't necessarily known to be health foods, and then there are the temptations while you're baking (cookie dough!). But don't let that derail you.<br /><br /><b>Cut The Fat, Not The Taste</b><br />> It wouldn't be the holidays without delicious treats like cookies, pies, cakes and brownies. But these tasty treats can be loaded with fat. There are clever ways to cut fat, while not sacrificing taste, when you're preparing the holiday goodies this season.<br />> In fruit pies, use half the amount of sugar the recipe calls for. You'll save 744 calories for every cup of sugar you don't use.<br />> In cookies and crusts, use half whole-wheat pastry flour and half all-purpose flour. Whole wheat has 12 grams of filling fiber in every cup and guests probably won't notice the difference if you cut the all-purpose flour with whole-wheat flour.<br />> In cheesecake, substitute part-skim ricotta cheese for cream cheese. You'll double the amount of hunger-fighting protein and cut the fat by close to 60 grams for each cup you use.<br />> In brownies, cakey cookies, and fruit breads, use pureed pumpkin instead of oil. For every half-cup of oil you sub out, you'll save more than 900 calories and 100 grams of fat using pumpkin puree instead. Plus, pumpkin puree keeps baked goods moist.<br /><br /><b>Resist the Temptation to ""Taste""</b><br />> It's easy to think that 'tastes' are calorie-free. But just because two spoonfuls of cookie dough fail to register emotionally doesn't mean they don't count. In fact, they count right up to 500 calories. To resist temptation, clean as you go. Have a pan of hot, soapy water on standby and plunge batter-covered beaters and spoons into it once you're done with them. This protects you from nibbling and cleanup is that much easier. If all else fails, when you're tempted by a cookie-dough-laden mixing spoon, remember this: The raw eggs in that dough may contain salmonella, a bacteria that can cause food poisoning and was the reason for the recall of more than 380 million eggs earlier this year.<br /><br /><b>THE BIG MEAL</b><br />Once you've successfully navigated your way through all the parties, made it out of the mall without consuming the large gingerbread frappuccino, and baked healthy holiday treats without as much as a nibble of raw cookie dough, there's still another pitfall. The big, sit-down holiday meal! Don't fret, there are tactics to make it through without feeling like you're the stuffed turkey.<br /><br /><b>Downsize your dishware:</b><br />> Extensive diet research shows that people eat what's put on their plates--even if it's more than they need to satisfy their hunger. If you have huge dinner plates, buy smaller dishes for your home. For example:<br />> Purchase a set of inexpensive salad plates, 7 to 9 inches in diameter, vs. 10-12 inches<br />>Also, downsize your glasses so you don't consume too many liquid calories. It's more difficult to exercise portion control when you're pouring into a large glass. Instead of drinking out of pint glasses, use smaller juice glasses and stay away from oversized wine glasses.<br />> You'll also want to consider your serving dishes. In studies, people ate as much as 56 percent more when they served themselves from a one-gallon bowl than they did from a half-gallon one. If you use smaller serving dishes that hold less food, people will be less likely to over-serve themselves.<br /><br /><b>Have a Game Plan</b><br />> Variety may be the spice of life, but it's the scourge of your scale. The more options there are, the more we want to try.<br />> One tactic is to offer to bring a healthy dish. Your stressed-out hostess will welcome the contribution, and you'll have a safe go-to.<br />> You should also practice portion control. Your total amount of carbs- potatoes, cranberry sauce, stuffing-should be the size of your fist. You shouldn't be eating as much as your uncle who used to be a linebacker in college. The same goes for lean proteins, which should be the size and thickness of your palm (no fingers).<br /><br /><b>Make Conscious Indulgences</b><br />> If you're a dessert person and you know you won't be able to pass up that piece of cheesecake, don't deprive yourself. You'll just find yourself at the fridge at 2am with fork in hand. Instead, pass on the roll with butter at dinner and have a small piece of cheesecake. You'll enjoy it guilt-free and not feel like you're missing out.<br /><br /><b>Get Creative with Your Leftovers</b><br />> Use leftovers to your advantage, so you're not wasteful.<br />> For example, fresh turkey on spinach salad after Thanksgiving. Or, make a big turkey veggie soup.<br />> If you're serving ham, try a protein charged ham omelet or an open-faced ham and reduced fat cheddar sandwich.<br /> </p>","holiday eating,healthy eating"

""Built on three fundamentals of training-cardio, strength, and agility-boot-camp workouts require little more than your body weight to get results,"" says Christopher Mohr, Ph.D., R.D., of Mohr Results Adventure Boot Camp for Women in Louisville, Kentucky. ""They're more intense than any fitness class and more fun than traditional gym workouts.""</p><p>Try these expert tips and our ""DIY Boot-Camp Workout"" (at right) to kick your body transformation into high gear.</p><p><strong>Stick to Basics</strong><br />Put aside your stability ball: Boot camps are all about bare essentials, starting with the moves. By stringing together exercises like jumping jacks, pushups, and squats into circuits that go from one move to the next with little or no rest in between, these workouts turn your body into an uber-efficient resistance machine. ""The moves target muscles throughout your entire body,"" Mohr says. ""They're much more effective than equipment-based exercises that isolate one single muscle group at a time.""</p><p><strong>Follow the Clock</strong><br />""Set a time limit for each exercise- think 20 to 60 seconds,"" says trainer Laurel Blackburn, owner of Boot Camp Fitness and Training in Tallahassee, Florida. It keeps you from pushing too hard and from slacking. ""If I told you 'Do squats until I say stop,' you wouldn't give 100 percent. But if I said 'Do squats for 30 seconds,' you'd work harder because you'd see the end in sight.""</p><p><strong>Take it Outside</strong><br />Without fancy equipment or complicated moves, you can do a boot-camp workout anywhere-a park, a playground, even a parking lot. And taking your sweat session outside has some serious perks: When researchers compared the mental benefits of an outdoor workout with an indoor one, 71 percent of the fresh-air exercisers felt less tense afterward, while 72 percent of the cooped-up crew felt even more stressed.</p><p><strong>Buddy Up</strong><br />One key to success is camaraderie. ""A group makes you accountable to show up, and the support helps you push through an intense workout,"" Mohr says. When it comes to fitness, the power of your peeps is well documented: One review of 87 studies on nearly 50,000 subjects found a clear link between social support and exercise. Enlist a small group of friends who have similar fitness goals and pick a time and place. If you're a no-show, next time they'll make you drop and do 20.</p>",

But hey, bunions and bone spurs happen...a lot. Research from the nation's <a href=""/health/top-doctors-for-women"">top doctors</a> shows that most people have a foot injury of some sort by age 40, and women undergo the majority of common-problem foot surgeries. Sidestep heinous maladies by treating your feet right.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Foot Foes</b><br /><br />Genes play a leading role in female foot woes. So does anatomy: ""In general, women have narrower heels and weaker joints than men do,""says Frank Valente, D.C., a chiropractor in Manhattan. ""Plus, irregular menstrual cycles and lower-fat diets can decrease bone mass, putting women at increased risk for ankle sprains and dislocated foot bones."" Also, wider hips mean that some women are predisposed to walking knock-kneed, which can throw off the body's alignment and stance, and potentially lead to foot injuries, says Eric Horton, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon in San Diego.<br /><br /><br /></p><p><b>High Times</b><br /><br /><br />Stilettos can make your feet hurt like hell for a reason. ""One-inch heels can increase the pressure on your feet by about 22 percent,"" says orthopedic surgeon Steven Raikin, M.D., of the Rothman Institutein Philadelphia. ""Two inches can add up to 57 percent, and three inches can add a whopping 76 percent."" That pressure means toes are crammed into a tight area, and the long-term results can be very unsultry bunions or clawlike hammertoes. What's more, so much weight shifting onto the feet causes calf muscles to clench up and eventually tighten, making it hard to walk normally even on days you wear flats. Platform and wedge shoes are a bit kinder, but most still have an unnatural incline, says Catherine Cheung, D.P.M., a podiatrist in San Francisco.<br /><br /><br /></p><p><b>Happy Feet</b><br /><br /><br />No, you don't have to pack your closet exclusively with Crocs. Just follow these tips:<br /><br /><br /></p><p>> Try not to stand or walk around in heels higher than two inches for more than four hours straight, says Horton. (If you do wear way-high heels on a big night out, ice your feet when you get home to curb any swelling or pain.)<br /><br /><br /></p><p>> Remember that feet can still grow and spread throughout adulthood (especially after pregnancy) and tend to be at their most swollen at the end of the day, so do your shoe shopping in the afternoon. Have your feet measured every year to make sure you're buying the right size.<br /><br /><br /></p><p>> For extra heel and arch cushioning, slip orthopedic inserts into your flats. Most won't fit into skimpy high heels, so use gel pads there instead. You can buy them at a drugstore for around $20, or spring for custom-made orthotics from a doc.<br /><br /><br /></p><p>> As your body's essential support system, your feet can take a lot of weight, but ""every pound you gain means an extra three pounds of pressure in your ankle region,"" says Raikin. Yet another reason to always maintain a healthy weight.<br /><br /><br /></p><p>> To keep your feet limber, do stretches such as writing the alphabet with pointed toes; to massage your arches, roll your feet over a tennis ball for a few minutes a day; and to stretch your ankle and calf, extend your knee, place a towel around the ball of your foot, and pull toes toward you.<br /><br /><br /></p><p><b>Cures for Common Problems</b><br /><br /><br />Blisters: Using a needle that's been disinfected with rubbing alcohol, make a small hole at the edge of each blister and drain any fluid. Apply a topical antibiotic like bacitracin or Neosporin and cover with a fresh adhesive bandage each day for three days.<br /><br /><br /></p><p>Calluses: Soak your feet in warm water with Epsom salts for 15 to 20 minutes, then rub a pumice stone over your calluses to remove dry, tough skin. Finish with a rich, moisturizing foot cream.<br /><br /></p>",You and Improved

Yogurt can stave off the bad stuff -- from colds to yeast infections to flatulence. No wonder foods containing healthy bugs, known as probiotics (from the Greek, ""for life""), are hitting the shelves of U.S. grocery stores faster than the latest dancing Elmo doll.<br /><br />As with high fashion and Clive Owen, Europeans were onto this practice long before we were. Around 1900, Elie Metchnikoff, Ph.D., a Nobel Prizewinning Russian researcher, noticed something peculiar: Yogurt-loving Bulgarians were living as long as 100 years. The process of fermenting dairy products to create yogurt (and its cousin, the fermented milk drink kefir) involves adding live bacteria. Metchnikoff concluded that those bacteria were responsible for Bulgarians' extended lifespan. Europeans and Asians began enthusiastically eating the stuff, but Americans are just now catching on, thanks to a recent boom in probiotics research and <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/best-packaged-foods-for-women"">yogurt nutrition</a>. ""The immune system and digestive tract are so complex that we are just beginning to understand how probiotics work in the body,"" says Mary Ellen Sanders, Ph.D., executive director of the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics.<br /><br /><b>The Good, the Bad, and the Nasty</b><br /><br />Here's what we do know. Your digestive system is like Casablanca for microorganisms: Some 400 species of bacteria and yeast can be found there. Some are locals, created by your body; others are tourists, just visiting after you ingest them via food. Of these microorganisms, those like <i>salmonella</i> and some species of <i>E. coli</i> are nasty (usually the tourists, naturally). And others like <i>L. casei</i> and <i>L. reuteri</i> can be nice - very nice. ""<a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/colds"">Probiotics</a> are basically any microorganism that, when ingested, may benefit human health,"" says Athos Bousvaros, M.D., a specialist in gastroenterology and nutrition at Children's Hospital Boston.<br /><br />According to Dr. Bousvaros, your digestive tract houses much of your immune system, a complex constellation of cells and tissues that fight pathogenic organisms that can make you sick. Having more of the beneficial organisms there may help prevent illness: They protect you both by stunting the growth of the nasty ones on the spot and by forcing them out, essentially taking all the free seats in the digestive tract; the bad guys just have to move on, ultimately exiting your system. When the number of good bugs drops - for example, after a course of antibiotics, which kills many of the good guys as well as the bad - you might be more likely to get sick. And as you age, your natural levels of beneficial bacteria decrease. But swallowing 'em can help get you healthy, plus stop trouble before it starts.<br /><br />Probiotics give your immune system a boost. New research shows that <i>L. reuteri</i> can help you kick the Kleenex while your colleagues sniffle. A study in Sweden found that workers taking the probiotics were healthier than the pla - cebo group, who called in sick two and half times more. ""<i>L. reuteri</i> helps keep you healthy by secreting reuterin, an antimicrobial agent that prevents the growth of pathogenic microorganisms in the gut,"" says Vicki Koenig, R.D.<br /><br />They fight itch below the belt. Yeast and bacteria are like the Sharks and the Jets of your body. When you have similar amounts of both, they mind their own business - sort of a microorganism cease-fire. But when the balance is upset, yeast can run rampant, leaving you with an itchy infection. ""Probiotics keep the yeast population down by crowding them out and competing for the same food,"" Koenig says. The traditional remedy is yogurt - but you've got to eat it, not smear it on. ""If inserted vaginally, the milk sugar in yogurt can feed the yeast, making the infection worse,"" she warns.<br /><br />They keep you moving. European women have long used probiotics to stay regular, and research seems to be backing them up (or not, so to speak). ""Probiotics produce short-chain fatty acids in the colon that can help retain moisture and result in softer stools,"" Sanders says. Studies conducted at the Georges Pompidou European Hospital in Paris found that subjects moved their bowels in less time (which is good, since slow bowels can lead to health problems) when eating yogurt containing the probiotic <i>B. animalis</i> daily. ""They saw results within 2 weeks of starting the probiotic treatment,"" says Philippe Marteau, M.D., lead researcher and head of gastroenterology at the Lariboisire Hospital in Paris.<br /><br />They reduce gas emissions. Most lactose-intolerant people see dairy and think farting and bloating. But it turns out that in dairy foods with live active bacteria, the probiotics used for fermentation produce lactase, an enzyme that digests lactose before it reaches the colon and stirs up trouble. A study in the <i>Journal of the American Dietetic Association</i> found that kefir improved lactose digestion and reduced gas in the lactose intolerant.<br /><br /><b>Where the Bugs Are</b><br /><br />So how do you tap into these little monsters' power? There are no government recommendations for how many - or what kinds - of probiotics you should gulp down. So it's up to you to do a little research. ""Just as different vitamins have different effects, the various probiotic strains impart different health benefits,"" Sanders says. (See ""<a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/article/0,6176,s1-2-63-1285-1,00.html"">Bugs to the Rescue</a>"")The no-brainer approach is a daily cup of yogurt. Depending on the brand, it contains most of the good bacteria you need. ""With yogurt, you also get the benefits of nutrients such as calcium, riboflavin, and vitamin B12,"" says Densie Webb, Ph.D., R.D., coauthor of <i>The Dish: On Eating Healthy and Being Fabulous!</i><br /><br />If you're sick of yogurt, consider trying a supplement or one of the new products with added probiotics. As more manufacturers pile on the healthy-gut bandwagon, the market for probiotic ingredients is expected nearly to triple by 2010, according to Frost & Sullivan, a London-based consulting firm. Many of the new items are still in the dairy aisle in smoothie form like Yakult from Japan. But probiotics are popping up in unrefrigerated foods too, such as Kashi Vive cereal and Attune bars. They taste pretty good, but research hasn't yet determined whether they work as well as yogurt (though the outlook is good).<br /><br />As for pills, ""no studies have shown that probiotics in a food are more effective than in a supplement,"" Dr. Bousvaros says. Look for a brand that specifies on its label the viable dose of live bacteria or yeast - which varies by strain but is often between 1 billion and 10 billion - through its shelf life, like Culturelle or Florastor.<br /><br />Does booze have similar benefits? The jury's still out, but research suggests red wine and dark beer may have probiotic effects. So have a glass - right after your yogurt - and celebrate your health.<br />","healthy eating,Smart Shopping"

Perhaps no one thinks of them more often than the handful of young women now occasionally permitted to use the field-the roughly two dozen members of the country's first female soccer club, the Afghan women's national football team. (In most parts of the world, soccer is called football.)</p><p>It's only on rare days they practice outside-the large field is usually reserved for men-but when they do, the players sense the ghosts of the women who died there, most of them shot execution-style in front of thousands of men for crimes such as adultery. ""There was a lady in a burka who they stoned to death there when I was a child, and when we go to play, I think about her body under the grass,"" said Sabra Azizi, 20, who plays midfield.</p><p>The Taliban-a fundamentalist Islamic regime that ruled large parts of Afghanistan-were forced out of power 10 years ago (they're now fighting a guerrilla war to win back control), yet the barriers for women, especially in sports, remain monumental. In truth, it's a near miracle the team plays at all. The members, who range in age from 16 to 24, are up against widespread resentment from their relatives and neighbors, and threats from men who disapprove of women playing sports.</p><p>They're able to practice just three times a week for 90 minutes, occasionally at the stadium or in its gym, but more often at a helicopter landing pad on a base for NATO troops, where practices are interrupted by takeoffs and landings. No other facilities in the city are considered appropriate; the idea of a woman playing sports is still so shocking that it would be considered indecent for men who aren't relatives to see them practicing, even in uniforms that cover nearly every inch of their skin.<br /></p><p>To travel to practice, some of the women must take four taxis because they live in outlying areas of Kabul-a sprawling, crowded city of 5 million people, where the air is thick with pollution from coal and wood fires, and most neighborhoods still have open sewers. When there's snowfall or a dust storm (or, yes, intermittent bomb explosions), the players' parents often keep their children from leaving the house.</p><p>The women's football team is used to not having public support, cheering crowds, or fans. It's rare to see a parent on the sidelines. At a recent exhibition game played in honor of International Women's Day, only one set of parents were among the small group of spectators. ""We are the first women footballers in Afghanistan, and we are trying to tell the world, 'Yes, we can do this,' "" says Palwasha Dawood, 20, who plays defense. ""But we are always hearing, 'Football, this is not for women.' That is what people say.""</p><p>Nonetheless, driven by their passion for the game, these players have managed to challenge the cultural oppression that severely limits women's choices in Afghanistan. And they play with a zeal that's clear to the Americans and Europeans who have watched them in action. ""You can see what joy they get from playing,"" says Henning Nielsen, marketing director of Hummel, a Danish sporting-goods company that recently decided to sponsor the team. ""There is a lot they don't have, and they need professional training, but you can see what soccer means to them.""<br /><br /><br /></p><p><b>Breaking Down Barriers</b><br /><br />Afghan girls only began to participate in sports in 2005, four years after the fall of the Taliban, when many families who had fled to Pakistan returned with daughters who had played sports in schools there. Television, which had been banned under the Taliban, also became increasingly widespread, and sports channels drew the interest of women as well as men.</p><p>The women's minister at the time, Massouda Jalal, who handled social issues such as domestic violence, went to Germany and was overwhelmed by the enthusiasm for girls' sports, especially football. She asked if the German government could help the Afghans get started, and it did, offering seminars for Afghan sports teachers. By the end of 2005, the search was on for players for a women's national team, thanks to the open-minded leadership of Karamuddin Kareem, head of the Afghan Football Federation, which sponsors the men's national team.</p><p>At the time, only one girls high school in all of Afghanistan consistently offered a sports class. Now, three or four of them have become feeders for the team, largely because of the indefatigable work of a few physical-education teachers. One of them, Bilgis Azimi, says they struggle every day to make it possible for their students to play. She gets little support from the other teachers at her school. ""They tell me, 'Sports are for sluts,' "" she says.</p><p>That's an attitude the players of the national team confront daily. Sabra's uncles berate her mother and father for allowing her to play. ""One of my uncles says, 'It is a shame,' and his son says to my brothers, 'If you are a man, your women will be covered. Maybe you are not man enough to control her.' "" On a recent afternoon, Sabra packed her sports clothes and athletic shoes and turned to go out the front door for practice, but her uncle, who was visiting, stepped in front of her. ""He blocked me and wouldn't let me go. I turned back to go into my room, but instead went into the bathroom and climbed out the window,"" she says.</p><p>Some of the team members receive harassing calls on their cell phones from young men they don't know but who have somehow found out their phone numbers. Sometimes they call repeatedly and hang up. More frightening, though, are the whispered threats. Roia Noorahmed, 16, the team's captain, arrived at practice one day in late April, visibly shaken. A male stranger had called her cell phone repeatedly as she walked to practice, saying, ""I need to talk to you. I need to see you."" Then he warned, ""Don't walk so close to the Ashiana mosque-I know what I will do to you,"" just as she was crossing in front of that mosque. She scanned the crowd, wondering who had made the call. She looked at the cars filled with passengers. Anyone could grab her, force her into a car, and just say she was a bad girl who had run away from home... and no one would do anything.</p><p>Like Sabra, everyone on the team has endured a trial of objections to be there. For Roia, it has been her mother's fears that the community would censure the family; she herself wed at 12, and she worries that Roia, at 16 and a known football player, will never marry. For Raffura Qayom, 18, it is her mother's concern that football will interfere with schoolwork. For Khalida Popal, 23, who plays defense and is the team's finance manager, it is her father's disapproval, along with her relatives' concern about her trips out of the country to play against other teams. ""They think I will behave badly with men. They think no one will be willing to marry a girl who plays football. [To them, playing sports] means you are a bad girl and have affairs with all men,"" she says with a shrug, adding a sentiment that several of her team members have also expressed: ""When a girl wants to become a football player, she has to decide between her future as a woman who will get married and football.""</p><p>An exception is Zohra Mahmoodi, 20. A tall, slender midfielder, Zohra learned to play when she and her family were refugees in Iran. Her father, who ran a small factory that made soccer balls, let her come and kick balls after hours. She played with her brothers in the family's yard, and she played at school. ""It was our family sport,"" she says. ""Everyone in Iran is watching football. We were watching football, playing football, talking about football. There, my big brothers supported me."" Now that she and her family live in Kabul, they're still supportive, but she can't practice at home because they no longer have a big yard. Still, she's determined to have a career in sports someday.<br /><br /><br /></p><p><b>Playing Under Wraps</b><br /><br />Although women's troubles in Afghanistan are often linked to the presence of the Taliban, that vastly underestimates the depth of the prejudice women face. Long before the Taliban rose to power, there was a conservative attitude toward women's behavior. The Taliban took it much further: Women were required to wear burkas that completely covered their bodies and faces, and girls were not allowed to attend school. Now, years after the end of the Taliban's rule, the society remains rigidly restrictive of women's lives-what they wear, when they go out, how they behave. The laws have been modernized, but custom and culture dictate strict limits.</p><p>This is evident in the head coverings the players wear on the field. Those from more conservative families wear scarves that completely cover their hair; players from more liberal families wear broad bands that cover most of their hair. Those whose families are the least conservative don baseball caps. All of them wear uniforms of long pants and baggy, long-sleeved tees. Some women pull a skirt over their pants.</p><p>The risks of not covering up in this way are real. If a TV news program were to show a clip of the girls playing without proper head coverings, their families might stop them from participating altogether. The team has lost at least three team members for similar reasons, says Sabra.</p><p>Their coach, Wahidi Wahidullah, a gentle, serious man who is deeply loyal to the team, says the social stigma against female athletes inhibits the players from giving their all to the game. ""Even in the gym at the Olympic stadium, you can see they don't feel safe enough,"" he says. ""When we go to a match, they're worried about their appearance, about their heads being covered, and they don't play well; they lose their concentration,"" he says.</p><p>The girls are painfully aware that the smallest misstep can sabotage them. ""Did you see me out there with a very tight scarf?"" Sabra pants as the team takes a break from practice. ""If my scarf falls down, people will say, 'You see, she is a very loose woman. She can shake hands with any man.' But of course, keeping your scarf on tightly is very hard when you are running and using your head to hit the ball.""</p><p>Raffura, who plays defense, says she's always on guard to prevent a glimpse of hair or flesh. ""I am always thinking, I have to take care when I jump so that nothing shows. We are thinking about our hijab [head covering] instead of concentrating on our game,"" she says.</p><p>But it was a different story when they went outside the country last fall. Hummel financed a trip to Bangladesh for a match against that country's national team. Suddenly, nobody seemed to care what they were wearing or if their sleeves were pushed up. ""When we went to Bangladesh, it was like flying; we were like birds,"" says Sabra. ""I was jumping, I was running hard, I was playing. I was not afraid of my uncle's son. I thought, This is my time to enjoy.""</p><p><b>The Way Forward</b><br /><br />Until the game against the NATO women's team last fall, the Afghan women's team didn't know what it was like to play in front of a crowd, much less a sympathetic one. Khalida recalls looking up from the field and seeing people smiling and cheering, and she says she felt a rush of energy and wonder. The onlookers were mainly American military, but ""there were lots of Afghans who came to that game,"" says Khalida, referring to the relatives and NATO workers in attendance. ""They were encouraging our team and clapping and waving our flag. When we see the men encouraging girls to play football, that is really nice.""</p><p>A measure of how lonely it is to pursue sports in Afghanistan is how close the women on the team are to one another. A passion for football is their bond, and it's one that few others in their society understand. ""If I expressed what this means to me-well, it is my life,"" says Palwasha. ""It is all I have. Even when I am feeling very sad, I want to come and play.""</p><p>Khalida, who is sitting nearby, nods and adds: ""You see, football is very hard, very difficult. But once you start playing football, you won't stop playing, you can't stop. It becomes part of your life.""</p><p>In America, a multitude of studies point to the advantages women have gained from playing sports at a young age: increased confidence and self-esteem, higher levels of psychological well-being, a more positive body image. It's impossible to know whether the same benefits would come about in Afghanistan's vastly different culture, but if these young women continue to play, perhaps eventually-though it will take a long time-the idea of girls playing sports could become acceptable enough so that the population will see the impact.</p><p>In the meantime, the team hopes to go to Germany and Denmark this summer for games, with financial support from Hummel. All of the players are also determined to find a way to attend soccer camps outside the country and become qualified coaches and referees. Roia would like to see the team somehow get enough money to go outside Afghanistan for more professional coaching and be in a place where they could play every day.</p><p>Zohra plans to become a coach. She is one of a small number of women studying physical education at the Education University in Kabul and one of the two women chosen by the Afghan Football Federation to go to Iran this past spring for a course certified by FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association), the sponsor of the World Cup and the group that governs football leagues worldwide.</p><p>But still, she's torn by the idea of eventually leaving the country. ""Yes, it is easier to go abroad to coach and play, but I don't want to leave. If we don't teach the next generation, if we don't make the future, who will?""</p><p><i><b>Send a note of support to the young women on the Afghan national football team at</b> </i><i><a href=""mailto:%20AfghanWomen@rodale.com""><i>AfghanWomen@rodale.com</i></a>.<br /></i></p>",

Ditch the artificially sweetened juices and sodas and get your fructose from fruit--a form that researchers say could be kinder to your waistline. </p><p><b>G is for Grapefruit</b><br />Kick off every meal with half a ruby red or 8 ounces of grapefruit juice--you could speed up your weight loss. Subjects of a 2006 study in the <i>Journal of Medicinal Food</i> who ate half a grapefruit before each meal lost more weight after 12 weeks than those who didn't (3.5 pounds versus less than a pound). </p><p><b>H is for Hydration</b><br />Studies have shown that drinking water can slightly increase your <a target=""_blank"" href=""/fitness/burn-fat"">caloric burn rate</a>. The researchers behind one such study at Franz-Volhard Clinical Research Center in Berlin estimate that sipping six extra 8-ounce glasses a day can <a target=""_blank"" href=""/fitness/burn-fat"">burn</a> 17,400 more calories (about 5 pounds of fat) per year. </p><p><b>I is for Insulin </b><br />The amount of this sugar-regulating hormone you secrete may dictate the diet you should follow. A study published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> found that high insulin secretors dropped about 13 pounds on a low-carb diet but only about 3 on a low-fat/higher-carb diet. Look in the mirror: If you store fat in your belly (have an ""apple"" body shape), you're more likely to secrete excess insulin and benefit from fewer carbs. </p><p><b>J is for Journal</b><br />If you write down everything you eat, research has shown, you can cut your intake by 500 to 1,000 calories a day. And you'll keep the weight off: <a target=""_blank"" href=""/fitness/workout-logs"">Food journaling</a> is one of the successful behaviors used by people in the National Weight Control Registry, a list of dieters who have maintained a loss of 30 pounds or more for at least one year. </p><p><b>K is for Ketosis </b><br />The point at which your body runs low on carbs and starts burning fat stores for fuel, ketosis can jump-start a diet or bust a plateau. Studies show that dieters who restrict carbs typically lose more weight during the first 3 to 6 months, but after about a year their results are comparable to those who go low-fat. So after dropping those initial pounds, it's okay to have whole-grain pasta and bread again--in moderation. </p><p><b>L is for Leptin</b><br />Fat cells secrete this hormone to tell your brain you're full. But researchers have found that fasts and extremely calorie-restrictive diets can lower leptin levels, prompting you to eat more. To keep this hormone in balance, strive for a slow, steady weight loss--no more than 1 to 2 pounds per week. </p><p><b>M is for Milk</b><br />You might get better results from your workout if you imbibe moo juice. A study in the <i>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</i> found that downing 2 cups of skim milk after intense weight-lifting workouts built more muscle and burned twice as much fat as drinking carbohydrate beverages (such as a sports drink). But go with real cow's milk--in the study, drinks made from soy had no effect. </p><p><b>N is for Numbers</b><br />Nobody enjoys weigh-ins, but research shows that people who hop on the scale once a day are more likely to lose and to maintain their loss.

Bonus: You'll burn about 25 percent of the eggs' calories just by digesting them (protein metabolism uses more energy than that of fat and carbs). A two-egg omelet takes you a quarter of the way to your protein RDA. </p><p><b>P is for Peanuts </b><br />Subjects in a study at Purdue University received about 500 calories' worth of peanuts a day to eat at their discretion. After 8 weeks, they had gained an average of about 2 pounds--much less than the 8 pounds researchers had predicted. Probable cause: The high-protein and high-fiber nuts filled them up. And after 19 weeks, they also had boosted their resting metabolic rates by 11 percent, possibly due to the fatty acids in the nuts. Take the edge off your appetite by snacking on a handful (a quarter-cup) per day. </p><p><b>Q is for Quinoa</b><br />Quinoa (<i>keen-wa</i>) has more hunger-taming protein and fiber and less carbs than most other whole grains. Swap it for white rice and other refined grains. </p><p><b>R is for Replacements</b><br />Researchers at the University of Kansas found that dieters who drank liquid meal replacements lost just as much weight over 52 weeks as those who used the weight-loss drug Orlistat with regular meals. Who needs pills? </p><p><b>S is for Stress</b><br />Scientists at Georgetown University fed two groups of mice a diet of high-fat, high-sugar feed and measured how much weight they gained. Stressed mice (you don't want to know how they pushed them over the edge) gained more than twice as much weight as the group with the same diet but no stress. The reason? Researchers believe that stress causes the release of a molecule that helps increase the size and number of fat cells. The next time you're feeling the strain, do yoga (see Y) instead of dessert. </p><p><b>T is for Tea</b><br />The fat-busting benefits of green tea boil down to disease-fighting compounds called catechins. One study of 240 Japanese men and women found that when subjects drank green tea containing 583 milligrams of catechins per 12-ounce cup, they dropped more weight--and inches--than those who ingested tea containing only 96 milligrams. Max your results by steeping your bag of green tea as long as possible. The darker the hue of your brew (and the more bitter it is), the more catechin-rich the cup. </p><p><b>U is for User-Friendly</b><br />A recent study in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> assigned 160 overweight and obese volunteers to one of four popular diets for 6 months. They found that the strongest predictor of weight loss wasn't the type of diet but compliance with the selected plan. The takeaway: Find a plan you can live with so you'll stick to it (e.g., if you need help controlling portions, try WeightWatchers' Core Plan). </p><p><b>V is for Vinegar</b><br />A study published in the<i> Journal of the American Dietetic Association</i> found that swallowing 60 grams (about 4 tablespoons) of an apple cider vinegar mixture with a high-glycemic-index meal caused test subjects to eat 200 to 275 fewer calories over the rest of the day. If you can't stomach the stuff straight, try mixing it into a low-fat dressing. </p><p><b>W is for Weights</b><br />If you've put off pumping iron, get to it. According to experts, you burn calories faster after a strength-training session than you would after a cardio session. And researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham found that lifting weights three times a week for 25 weeks caused women to lose an average of 4 pounds of body fat. </p><p><b>X is for Xenical</b><br />This prescription fat blocker made news last year when the FDA green­lighted its over-the-counter version, Alli. But both drugs come with an unfortunate side effect: loose stools. We say pass on the gas and slim down the old-fashioned way. </p><p><b>Y is for Yoga</b><br />A study at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle found that normal-weight women who practiced yoga for four or more years gained three pounds less over 10 years than those who didn't.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/pleasure-sex,Sex And Relationships,234,100,88,5,1,0,1,0,,Have Great Sex: Why it's OK to Be a Little Selfish in the Sack,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1011-great-sex-art.jpg,"<p>While women may naturally be the more benevolent gender, when it comes to claiming bedroom bliss, there's good reason to get greedy. A new study conducted by Kwantlen Polytechnic University in British Columbia found that the more you focus on your own pleasure during sex, the more satisfied you and your partner will be. That's right, even he wants you to be selfish in the sack. ""We were pretty surprised because we set out to provide evidence of the opposite,"" says study coauthor Cory L. Pedersen, Ph.D. And other sex experts agree that men get off on seeing their partners reveling in ecstasy.</p><p>It largely comes down to enthusiasm. A woman who has sex because she craves it is going to be really into the experience, says Pedersen. And that enthusiasm appeals to men for two reasons: First, when you take responsibility for your carnal contentment, he doesn't have to worry that you're not enjoying yourself-he can see that you are! And second, the sight of an aroused woman produces more of the sex hormone testosterone in men.</p><p>Still unsure how to claim your fair share? Start with these spine-tingling tips.</p><p><strong>Treat Yourself</strong><br />""From an evolutionary standpoint, the brain's main priorities are survival and sex. So when you're having sex, your brain's pleasure center gets the green light to orgasm when worry (or danger) isn't present. That's why it's important for women to be relaxed if they want to climax,"" says Gert Holstege, Ph.D., a professor of neuroscience at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.</p><p>In one study recently published in the <em>European Journal of Neuroscience</em>, two groups of women had their brains scanned while they watched porn. And wouldn't you know it, the group that was more sexually charged showed lower levels of activity in the left brain, the part in charge of nagging to-do lists (clearly these women weren't thinking about picking up their dry cleaning).</p><p>To relax your mind enough to focus on your pleasure, ask your guy to give you a massage (rubdowns release the feel-good hormone oxytocin, which helps you zone out) or try this mindfulness technique from Louanne Cole Weston, Ph.D., a board-certified sex therapist in Fair Oaks, California: Imagine a ticker tape running in your brain that broadcasts only sexy thoughts. Every time something stressful or mundane enters your mind, address it briefly by saying to yourself, I'll deal with that later, and then allow yourself to flip to the next naughty image on your mental reel. Eventually, you will train yourself to drown out external noise and focus on the bliss your body is receiving.</p><p><strong>Direct Him</strong><br />Every guy has one go-to move in his arsenal that worked wonders on a past partner, so he keeps whipping it out for each new bedmate, hoping to repeat those ego-boosting results. The problem, of course, is that every woman's body responds differently to stimulation. For that reason, you need to tell him what makes your toes curl. ""Don't worry that you're being bossy by telling him exactly what you like,"" says Belisa Vranich, Psy.D., author of <em>He's Got Potential: A Field Guide to Shy Guys, Bad Boys, Intellectuals, Cheaters, and Everything in Between</em>. ""Guys don't mind a little direction in bed. They know you want an orgasm, and they want to give it to you. Plus, it's so much less work for them."" So take his hand, place it on the body part you want to be stroked, and simply say, ""Touch me here.""</p><p><strong>Steal the Spotlight</strong><br />This one might make you cringe, but hear us out: Gazing at yourself in the mirror while you're having sex can increase the heat significantly. In a recent study conducted at the University of Texas at Austin, even women who didn't like their tummies, thighs, or boobs were turned on when they masturbated in front of a mirror. Experts figure that seeing your own naked, aroused body triggers a primal sexual instinct in women. Give it a shot when you're with your guy by propping up a full-length mirror next to the bed so you can both get an eyeful of the action.</p><p><strong>Give Yourself a Hand</strong><br />During intercourse, you probably let you hands wander all over your guy's body. But you might want to try keeping them to yourself, especially during positions such as doggy-style or reverse cowgirl. ""These positions typically stimulate your G-spot and front vaginal walls, so stroking your clitoris-which is neglected in these poses-will double your pleasure,"" says Ian Kerner, Ph.D., author of <em>She Comes First</em>. Or just lie back and touch yourself. Watching you masturbate will make him feel like a voyeur (a big turn-on for guys) and also give him pointers on how you like to be caressed. Everybody wins.</p><p><strong>Don't Interrupt Oral</strong><br />A woman will often stop a guy while he's pleasuring her orally because she assumes he's getting tired or bored. Not such a hot idea. ""Some women report that when they are headed toward orgasm from oral sex and then stop to have intercourse, they can't seem to get the momentum back and the orgasm ends up slipping away for good,"" says Weston.</p><p>Whenever you feel a surge of guilt about how long he's been down there, just remember this: Guys get off on giving you oral. In fact, a recent study published in the <em>International Journal of Sexual Health</em> says that men love the look and taste of their partner's genitals.

Mortification would be the typical go-to response. But if you both knew that <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/you-and-improved/the-science-of-funny"">laughing</a> makes you smarter, more creative, and more productive, you'd tilt the screen her way, turn up the volume, and get your giggles on. <br /><br /><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/samantha-bee-interview"">Laughter</a>, it turns out, nearly rivals exercise when it comes to <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/the-benefits-of-cinnamon"">health benefits</a> and brain-boosting powers. For starters, a Loma Linda University study found that it raised levels of disease-fighting immunoglobulins by 14 percent. Another at UCLA discovered that kids could endure having their hands submerged in ice water 40 percent longer while watching comedies (find out more about new ways to manage pain on page 128). And a cardiologist at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore measured subjects' blood flow as they watched <i>There's Something About Mary</i> and concluded that laughter increases circulation about as much as a treadmill session. Need more reasons to go out and buy season two of <i>The Office</i>? Keep reading.<br /><br /><b>Your Brain on Borat</b><br /><br />Beyond the physical perks, a few guffaws can sharpen your thinking. Ron Berk, Ph.D., a recently retired psychologist from Johns Hopkins Medical School, started using jokes and gags back in 1993 to combat his students' lectureinduced narcolepsy. He soon noticed that his one-liners did more than keep them awake; they caused a spike in their test scores. To prove it, he and a colleague divided 98 students in a graduate biostatistics class (yaaaawn...) into two groups. Each took the same 57-item exam, but one group's test had funny instructions. As the two researchers reported last October in the scientific journal <i>Humor</i>, the students who got a dose of silliness scored significantly higher on the exam. <br /><br />The results of that experiment probably didn't surprise one school of brainiacs: positive psychologists. Unlike traditional psychologists, who focus on negative emotions such as fear and anger, these guys research desirable feelings like happiness and satisfaction. Until the past decade or so, scientists knew astonishingly little about the benefits of feeling good. In the late 1990s, Barbara Fredrickson, Ph.D., a psychologist at the University of North Carolina, came up with a theory: A positive state of mind - whether caused by humor, love, or contentment - broadens people's thinking and ability to adapt to changing circumstances. <br /><br />An experiment with penguins illustrates the point. In a 2005 study, Fredrickson showed 104 undergraduates a 2-minute video of waddling penguins that only a major scrooge could fail to find funny. An equal number of students watched an abstract video of, er, colored lines, which left them predictably unmoved. Then Fredrickson tested the students for big-picture thinking by showing them four small triangles arranged as a square or three small squares arranged as a triangle. Amused subjects were significantly more likely to focus on the overall pattern rather than the component shapes: They were better able to see the big picture, literally. <br /><br />In a separate experiment, students were asked to watch the penguins and list up to 20 things they'd like to do at that moment (explore the Arctic, sip margaritas, lasso wild horses...). The people who had watched the goofy film thought of more things to do, which indicates more flexible and creative thinking. <br /><br />How does humor help us think? Scientists are pretty sure it has to do with the way amusement stimulates the brain's reward center. In a landmark 2003 study at Stanford, researchers put subjects in MRI machines and showed them <i>Bizarro</i> cartoons. When they got a joke, a midbrain area known as the nucleus accumbens became active. The nucleus accumbens is part of a neural pathway that scientists call a reward circuit, the same one that's triggered when we eat chocolate or have sex. There's evidence that this circuit pumps out dopamine, a brain-signaling chemical that stimulates the frontal lobe - the place where we do most of our mental heavy lifting. So humor and other positive feelings effectively fuel our noodle.<br /><br /><b>Be Amused, Be Very Amused</b><br /><br />Obviously, people totally lacking in humor (Dick Cheney comes to mind) aren't going to be the life of the party. But it's amazing what a little kidding can do for your social life. Consider that jelly-bellied Jack Black scores leading roles opposite the likes of Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet or that beady-eyed Vince Vaughn got a shot at Jennifer Aniston. Making chicks laugh can transform so-so guys into studs - and we have more than celeb examples to back that up. Last year, researchers at McMaster University in Ontario had more than 200 college students examine photos of members of the opposite sex accompanied by either funny or bland quotes. Women rated the funny men as more attractive. But while guys said they preferred a woman with a good sense of humor, they didn't actually find the funny females foxier. These egomaniacs did, however, rate women who found them funny as more attractive. <br /><br />Off the meet market, goofing around can help you warm up to a new bud. In 2000, Arthur Aron, Ph.D., a social psychologist at State University of New York at Stony Brook, separated 96 undergraduates into same-sex pairs and had one teach the other dance moves. In half of the pairs, the ""teacher"" held a straw in her teeth, which garbled her speech, and the ""student"" was blindfolded. Sounds more like S&M than science, but never mind that. The shenanigans elicited plenty of giggles, and the pairs who laughed together reported feeling closer afterward than those who took the exercise seriously. <br /><br />According to Aron, humor softens us up by distracting us from the anxiety we feel when meeting someone new and by creating the sensation of something exciting, which makes the experience more pleasurable. Experts also believe that people who can see the funny side of a situation have a greater level of ""emotional intelligence"" - the ability to manage their own emotions and accurately read another person's. In a 2006 study, Rod Martin, Ph.D., professor of clinical psychology at the University of Western Ontario and president of the International Society for Humor Studies, gave students questionnaires to measure their sense of humor, then had them analyze the emotions of faces on a computer screen. The upshot: People who joke around more often tend to read other people better. Not surprising when you consider that humor usually involves addressing touchy subjects in a way that's provocative but not upsetting, e.g., making LemonAIDS.<br /><br />Silly skills score points at work too. Fabio Sala, Ph.D., an organizational psychologist at Boston University, analyzed audiotapes of 20 male executives. The execs rated ""outstanding"" by their staff used humor - by either cracking jokes or cracking up - more than twice as often as those rated ""average.""<br /><br />Whether at home, on the dating scene, or in the office, humor works kind of like a couple of martinis - only better. It greases the social wheels by reducing stress and putting people at ease. And luckily, you don't have to be as funny as Sarah Silverman to reap the benefits. All you have to do is laugh. <br />",You and Improved

Not necessarily. Friday used to mean you were facing a weekend of fun and relaxation, but now those two bliss-filled days have become a lot less, well, bliss filled, thanks to a laundry list of chores, take-home work, and a jam-packed social calendar.<br /><br /><br /><br />A bummer, to be sure, but cramming your life full of endless obligations is also a health hazard: Studies show that when you shift gears, you can actually make yourself sick, likely because you're throwing off your body's natural rhythm, which can mess with <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.whdailyfix.com/?keycode=142693"">your physical well-being</a>. In the journal Psychological Topics, clinical psychology professor Ad Vingerhoets, Ph.D., calls this modern malady ""leisure sickness.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Inability to Unplug</b><br /><br />Here's what's happening: Your body churns out adrenaline, often in response to work demands, but nowadays the flow of that energy-producing hormone isn't stemmed come Friday night. And the continuous release of adrenaline when you don't need it (i.e., during downtime) can create a ""physiological disturbance that puts you at risk for developing fatigue and headaches,"" says Vingerhoets. Also, staying plugged in after you clock out is one of the reasons sleep problems have become a monster issue affecting some 70 million Americans, according to the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research at the National Institutes of Health.<br /><br /><br /><br />And because the average woman works nine hours more each week than she did in 2004, according to data collected last year by the Center for Work-Life Policy, more of the domestic to-do list-sorting laundry, shopping for groceries, plowing through piles of bills-is saved for the weekend.<br /><br /><br /><br />""We run our lives like seven-day workweeks because we think we can use our weekend time to catch up,"" says psychologist Rachna Jain, Psy.D., ""but it's exhausting."" That might explain why Monday is often not the most productive workday, according to Accountemps, a staffing firm that maximizes productivity. ""If the highs of stress during the week aren't offset by the lows of leisure on the weekend, your cortisol levels can remain sky-high, hampering your body's natural ability to bounce back and recharge,"" says Stephanie McClellan, M.D., coauthor of So Stressed: The Ultimate Stress-Relief Plan for Women. ""Too much cortisol can even accelerate aging."" (Bet that got your attention!) And chronic stress can lead to high blood pressure and heart disease, as well as anxiety and depression.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Decisions, Decisions</b><br /><br />Another reason weekends tend to wipe us out: They're not as structured as weekdays, where tasks are laid out for us. ""Most people aren't prepared to function with free time,"" says Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Ph.D., codirector of the Quality of Life Research Center at Claremont Graduate University in California. ""We end up being overwhelmed with a sense that we need to fill each minute with quality stuff. We often end up wasting our days by not doing anything interesting, rather than planning things that produce happiness.""<br /><br /><br /><br />So how do you go about making the most of your days off? According to McClellan, it's all about ""balancing times of exertion with times of quiet and leisure."" We asked some experts to offer up their smartest tricks for restoring the replenishing power of the weekend.<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Think ahead...way ahead.</b> </p><p>Plan each weekend by the end of the weekend before, says productivity expert Julie Morgenstern, author of Never Check E-mail in the Morning. ""One survey found that nearly half of us wait until Thursday night to make plans,"" she says. By that time, friends are busy, shows are booked, and you're looking at a weekend spent in front of the flat-screen, watching reality-TV reruns on Bravo. ""Plus,"" notes Morgenstern, ""a big part of the joy of leisure time is anticipation.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Get it done.</b> <br /><br />""Friday evening we're still in work mode, which makes doing chores more seamless and less painful,"" says McClellan. Check one thing off your to-do list during this time, like running to the post office for stamps.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Follow the rule of three.</b> <br /><br />""That's exactly how many planned activities you should schedule for the weekend-for example, hitting a flea market, going out to dinner, and carving out some time alone to immerse yourself in a juicy best seller,"" suggests Laura Vanderkam, author of 168 Hours: You Have More Time Than You Think. ""You'll get the right amount of meaningful activities, but still have plenty of time for spontaneous fun.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Go with the flow.</b> <br /><br />Make the most of your leisure time with something that Csikszentmihalyi describes as flow. ""This is an almost childlike state in which you're so lost in an activity that you don't think about how you look or what you're achieving-and you move away from your problems or anxiety about work."" Diving into something creative (whether it's painting, knitting, writing, or <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.whdailyfix.com/?keycode=142693"">trying a new recipe</a>) will stimulate your mind and make it easier to enter escape mode.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Set a chore deadline.</b> <br /><br />Before starting a string of tasks, think about which ones are absolutely necessary and which can be pushed into the future to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.whdailyfix.com/?keycode=142693"">make room for fun</a>. Ask yourself, Will my world implode if my clothes stay at the dry cleaner a few extra days? Obvious answer: No. When you're starting your tasks, set an alarm for a designated amount of time. When it goes off, ""stop what you're doing and push everything else to next week,"" suggests life coach Christine Hassler, author of 20 Something Manifesto.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Take a technical time-out.</b> <br /><br />Easier said than done, but limiting how often you check your mobile is a must if you want to decompress. ""Keeping up with messages may not take a huge amount of time, but it leaves you in a stressed-out work mode-even when you're not yakking it up,"" says Vanderkam.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Aim for ""good enough.""</b> <br /><br />Give those perfectionist tendencies a rest. ""Perhaps you can't see everyone you'd hoped to see over the weekend, but you can e-mail a friend to say you're thinking of her,"" says stress expert Claire Wheeler, M.D., Ph.D., an instructor at Portland State University in Oregon. Maybe you can't cook all meals from scratch, but you can make a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.whdailyfix.com/?keycode=142693"">healthy breakfast</a>...and then order in for dinner.<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p>",

Water. Fatigue is, after all, one of the first signs of dehydration. Even a small drop in your body's water levels can hurt you. A recent study from Tufts University found that mild dehydration -- a loss of just 1 to 2 percent of body weight as water -- was enough to impair thinking. If it turns into full-blown dehydration, it could cause an imbalance in electrolytes like sodium and potassium, which aid muscles and heart function.<br /><br />How much H2O you need depends on your activity level (1 to 1 1/2 cups every 15 minutes while working out) and where you live (you lose more fluids in heat and humidity and at high altitudes). The National Academy of Sciences suggests that women consume 11 cups of fluid every day -- though not all of this has to be water. About 8 cups can come from other drinks (including coffee and tea; <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/the-benefits-of-coffee"">caffeine</a> isn't dehydrating as was once thought) and the rest from what you eat.

No, not the odd cheese-curls-for-dinner days. We mean the average 400 calories a day you suck down through a straw. A recent study in the <em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> showed that around 37 percent of our total daily liquid calories come from sugar-sweetened drinks. And here's the really crazy part: Guzzling those beverages has a bigger impact on our waistlines than anything else we eat.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p><p>""People don't reduce food intake when they drink their calories from soda and other beverages,"" says Barry Popkin, Ph.D., a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina. The silver lining is that cutting back on those <a target=""_self"" href=""/nutrition/how-sugar-harms-you"">oversweetened</a> fluids can be <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/set/?keycode=142686"">an easy way to kick-start weight loss</a>. Where to begin? This guide is a good place.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p><p><strong>Drink These Freely</strong></p><p><br /><em><strong>Tea</strong></em> We may live in the land of the Big Gulp, but for the rest of the world, tea is the most popular beverage after water. And for good reason: Hot or cold, it's calorie-free, and studies have found that compounds in green tea known as catechins rev your metabolism for up to 24 hours-meaning it actually helps you burn more calories. <br /><br /><br /></p><p>But when you load this naturally good beverage with <a target=""_self"" href=""nutrition/how-sugar-harms-you"">sugar</a>, you detract from those health benefits. So order unsweetened when you can, and check labels: Every four grams of sugar is the same as one cube or packetful. If you're up for brewing your own, try this recipe for iced cucumber green tea, from Maggie Moon, M.S., R.D., of the U.S. Tea Council. Boil a quart of cold water, then let it cool for 10 minutes before adding eight to 10 green-tea bags. This will extract the flavor and antioxidants without scorching the tea, which can make it bitter. Steep for one minute, then remove the bags. Peel and dice a cucumber, reserving eight to 10 slices for garnish. Peel and grate one tablespoon of fresh ginger. Distribute cucumber and ginger evenly among four glasses with ice. Top each with eight ounces of tea and garnish with cucumber slices.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p><p><em><strong>Coffee</strong></em> Like tea, unsweetened coffee is filled with healthy compounds and almost no calories. But if you're a fan of sugary coffee concoctions, you down 206 more calories a day on average than people who sip straight joe. Not ready to break up with your barista? Try an Americano (espresso plus water) or a café au lait with skim milk. If you can't skip cream and sugar, be stingy with them or use low-cal or fat-free versions.<br /><br /><br /></p><p></p><p><strong>Go Easier On These</strong></p><p><br /><em><strong>Milk</strong></em> Researchers at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville found that having three servings of low-fat dairy per day can lead to weight loss of 10 percent or more. Dairy contains calcium and the amino acid leucine, which together promote fat burning, says Michael Zemel, Ph.D., director of the university's Nutrition Institute. And a study of overweight women at Northern Illinois University found that soy milk was just as effective as nonfat cow's milk in helping them shed pounds. But stick to skim or low-fat moo juice and light soy milk; otherwise, the calories add up quickly.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p><p><em><strong>Alcohol</strong></em> Happy hour is good for plenty of things, but <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/set/?keycode=142686"">weight loss</a> isn't one of them. Savoring a drink every now and then does have perks, including reducing your risk of heart disease, but alcohol packs a lot of calories into a small glass, and it may even stimulate your appetite. And unlike the calories in fat, carbohydrates, and protein, those in alcohol can't be stored in your body, so they have to be used immediately. As a result, your body stops burning fat until the alcohol is processed-that's roughly an hour for every drink. Most wines ring in between 100 and 120 calories a glass, but you can stretch it out by adding club soda and ice to make a spritzer. If you can't stomach that, have a Bloody Mary-a six-ounce glass delivers around 76 calories. That's reasonable.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p><p><em><strong>Juice</strong></em> If it comes from fruit, it must be healthy, right? Not so much. Many juices have added sugars. And in terms of health benefits, you're always better off eating whole fruit instead. A medium orange has a mere 59 calories, and its 12 grams of sugar come with three grams of belly-­filling fiber. A typical eight-ounce glass of OJ has 110 calories, twice as much sugar as the fruit, and no fiber. For a healthier juice fix, try watering it down, says Lisa Jones, R.D., adjunct professor of nutrition at La Salle University in Philadelphia. Mix four ounces of your favorite kind with 32 ounces of water. You'll get the flavor with fewer calories.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p><p><em><strong>Diet soda</strong></em> No-cal pop may not pile on the pounds directly, but new research from Purdue University suggests that drinking these artificially sweetened beverages can screw with the brain's ability to measure caloric intake. Drink them often enough and you may actually start to crave sweets more. Plus, if you swig diet drinks all day, you're taking in fewer healthy liquids, such as tea. Get your carbonation fix with zero-calorie seltzer instead, or make your own with a home soda maker that carbonates your drink of choice.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>",Better Sex

But before he soars to seismic levels, slow down and show him the softer side of sex. Then you can both indulge in the aftershocks. <br /><br /><b>Connect the Dots </b><br />As in all of the <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/files/please-your-man/index.html"">erogenous zones</a> throughout his body. There's a whole geography of arousal out there, all connected by a sea of sensitive nerve endings. Don't limit yourself to just his penis; instead, hit a variety of sex zones - his nipples, earlobes, or perenium (the sensitive area between the base of his testicles and his anus) - and light him up like a power grid. <br /><br /><b>Hit His Plateau</b> <br />Male sexual response consists of four phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and refractory (when he rolls over afterwards). Most guys take the faster-than-a-speeding-bullet approach and crash through to orgasm, missing out on all of the pleasures that come earlier in the plot - particularly the plateau just before orgasm. Turn your Superman into Multiple Man: Stimulate him orally or manually, count to 10, and then stop. Now squeeze the head of his <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/test-your-penis-knowledge"">penis</a> for 5 seconds. This forces the blood back down and delays orgasm. You'll help him enjoy the sensations of orgasm without him actually ejaculating.<br /><br /><b>Send Him Shopping</b> <br />The truth is that men enjoy foreplay as much as women. But it should be more than just French kissing and a little heavy petting. Spark your imagination, create a sense of anticipation, and take your foreplay out of the bedroom. Send him out shopping for lingerie or, better yet, a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/how-to-host-a-pleasure-party"">sex toy</a>. Call him in the middle of the day and tell him to come home with the accessory of his choice. Then expect him home early. <br /><br /><b>Take Charge</b> <br />Men get tired of always taking the lead, having to know it all, and worrying about their performance. Sometimes, they just want to let go and submit to pleasure. Being dominated is a major male fantasy. Try this stealth dominatrix sex position: Sit cross-legged on the bed while he faces you sitting on top - his legs wrapped around you and his butt firmly nestled between your legs.

I'm naturally very tight in lower back and my hips and hamstrings too. My first class felt like someone was ripping my body apart. It wasn't what you'd call peaceful. But I was excited by the idea that the more dedicated I became the more effortless it would become to relax and give in to that tightness. Yes, the torture subsided a bit over time. <br /><br /><b>How did your body change?</b><br />Physically I have always been on the slender side. When I started practicing I instantly felt more sculpted. Yoga carves you into a different person-and that is satisfying physically. <br /><br /><b>Did it change how you work out?</b><br />I had been lifting weights for years. After our first yoga session, I vowed never to lift another weight again. <br /><br /><b>Do you believe in the mind-body connection?</b><br />I was skeptical, to say the least. I was wary of the cliche´s associated with yoga: spirituality used as a marketing tool or Eastern philosophy sold at Starbucks to disenchanted lawyers and accountants looking for meaning. What I soon realized is that yoga welcomes everyone-that's extremely appealing. <br /><br /><b>How do you maintain your practice on tour?</b><br />Being a traveler, yoga is by far the most convenient way to exercise while I'm on the road. You don't need anything but a few feet of space and a mat. And I can always find at least an hour a day to practice.(Levine made videos with his teacher to take on the road with him.) <br /><br /><b>What is your advice to people who think they are too inflexible to do yoga?</b><br />Start simple. Yoga will drastically improve you in every way imaginable. But let's face it, I only practice yoga because the classes are always packed with beautiful women. (I am totally kidding.) <br /><br /><b>The Yoga Teacher's Report</b><br />Adam was so tight when we started to work together that he would actually roll back if he was sitting. Shortly after he learned Warrior 1 and 2 he noticed a difference in the way his body performed. <br /><br />His spine is curved-it's a genetic thing--so we've kind of incorporated moves to loosen up his spine. Too much lower body and abdominal work would actually hurt him because he's slightly bound in the lower back. We do a lot of dog-cat tilts and do a lot of Warriors, to stretch his legs and relax his lower back. <br /><br />I can tell you, Adam has the same intensity in yoga as he does in a music video. We work every day when he's at home. He even hired a camera crew to videotape one of our sessions so he could watch the DVD in hotel rooms across the country. He's so excited about it. He'll call from the road and ask, 'Do I need a block? Do I need a strap? <br /><br />He even creates a new playlist for each session. I'm usually the girl who brings the good mixes and they're nothing compared to his. But we do have the same taste in music. We like Alicia Keyes, Maxwell, Marvin Gaye, Amy Winehouse. <br /><br />I've seen him with his friends and his girlfriend and he so wants things to be right. Men tend to have a hard time expressing how they feel but he's so passionate and well spoken. But with some yoga they can be like Sting. <br /><br />Adam is really focused; he's really persistent; he's a good man. He lives yoga. <br /><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/yoga/yoga-poses-for-back-pain""><b>Get Adam Levine's back pain workout</b></a><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/maroon-5-adam-levine-yoga-playlist""><b>Get Adam Levine's yoga playlist</b></a><br />",Fix It

""The relationships we invest in the most, regardless of how long we were in them or how long ago they happened, are the ones that have the biggest impact on us,"" says Terri Orbuch, Ph.D., a research professor at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan and author of <em>5 Simple Steps to Take Your Marriage from Good to Great</em>. ""And if things went awry in those relationships, we often carry the anger or insecurity into our subsequent romances.""<br /><br />So how do you prevent the past from coming back to haunt you? Claim your baggage by coming clean to your current mate (sparing him the dirty details, of course). According to a study published in the <em>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</em>, people experienced a heightened sense of intimacy after revealing personal info, such as their previous <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/relationships"">relationship problems</a>, and felt more valued and supported. Forge ahead by following this advice.</p><p><strong>Your Partner Cheated on You</strong><br />Almost anything your guy does that's not completely straightforward will evoke feelings of distrust, explains JoAnn Magdoff, Ph.D., a psychotherapist in New York City. People who were cheated on in the past may find themselves setting traps and checking on their new partner, asking them questions they know the answers to, and assuming their partner is lying. You may end up jumping down his throat and accusing him of things he didn't do, which may understandably infuriate him and ultimately threaten your union, says psychologist Christie Hartman, Ph.D., author of <em>It's Not Him, It's You: The Truth You May Not Want but Need to Hear</em>. </p><p><strong>Unload it:</strong> Make it clear that while your trust issues have nothing to do with him, you equate his vagueness with being lied to. ""Tell him that because of your past, you assume the worst when he's unclear,"" says Magdoff, and that keeping you in the loop and being specific will go a long way toward helping you feel more connected and secure. This will translate into more happiness for you both. </p><p><strong>Your Last Guy Had a Bad Temper</strong><br />Anyone who's dated a yeller and screamer is going to want to avoid confrontation in a subsequent relationship because they're scared of a nasty fight breaking out. But anger is a necessary emotion, and both parties need to be able to express it appropriately. </p><p>""Instead of understanding that conflict is an important part of all relationships, someone who had an angry partner might see disagreements as a sign the relationship is headed for trouble,"" says Orbuch. </p><p><strong>Unload it:</strong> Accept your anger-and his. ""What's important is how you disagree, not whether you disagree,"" says Orbuch. Rather than recoiling or biting your tongue during a disagreement, step back and take a break. Sweat away the anger (and clear your head) on a run, or agree to take a 10-minute walk around the block and then regroup. This will defuse some of the hostility, giving you a more comfortable environment to air your grievances. </p><p><strong>Your Ex Criticized Your Looks</strong><br />It's easy to understand how someone who was called ugly or fat-assed by an ex might have trouble accepting a new dude's compliments. Because romantic relationships carry such powerful meaning and weight-and because a romantic partner sees you without your clothes on-criticism within the context of intimacy can be particularly damaging, explains Thomas Bradbury, Ph.D., codirector of the Relationship Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles. ""Even the most confident people can feel a painful twinge if an intimate partner criticizes their appearance. These comments can cut you to the core,"" he says. If a past partner made disparaging remarks about your weight, you may feel uncomfortable eating in front of your new man or showing off your body, which may cause you to avoid sex and intimacy altogether, says Orbuch. </p><p><strong>Unload it:</strong> Know that your ex's slams were much more about him than you. ""Anyone who insults or criticizes a partner in this way is massively insecure and is making a desperate attempt to cover up a deep sense of inferiority,"" says Hartman. Translation: He may not have thought those things about you but felt compelled to cut you down to prop himself up. To make sure you take your new guy's loving words to heart, stop yourself from dismissing his praise and affection. ""There's only one way to handle a compliment: Say thank you, and mean it,"" says Hartman. ""After a while, the kind words will sink in."" </p><p><strong>You Dated a Partyer</strong><br />Because your last boyfriend left you high and dry to booze it up with his buddies, you may become clingy, bossy, or prone to nagging your new guy-in other words, a pretty big buzzkill. You could even become a teetotaler, choosing to avoid parties and any social scenario where alcohol is involved because of your ex and his habits, says Orbuch. </p><p><strong>Unload it:</strong> Before you bust out the at-home Breathalyzer, take a moment to analyze the situation rationally. How many times did he go out this week? Two? And where was he the other nights? With you? Sounds like a guy who has his priorities straight. </p><p>And remind yourself that a person who likes to go out and party with his friends doesn't necessarily have a problem, says Magdoff. In fact, it's totally normal behavior, provided it doesn't happen all the time and he's not coming home and passing out on the bathroom floor on a regular basis.</p>",
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/healthy-deli-meats,Nutrition,64,86,10,33,0,27,4,0,,Decoding the Deli Counter,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/deli-counter-art.jpg,"<p>The number one deli order is turkey, and there's nothing wrong with that-except that it gets old fast. ""Fresh turkey is healthy, but the deli can be a one-stop shop of delicious, health-conscious options,"" says Keri Gans, R.D., author of The Small Change Diet. If you're wary of sodium, nitrates, and other dangers you've heard about, read on to learn the best choices for your body.</p><p><strong>Not All Cuts Are Created Equal</strong><br />Sliced whole roasted ham, turkey, and pot roast are known in deli-speak as ""whole cuts."" Far more common, though, are processed meats, which tend to be fattier and are made by adding preservatives (mostly salt) and sometimes fillers (anything from meat by-products to corn syrup) to ground meat. You can usually recognize processed meats by their unnaturally uniform shape-the better to fit on a bun, says Jan Novakofski, Ph.D., a professor of nutritional science in the meat science laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The best way to make sure you're getting a whole cut is to ask for it.</p><p><strong>Food Safety First</strong><br />If last August's recall of 380,000 pounds of deli meat has you worried about Listeria, relax. This invisible food-borne bacteria isn't common, and even if it is ingested, it's rarely deadly unless your immune system is already compromised (pregnant women are advised to steer clear of eating cold cuts, because Listeria can affect the developing fetus). If you're iffy about an order, try this trick from Mindy Brashears, Ph.D., director of the International Center for Food Industry Excellence at Texas Tech University:</p><p>""When you get home, microwave the meat until it's steaming (a temperature of about 165°F) before putting it away in the refrigerator.""</p><p><strong>Nitrate Dangers Are No Baloney</strong><br />A study in the journal <em>Circulation</em> found that a daily dose of 50 grams (about two slices) of processed red meats such as bologna and salami increases heart-disease risk by 42 percent and diabetes risk by 19 percent. Processed red meats typically contain nitrates, chemicals that are added for flavor and color (and not just to red meats-cured meats, including smoked turkey, may also have them). The study findings suggest that high amounts of nitrates (and sodium) may explain the higher risk of heart attacks and diabetes, says lead study author Renata Micha, Ph.D., R.D. Worse, researchers have discovered that when sodium and nitrates combine with the digestive juices in the stomach, they can turn into carcinogenic compounds and have been linked to several types of cancer.</p><p>But this doesn't mean you can never have another pastrami on rye-just make sure it's loaded with greens.</p><p>""Some studies show that the antioxidants in vegetables may prevent nitrates from converting into cancer-causing compounds,"" says Rebecca Scritchfield, a registered dietitian in Washington, D.C.</p><p>""Stuff your sandwich with lots of veggies, not just lettuce. Spinach, alfalfa, and tomatoes are all high in antioxidants and nutrients and low in calories.""</p><p><strong>Low-Sodium Doesn't Have to Mean Low Taste</strong><br />Surprise-some sandwiches can pack 150 percent of your RDA of sodium (usually those that are stuffed with processed red meats such as salami and pepperoni; they have an average of four times the sodium of whole cuts). Low-sodium meats and cheeses slash salt by anywhere from 30 to 85 percent. When going low-sodium, pick a meat or cheese you don't normally eat, says Marjorie Nolan, a registered dietitian in New York. That way, your taste buds won't be expecting the same flavor. And choose a variety with herbs or spices, like chipotle chicken or peppered roast beef, so you don't miss the salt.</p><p><strong>Choose Your Cheese Wisely</strong><br />Swiss has 83 percent less sodium than American cheese, and more calcium-about 25 percent of the recommended daily value, says Gans. And although no regular cheese can claim to be low-fat, mozzarella is the best one for your bod, with about six grams of fat per ounce. Ask for your order to be sliced thin-not only will you save calories, but thin cheese slices are a better choice for hot sandwiches.</p><p>""Their lower density helps them melt better,"" says Cathy Strange, global cheese buyer for Whole Foods Market.</p><p><strong>Avoid Shiny Sides</strong><br />When the veggies in deli salads are slick and glistening, it's usually a good sign that they've been bathed in high-calorie oil. Instead, go for a cucumber salad or mayo-free coleslaw, says Gans. And don't eat straight from the deli dish: ""A container is not necessarily a serving size,"" she says. ""It can be tightly packed, and what looks like a quarter pound may actually be half a pound.""</p>",

Hello, <i>chaturanga</i>. </p><p>This classic yoga <a href=""/fitness-8"">arm-strengthening</a> move requires you to ""move and lift your own body weight with grace,'' says Michael Lechonczak, cofounder of Intelligent Yoga in New York City. That's tougher than you might think. There's no flopping to the floor and grunting from the ground up like you may have done in junior high gym class. Yoga pushups are meant to be done slowly, in a controlled manner, in sync with your breath. You'll challenge your muscles and get ripped as a result. </p><p><b>Warm-up:<br /></b><b>Downward-facing dog pose (adho mukha svanasana)</b><b>, variation</b><br />Start in <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/downward-facing-dog-pose""><b>downward-facing dog</b></a>, then create an air pocket under your palms by cupping your hands on the mat instead of placing them flat.

(In a class use this variation in every <b>down dog</b> after you are warmed up.)

The goal here is to look like an alligator, with your whole body in one lean line. Important: ""Your belly isn't hanging down like a broken mule,'' Lechonczak says, choosing another unattractive animal analogy. ""Every muscle in the body is engaged and working in concert. You're one solid, integrated slab, with the legs, back muscles, and abdominals all firing like crazy."" Don't try to do 50 of these biceps builders. Do 5 or 10 high-quality reps, each one better than the previous one.</p><p><b>Extra Credit: <br />Reverse </b><b>chaturanga</b><br />Lie facedown.

""My mind would just race,"" she says. ""I'd be like, 'Tomorrow: Do I need to bring my lunch, should I buy it at school, should I bring my laptop with me?'"" <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/sleep-better-0"">Exhausted, she felt fuzzy</a> and irritable during the day. <br /><br /><b>The Solution </b><br />Nelson started going to bed 2 hours later, while forcing herself to rise at her regular time. You'd think this practice - known as <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/sleep-myths"">sleep</a> restriction - would only make her more tired. And in the short run, it did. But it also meant that she fell asleep faster and slept more deeply. ""It squashes all the sleep into one block of time,"" says Edward Stepanski, Ph.D., director of the <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/best-pillows"">sleep disorders</a> center at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. ""Once we've improved the quality, we work on the quantity."" Nelson gradually shifted her bedtime earlier until she was getting 7 hours straight.<br /><br />Nelson never naps or sleeps past 8 A.M. In bed she relaxes by sequentially tensing and releasing muscles in her arms, legs, shoulders, and face. ""Now when a thought comes into my head I say, 'Oh, I had a thought.' I taught myself to just take them as they come,"" she says. ""Since I started this, I have never felt better. I don't get as frustrated or upset about things as I used to."" <br /><br /><b>The Overdoer</b><br /><br /><b>The Woman</b><br />Pamela Bolanis, 30, senior vice president in sales at Wachovia Securities in Richmond, Virginia<br /><br /><b>The Problem</b>Spending too little time in bed. <br />A six-time marathoner and mother of a 1-year-old, Bolanis is at the office by 7:30 A.M. and often out with clients until 10 P.M. Although she needs 81/2 hours of sleep, she gets more like 6, rising early to spend time with her son. She drinks half a pot of coffee every morning but finds that her concentration and memory are impaired. ""Sleep is so important,"" she says, ""but with my current state of affairs, something has got to give.""<br /><br /><b>The Solution </b><br />There is no medical treatment for people who are too busy to sleep. Experts say they simply need to make different choices. Eric Olson, M.D., codirector of the Mayo Sleep Disorders Center in Rochester, Minnesota, recommends sleeping in on weekends and taking strategic naps (note: these are verboten for insomniacs because they can make it harder to fall asleep at night). Joyce Walsleben, Ph.D., a psychologist at New York University's Sleep Disorders Center, suggests that overextended people start going to bed consistently 15 minutes earlier. After a week or two, they should move bedtime up another quarter hour. ""Nobody can argue they can't give 15 minutes a night,"" she says.<br /><br /><b>The Night Owl</b><br /><br /><b>The Woman</b><br />Jennifer Weihs, 21, occupational therapy student at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska<br /><br /><b>The Problem</b> Biological clock needs resetting. <br />The biological clock is the part of the brain that ensures that we feel tired at night and alert during the day. Darkness directs the clock to start producing the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin. Weihs's body releases melatonin later than normal, making her a born night owl. She had trouble falling asleep, especially before midnight, and mornings were torture. Her roommates literally had to shake her or she'd miss class. ""I never woke up and felt rested,"" she says. Weihs's disorder, called delayed sleep phase syndrome, is related to jet lag and the problems experienced by people who work the night shift.<br /><br /><b>The Solution </b><br />Weihs started taking melatonin every night at 8 P.M., and immediately found she could fall asleep earlier. She also started forcing herself awake at 9 A.M. to sit for half an hour in front of a light box - a device that uses a fluorescent bulb to mimic the sun's intensity.

But there's plenty more lame summertime advice that you might still believe. We set the record straight.</p><p><strong>MYTH: Peeing on a jellyfish sting will ease the pain.</strong><br />Though it may sound convenient-if also totally gross!-urine hasn't been proven to curb the hurt. What has: vinegar. ""Its acidity is believed to inactivate the stingers and diminish the pain,"" says Stanford University School of Medicine emergency-medicine doctor Paul Auerbach, M.D., author of <em>Medicine for the Outdoors</em>. Soak a paper towel in household white vinegar and hold it on the wound for about 30 minutes. Afterward, use an OTC hydrocortisone cream to quell any itching. (If, however, you start to feel dizzy or nauseated or develop any kind of rash, you may be having an allergic reaction and should get yourself to a doctor right away, says Auerbach.)</p><p><strong>MYTH: Going in and out of air-conditioned buildings can make you sick.</strong><br />If you feel congested or start sniffling, it's likely due to summer allergies, says pulmonologist Neil Schachter, M.D., author of <em>The Good Doctor's Guide to Colds and Flu</em>.</p><p>""People who have allergies-even small sensitivities-may be affected when moving from a clean-air environment into one that's full of Mother Nature's irritants,"" he says. If your symptoms are on overdrive, try staying inside on very hot, humid days, when outdoor allergens are at their most potent. And keep your home dust-and mold-free by cleaning your AC filter every month or by investing in a HEPA air purifier that nixes 99 percent of airborne contaminants.</p><p><strong>MYTH: The safest place to be during a lightning storm is in a car because it has rubber tires.</strong><br />You'll be safe in a car, but not because of the rubber tires, says John Jensenius, a lightning-safety specialist for the National Weather Service. The car's frame is like a metal cage-if struck, lightning will flow around its outside.</p><p>(Metal is a good conductor of electricity; rubber is not.) If you're driving in a storm, don't touch metal door handles or the radio, which is wired to the outside antenna.</p><p><strong>MYTH: Flip-flops are kind to your feet.</strong><br />""Most flip-flops don't have adequate arch support, cushioning, or shock absorption,"" says Manhattan-based foot doctor Jacqueline Sutera, D.P.M. Wearing them all summer, every summer could lead to pinched foot nerves, heel pain, tendinitis, and strained arches. If you can't quit flops entirely, buy ones that have at least a three-quarter-inch semi-cushioned sole and built-in arch support. Even better, go for a strappy sandal; simple thongs force your toes into an unhealthy clenched position when you walk, encouraging hammertoe growth. Or try cute, beachy wedges (three inches high or less), which offer more support in just about every foot area and help distribute your body weight more evenly (see page 60 for chic summer options).</p><p><strong>MYTH: A dip in the pool can do double duty as a shower.</strong><br />Consider this: Most people don't rinse off before they go swimming. ""Chemicals in personal-care products, sweat, and makeup can interfere with chlorine, making it much less effective,"" says Michele Hlavsa, R.N., M.P.H., of the CDC's Healthy Swimming Program. The result? Public pools in particular are often swimming with nasties such as cryptosporidium, which can bring on diarrhea, ear infections, and skin rashes. Showering after a dip can wash bacteria off your skin and cut your risk of getting sick. Use soap-a quick hose-off may not be enough.</p>",

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/basics-to-boost-metabolism,Weight Loss,134,80,20,8,0,7,1,0,,How to Speed Up Your Metabolism ,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0606-special-report-0857.jpg," I'm beginning to regret that I ever told my husband about last year's underwear experiment at the Mayo Clinic.<br /><br />In the study, a group of 20 volunteers - some thin, some overweight - wore high-tech undergarments day in and day out. (To my husband's disappointment, the clothing looked more like long johns than <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty-and-style/sexy-lingerie-fashions"">lingerie</a>.) The underwear contained motion sensors that tracked the wearers' every move. If they took a step, paused, shrugged, paced the room, scratched an itchy nose, or gestured wildly with their hands while reenacting the latest Sopranos episode, the action got recorded. At the end of 10 days, the investigators tallied up who'd moved the most.<br /><br />To no one's surprise, the skinny subjects turned out to be more fidgety. What did surprise the scientists was just how big a difference their extra movements made: The fidgeters burned as many as 350 extra calories a day. Even more interesting, when the investigators deliberately overfed the twitchy, which they did for 8 weeks, the fidgeters didn't become fat and slothful. They just paced, shifted their weight, and bit their cuticles even more. Something about these people compelled them to move. And it wasn't, as my husband suggested, that ""maybe their underwear was chafing them."" No, it seemed that the fidgeters simply had to be up and about, like hummingbirds. They had <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/boost-your-metabolism"">superfast metabolisms</a>. And so they burned calories faster than anyone else.<br /><br />Since I read this study, I've been drumming my fingers madly on any available surface and whipping my hair around like a supermodel in a cyclone. My husband has eyed my aimless hyperactivity dubiously. ""I don't think I can stand for you to be this fidgety,"" he says, then pauses. ""Unless you do it in a thong."" <br /><br /><b>Step On It Already</b><br /><br />I'm on a quest to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/set/?keycode=142686"">tweak my metabolism</a>. I used to have hip bones that jutted and a collarbone that could gut fish. I'm not bragging, merely relaying facts, when I say that I've always been effortlessly wiry. But a creeping doughiness has set in lately, as if a Teletubby were taking over my physique. Instead of dieting - deprivation is such a buzz kill - I've decided to try to rev my calorie-burning machinery, to make my metabolism hum.<br /><br />This is not, unfortunately, as simple as it sounds, or no one would be obese. Human metabolism involves a boggling number of biochemical processes. Think a car engine is complicated? It has nothing on the internal-combustion engines we carry around. Metabolism is the process by which our bodies convert food (fuel) into energy (blood sugar or, more technically, glucose). Every cell in the body is involved, because every cell needs energy. The heart, lungs, digestive organs, muscles, and brain all use glucose. The more work they have to do, the faster our metabolisms go. The simplest definition of metabolic rate is that it's the number of calories your body needs to function. That number changes constantly, depending on how fast your heart is beating, whether your muscles are idle or active, whether you've just eaten a large lunch, how much you decide to yell at your kid for turning the living-room wall into a paint canvas, and so on.Here's a glimpse of the metabolic activity going on inside you at this very moment. A part of your brain called the hypothalamus is releasing a hormone that tells the nearby pituitary gland how much of another hormone, called thyroid stimulating hormone, to release. This chemical nudge stimulates - you got it - your thyroid (that gland just beneath your Adam's apple). It releases still more hormones that help control every aspect of your metabolism, from your heart rate to the amount of glucose your cells absorb. But your thyroid isn't a lone gunman. Your pancreas is also releasing insulin, which controls the levels of glucose in your blood. And the adrenal glands are pumping out hormones that affect how fast your heart beats and your lungs inflate.<br /><br />Your metabolism is such a finely tuned machine that - no offense - if you had to coordinate it yourself, you'd probably keel over within the hour. Thank god our bodies are so good at taking care of business. Still, if you're anything like me, it's hard to fight the urge to interfere. You're doing a great job, I tell my metabolism, just great. I have just a few teensy suggestions for how you can do even better.<br /><br /><b>Hilary Swank Or Rosie O'Donnell?</b><br /><br />A few years back, researchers in Canada recruited sets of identical twins, which is what researchers often do when they want to study the genetics behind something or other. In this case, they wanted to know whether a person's metabolism was a matter of nature or nurture. In other words, is our caloric burn rate programmed from the day we're born, or is it something we can change? The scientists supersized the twins' food portions for 100 days, which basically meant they'd gain a bunch of weight. (Each pair of twins ate the same amount and exercised the same amount.) Next, the scientists underfed them, to the point where they were probably really snippy and hard to live with. <br /><br />The twins gained pounds, then lost them, right on cue. But while various sets of twins gained and lost quite different amounts, within the pairs the changes were remarkably consistent. Each twin gained and lost pretty much the same amount as the other. The researchers' conclusion: To a large degree, it's your genes that determine whether you have the physique of Hilary Swank or Rosie O'Donnell.<br /><br />I should be happy, because my sepia-tinted ancestors in the family photos are all lean and ropy. Instead I pout. Genetic jackpot notwithstanding, I'm putting on weight. I feel gypped. How has this happened? Though there is a set point to an individual's metabolic rate, I learn from weight-loss expert Jonathan Waitman, M.D., of New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City, that there is wiggle room. And that wiggle room can be considerable.<br /><br />Your metabolism consists of several elements, you see. The most fundamental is the basal metabolic rate. Your BMR is the number of calories your body needs just to stay alive: to pump blood, absorb oxygen, feed the muscles and brain, that kind of thing. It's the energy you burn when you're lying still, breathing slowly, and trying not to think. (The brain is the only organ in the body that relies solely on glucose for fuel. All the other organs use at least some fat. So increased brain activity means increased caloric needs, which means increased metabolic rate.)<br /><br />Your BMR accounts for 50 to 75 percent of your overall metabolism. The rest comes from digestion (food processing itself uses up calories - good to know!), purposeful activity (otherwise known as exercise), and what wonky researchers call ""nonexercise activity thermogenesis"" and you and I call fidgeting.<br /><br />Your BMR is mostly inherited - which explains why some sets of twins in the Canadian study gained or lost so much more than other pairs. But the other 25 to 50 percent of your metabolism is in your hands. You can change it.<br /><br />The thing is, changing it takes work. Tapping my foot and talking the Italian way is clearly just the beginning.<br /><br /><b>I Am So Trashing My Food Log</b><br /><br />I am starting to resent men. Ever since I began worrying about metabolism, I've been noticing them - at restaurants, on park benches, even in my own kitchen - devouring enormous portions of food, deploying, by all indications, little calorie-incinerating brain activity, and yet remaining slender. Women, even eating smaller amounts, balloon. As a believer in gender equality, I cannot let this pass.<br /><br />""Get fatter,"" I tell my husband. He rolls his eyes and wolfs another sandwich.<br /><br />There is, of course, an explanation for his easy-care thinness. ""Body size and body composition are major determinants of metabolic rate,"" says Janet Rankin, Ph.D., a professor in the Department of Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise at Virginia Tech. More heft requires more calories. Elephants burn way more than fleas. Men, typically larger than women, do the same.<br /><br />But even more important, men are by nature muscular. Women, by dint of our selfless willingness to keep the human race in business, have more body fat (nature intends us to use that fat to feed and protect growing fetuses). Unfortunately, fat is not metabolically active. It does not burn many calories. Muscle, on the other hand, is, and does. Some recent studies have shown that a pound of muscle at rest burns about 40 to 50 calories a day, an amount that rises when the person who owns the muscle is using it. A pound of fat at rest (as fat usually is) uses only about two calories a day. So the more muscle you have, the more calories you burn every minute, every hour, every day.<br /><br />Time to renew my gym membership.<br /><br />I also decide to figure out what my metabolic rate is. At a nearby health club, I lean into a gadget called a HealtheTech, which is designed to gauge my burn rate by measuring my oxygen output. I breathe, wait for the results, and am pleased: My rate is apparently a robust 2,150 calories a day, a full 750 more than the average woman of my size. <br /><br />But Elizabeth Darling, a clinical dietitian at St. Vincent's Hospital in my hometown of Santa Fe, New Mexico, cautions, ""These numbers are very difficult to interpret. Your metabolic rate changes constantly throughout the day, depending on whether you just ate or drank or moved around."" To get an absolutely accurate baseline measurement, you would have to breathe into the gadget immediately after waking - before leaving your bed, having breakfast, pacing around your bedroom, or driving to the health club.<br /><br />Instead, Darling and most other nutrition experts agree that the best way to measure your daily metabolic rate is to look honestly at the amount you eat. If you're not gaining weight, then your daily calorie consumption is also your metabolic rate. If, as Dr. Waitman says diplomatically, ""you've tipped the balance"" - you're packing on the pounds - your metabolic rate is somewhat less than your caloric intake. But how to figure those calories?<br /><br />""Keep a food log,"" Dr. Rankin says. A full list of all - with an emphasis on all - the foods and liquids you ingest daily for a minimum of 3 days will give you an exact measure. I buy a notebook and a calorie counter and begin diligently tracking my daily fare.<br /><br />By midafternoon of Day 1, I've thrown the notebook across the kitchen twice. <br /><br />If you have never kept a food log, prepare to be scandalized. I had no idea I was eating so much. That smidge of cream in your coffee? That schmear of peanut butter on your bagel? All have to be measured and recorded. The crackers, the grapes, the Coke, those villainous Samoas Girl Scout cookies. I hang my head as I write (then brush my hair spasmodically out of my eyes in hopes of burning at least a calorie or two).<br /><br />By the end of 3 days, I have filled many pages with the ugly record of my dietary indiscretions. And I have determined that I am eating an average of 2,670 calories a day. 2,670!<br /><br />I promise myself that I will destroy the notebook the very first opportunity I get. <br /><br /><b>I Always Knew Dieting Was A Bad Idea</b><br /><br />I also had planned to cut back on the Samoas. But after talking with various nutrition experts, I'm not so sure that such drastic action is wise. ""You get a big reduction in metabolic rate with a substantial reduction in calories,"" Dr. Rankin has told me. Translated, this means that if you eat less, you'll start burning calories more slowly. Net change: next to nada.<br /><br />Does this seem fair?<br /><br />Upon reflection, I have to admit that it makes evolutionary sense. Back in the hunter-gatherer days, our bodies had to survive on not so many calories. We developed efficient metabolisms. So when you or I cut back on Taco Bell visits, some deep, atavistic portion of our brain remembers those dark, DNA-imprinted days. It says, ""We're starving. Slow the system down."" This may help explain the recent news that people who radically cut their calorie consumption are likely to live longer - their bodies don't chug along as fast, so they hold up better. But really, where's the fun in that? No point in living forever if you can't eat.<br /><br />Recent studies of Native American tribes with exceptionally high levels of obesity and diabetes have found that many members share a gene mutation, nicknamed the ""thrifty gene,"" that compels them to put on weight. They have inordinately slow metabolisms. These tribes also happen to live in particularly harsh areas, such as the desert Southwest, where food has traditionally been scarce. If we suddenly had a global famine, we'd die off, and they'd live to repopulate the earth. <br /><br />""Cutting calories by 20 percent or more below energy needs"" will definitely dampen your metabolism, Dr. Rankin tells me. It's better, she says, to reduce calories gradually and maintain your metabolism by both weight training (remember, muscle is your friend) and basic, everyday exercise. Go for a run. Go for a bike ride. Go for a walk. Studies have shown, Dr. Rankin says, that any kind of regular, vigorous exercise - such as a hard 30-minute run several times a week - will rev your system, causing you to burn about 100 extra calories a day above and beyond the ones you used during the exercise itself. Bonus!<br /><br />I grab a Samoa - just to keep my metabolism humming, you understand - and head out for a 30-minute jog. <br /><br /><b>The Joys Of Java</b><br /><br />You may notice that I haven't talked about pills. Google the phrase ""raise your metabolism"" and the vast majority of the Web sites that pop up are touting supplements of one kind or another. Now, I'm as lazy as the next person. I'd be pleased to swallow a pill, recline gracefully, and let my metabolism fly. But most of these products, frankly, scare me. Remember ephedra? An herb containing a version of the alertness chemical epinephrine, ephedra does, without question, raise users' metabolisms. It stimulates the central nervous system, making a person's heart race, her blood pressure rise - and, if she happens to be unhealthy or just unlucky, making her drop dead from a heart attack or a stroke. Health officials logged more than 19,000 ""adverse events"" from ephedra use before banning it in 2004. Now, thanks to a federal judge's ruling last year in Utah, ephedra is legal again and for sale in that state or over the Internet, in small doses. Or there's bitter orange. Like ephedra, the peel of this fruit is thought to raise metabolism, along with blood pressure and heart rate. Though it hasn't been linked to any deaths, experts urge caution. I decide against trying either of them. Lazy is one thing; self-destructive is another.<br /><br />On the other hand, I'm thrilled to read that some research suggests that coffee is a metabolic booster. It, too, stimulates the central nervous system. Eagerly, I up my consumption, from a cup or two per day to four. (I'm sure my doctor would scold, but if coffee is my worst vice, I think I'm not doing too badly.) I'm fairly certain my metabolism is thrumming. Plus, I'm jittery. Good. More nonexercise activity thermogenesis, I tell myself.<br /><br /><b>And Another Thing About Lingerie</b><br /><br />It's been several weeks since I started my metabo-quest, and I have learned much. I'm going to the gym to lift weights twice a week and running 3 to 4 miles on other days. I'm swilling coffee and pacing my office and crossing and uncrossing my legs. I'm obsessively twirling my hair. I should be continuing that dastardly food log, but I don't have the stomach for it. Besides, I have better measures of whether my metabolism is revving. I'm eating almost as much as I ever was, but already my pants are looser. My upper arms are tighter. And my husband brings up the subject of 
ingerie more than ever.<br /><br />He has another pressing interest. I immediately agree. After all, intimate relations increase your heart rate and burn about 35 calories an hour. Anything, I tell him, for the cause.<p></p><p> </p><p><i><b>For more slimming tips, check out our <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss"">women's weight loss section</a>. </b></i></p>","Getting Started,Eating Strategies,You and Improved,Be In The Know,Special Reports"

This calming technique reduces stress, insomnia, chronic pain, depression, and, most recently, it was shown to strengthen immunity, according to researchers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. And it's a lot easier than you think. Here are seven things your Zen master won't tell you, but we will.<br /><br /><b>1. You don't need a zendo.</b><br />You don't even need to use the word ""zendo,"" Japanese for ""meditation hall.""<br /><br />Serenity is a second away-anyplace, anytime. Your living room or bedroom will do - wherever you feel comfortable. ""Eventually, you can learn to do it anywhere, but for beginners, it's easier if they have their own little spot,"" says Alan Finger, <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/yoga/how-to-find-a-yogi"">yoga master</a> and founder of the Be Yoga and Yoga Works studios. The more you practice, the easier it will become to reach your meditative state on command - at your computer screen, waiting in traffic, or at the airport before a flight. Try to get in the habit of meditating in the morning instead of at night, when you're more likely to forget or be distracted.<br /><br /><b>2. You don't need a teacher with an exotic name and background.</b><br />Not if you've got the book or audio, according to Stephan Bodian, author of <i>Meditation for Dummies</i>. ""The practice itself is relatively easy,"" says Bodian, who compares meditation to running. You have to build muscle in order to run far and for long periods of time, just like you have to train your mind to be attentive and aware. All you need to do is breathe. Once you're sitting quietly, close your eyes, and inhale and exhale easily and fully. For more information, check out <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/transcendental-meditation-benefits-and-how-to-get-started"">6 benefits of transcendental meditation (and how to get started today)</a>.<br /><br /><b>3. You don't need an hour of alone time.</b><br />Some time is better than none. And like most things in life, if you're drawn to it, you'll invest yourself more fully with time, energy, and money. Start off by sitting for 2 or 3 minutes, 5 days a week. Slowly build up to 10, 15, and eventually 25 minutes. ""It's a good amount of time to really feel refreshed afterward and calm,"" Finger says. Your blood pressure may decrease after just 15 minutes of meditation twice a day, according to at least one recent study. Lowering blood pressure by a few millimeters can significantly reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease.<br /><br /><b>4. You don't have to sit in some awkward yogic pose.</b><br />Holding your Half Lord of the Fishes pose (the what?) may require a lot more energy than needed. Meditation means doing nothing. If your muscles are tense, it will be difficult to slow and calm your breath. ""Meditation is the art of quieting yourself down so that your brain goes into the stillest rhythm, called delta, which is equal to deep sleep,"" Finger says. ""And when your brain goes still, you can't be doing anything else.""<br /><br />Sitting, standing, walking, and lying in bed or on the floor are all traditional positions for meditating. Suit up in some loose, comfortable clothes, lower the lights, and sit cross-legged on the floor. Prop a pillow under each knee for support. If you're having trouble keeping your back straight, it's okay to sit in a chair instead. Relax your stomach muscles to allow free range of diaphragmatic breathing. Make yourself as comfortable as possible to better ease into this state of mind, but not so comfortable that you actually fall asleep.<br /><br /><b>5. You don't have to empty your mind.</b><br />Thinking doesn't have to stop, but the attempt to stop thinking does. ""There's a difference between thinking and getting caught up in your thinking,"" Bodian says. As thoughts about work, kids, and chores go through your head, concentrate on following your breath. If you find yourself planning and obsessing, just come back to your breathing. ""The good thing about your breath is that it's always present,"" Bodian says. ""Just hook up with your breath again; your mind continues to think, but you're not involved in thinking.""</p><p><strong>Related content from <em>Women's Health</em>: </strong><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/meditation-effects"">Your Body On... Meditation</a><br /><br /><b>6. You'll never achieve a permanent state of bliss and unshakable peace.</b><br />Unless you're on drugs, a feeling of pure bliss and serenity isn't something you can create, though it may arise from time to time while meditating. ""What tends to happen if you're present, open, and relaxed in the moment is that you'll be more peaceful, more content, and more open - it's a by-product,"" Bodian says. But if you try to manipulate your mind to produce these feelings, you're not letting your mind relax. ""If you try to achieve it, paradoxically, you won't,"" Bodian says. You spend your whole day pushing yourself to be better - at work, at home, in your relationships. Meditation is meant to be a break from that. Stop wrestling with your thoughts, body itches, and tics, and just . . . be.<br /><br /><b>7. You don't have to chant.</b><br />Not really. In fact, inner peace has no sound. So turn the TV off and listen to the quiet. Don't speak or think or move. Just relax. Chanting is just one of many techniques you can try to quiet yourself down.

""Most people attend tons of festive events-and nearly all of them center around fattening food,"" says Michelle May, M.D., author of Eat What You Love, Love What You Eat. Add seasonal stress and zero time to cook or hit the gym, and you have a recipe for holiday weight gain. Well, not this year. Here's a plan for dodging diet pitfalls-everything from thousand-calorie eggnog lattes at the mall food court to button-popping family dinners.</p><p><strong>At the Office Holiday Party...</strong><br /><strong>The Danger:</strong> An open bar and endless platters of spring rolls and pigs in a blanket</p><p><strong>The Detour:</strong><br /><strong>Step 1: Keep Moving.</strong><br />If you're planted next to the food table, you'll shovel chips and dip into your mouth all night long. ""So stay far, far away,"" says Danine Fruge, M.D., director of Women's Health and Family Medicine at the Pritikin Longevity Center & Spa in Miami. ""You won't eat mindlessly if you have to cross the room to get to the food.""</p><p><strong>Step 2: Be Picky.</strong><br />Passed hors d'oeuvres, which hover at every turn, are small, but they add up-fast. To avoid eating 2,000 calories worth of canapes, limit yourself to three that you love. Been waiting all year for bacon-wrapped scallops? Go for it. But pass on the crab cakes and other fried fare.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Sip Smartly.</strong><br />With alcohol, the goal is to keep both your calories and your buzz under control. Some options:</p><p><strong>A single shot of vodka, gin, or rum mixed with club or diet soda and a squeeze of lime.</strong> It will set you back only about 100 calories, says Christine Gerbstadt, M.D., R.D.</p><p><strong>Champagne or pink Prosecco.</strong> ""Not only are they low on the calorie chart-around 80 to 120 per glass-but they're also more likely to be sipped rather than guzzled,"" says Kristin Reisinger, R.D.</p><p><strong>Light beer or wine.</strong> Most have fewer than 150 calories per serving. If you're the type to make several trips to the bar (no judgments!), Fruge suggests asking the bartender to fill your glass only halfway each time.</p><p><strong>At the Food Court While Shopping...</strong><br /><strong>The Danger:</strong> ""Having to make decisions diminishes people's willpower,"" says Kathleen Vohs, Ph. D ., an associate professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management. So all the choices you face at the mall (point-and-shoot camera or digital camcorder for your man? Espresso machine or French press for Mom?) will make you that much more vulnerable to temptation at the food court.</p><p><strong>The Detour:</strong><br /><strong>Step 1: Pack Snacks.</strong> Malls are filled with kiosks hawking softball-size cinnamon buns and soft pretzels on steroids. Keeping portion-controlled goodies in your bag will make other snacks easier to resist. Stick 30 pistachios or 24 almonds in a ziplock bag with two dried plums, or tote a Fiber One Oats & Chocolate bar. The carb/protein combo in these foods will keep you full.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Sidestep Seasonal Sirens.</strong> An economic theory called the scarcity principle explains why we're such suckers for holiday treats. ""Decades of research show that items we perceive as being in limited supply seem more desirable to us than nonscarce items,"" says Vohs. Holiday-themed coffee drinks and sweets are often more caloric than regular ones, so it's safer to stick to the basics.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Chew On It.</strong> Pop in a piece of gum to keep your mouth occupied and out of trouble. Gum can satisfy a sweet craving, and studies show that the chewing sensation sends appetite suppressant messages to your brain, says Reisinger.</p><p><strong>As You Bake Holiday Treats at Home...</strong><br /><strong>The Danger:</strong> ""It's easy to think that 'tastes' are calorie-free,"" says Los Angeles-based dietitian Ashley Koff. But just because two spoonfuls of cookie dough fail to register emotionally doesn't mean they don't count. (In fact, they count right up to 500 calories.)</p><p><strong>The Detour:</strong><br /><strong>Step 1: Open A Window.</strong> Nothing smells as good as the scent of cinnamon and sugar wafting through your kitchen, but allowing it to linger for hours can trigger you to eat more. Light a green-apple-scented candle (which studies have shown can reduce appetite) or crack a window to air out the tempting aroma.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Clean As You Go.</strong> Have a pan of hot, soapy water on standby and plunge batter-covered beaters and spoons into it once you're done with them. ""This protects you from nibbling,"" says Koff. And cleanup is that much easier.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Save Your Dough.</strong> When you're tempted by a cookie-dough-laden mixing spoon, remember this: The raw eggs in that dough may contain salmonella, a bacteria that can cause food poisoning and was the reason for the recall of more than 380 million eggs earlier this year.</p><p><strong>At Your Family's Holiday Dinner...</strong><br /><strong>The Danger:</strong> Variety may be the spice of life, but it's the scourge of your scale. ""The more options there are, the more we want to try,"" says Koert Van Ittersum, Ph.D., an associate professor of marketing at Georgia Institute of Technology.</p><p><strong>The Detour:</strong><br /><strong>Step 1: B.Y.O.D.</strong> Offer to bring a healthy dish. Your stressed-out hostess will welcome the contribution, and you'll have a safe go-to.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Pick A Plate With Purpose.</strong> Van Ittersum suggests starting your meal by loading a dinner plate with salad (dressing on the side). Then switch to a smaller salad plate for your main course (studies show we eat less from smaller dishes).</p><p><strong>Step 3: Practice Portion Control.</strong> ""Your total amount of carbs-potatoes, cranberry sauce, stuffing-should be the size of your fist,"" says Koff. ""Shaq, for example, can eat a lot more mashed potatoes than you or I can or should."" The same goes for lean proteins, which should be the size and thickness of your palm (no fingers).</p><p><strong>When You're Coming in from the Cold...</strong><br /><strong>The Danger:</strong> Don't kid yourself into thinking that you've burned so many extra calories keeping warm on that winter walk or sledding excursion that you need to refuel...with eggnog. ""Cold weather alone does not increase your caloric needs in any significant way,"" says Pete McCall, a physiologist at the American Council on Exercise.</p><p><strong>The Detour:</strong><br /><strong>Step 1: Stay Hydrated.</strong> Without sweat as a cue during cold-weather activities, you can easily dehydrate. If your body misinterprets your thirst as hunger, that Gruyere fondue will own you. Carry a water bottle and sip generously.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Warm Up.</strong> Eating has a thermodynamic (heat-generating) effect, explains nutritionist Heidi Skolnik. So we often reach for food not necessarily because we're hungry, but because we're cold. After a wintry outdoor activity, bypass the kitchen and toss a log onto the fire or snuggle up in a blanket. Still hungry? See Step 3.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Drink Your Snack.</strong> Fill a mug with skim or low-fat milk and a tablespoon of Ghirardelli Sweet Ground Chocolate & Cocoa, and you'll have a rich, satisfying treat for around 100 calories, says Skolnik. Or better yet, have a cup of green tea-it contains catechins, compounds that can boost calorie burn.</p>",

But if you're already a couple, odds are that kissing just isn't on his mind once your clothes are off. Remember: Men's brains have evolved to identify and tackle one problem at a time, so it's very possible that when we're busy fondling you, rubbing you, or watching your body move, we just might forget to throw in some kisses, too. Your guy is probably lost in the moment, so just pull his face toward yours during sex if you're craving more lip action, and he'll get the hint. If he doesn't, bring it up afterward, after the post-coital glow fades.</p><p><strong>What's the best way to introduce my boyfriend to one of my exes? </strong><em>-Jacqui, Richmond, VA</em></p><p>If you bump into your ex randomly, just say hello in passing and fill your guy in later. But if your ex is still involved in your social circle, give your man a casual heads-up so he won't feel blindsided. When the time comes, present the ex to your boyfriend--not the other way around--and if the guys have anything in common (aside from you), mention it. ""[Ex-boyfriend] is a big Steelers fan too."" Hopefully your boyfriend will pick up the conversation. If he doesn't, tell your ex, ""Well, it was good to see you,"" and walk away with your man.</p><p><strong>My husband just started working out, and I'm loving the results! How do I keep him motivated? </strong><em>-Jennifer, Augusta, GA</em></p><p>He just needs positive reinforcement. When he peels his shirt off after the gym, trace your fingers over his new definition, tell him how much you like to look at him or touch him, or let your hands drift below his belt. That's phase one. Phase two: Make working out part of your relationship. Plan your gym trips so they coincide with his, which will give him extra incentive to stay fit.</p>","guy next door,Jan/Feb 2014"

But now it seems like you couldn't lose a pound unless you cut your arm off. You've hit the dreaded plateau - a frustratingly common dieting phenomenon. ""At a certain point in weight loss, usually after losing about 10 percent of your weight, you may have to tweak your diet and exercise to jump-start your body again,"" says Susan Mitchell, Ph.D., R.D., co-author of <i>Fat Is Not Your Fate.</i> Here's why you might stall and what you can do to rev back up.<br /><br /><b>You're eating for 164 (pounds, not people).</b><br /><br /><b>Flatline</b> Yeah, losing mass means you look better in your low-riders, but it also means there's less of you to burn calories. It's a cruel truth: Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) - the number of calories your body needs just to exist - gets lower as you get littler. Keep eating for your old weight and you're going to hit a wall.<br /><br /><b>Finish line</b> As the number on the <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/the-best-scales-for-weight-loss"">scale </a>goes down, so too must your food intake. Figure out your BMR by dividing your current weight by 2.2 pounds, then multiplying this number by 0.9, and then by 24. (Or calculate it at <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.bmicalculator.net/bmrcalculator"">bmicalculator.net/bmrcalculator</a>.) Now multiply your BMR by 1.2 and voil: You've got the average number of calories your body burns per day when you factor in normal activities. (Add another 300 to 500 on days you do an hour of moderate to intense exercise.) Once you have your final number, shave off 500 to find out how many calories you need to eat to lose a pound a week, or 300 to lose 2 pounds a month. Just don't ever go below 1,200 a day or you'll run into the problem below.<br /><br /><b>You're eating for 95.</b><br /><br /><b>Flatline</b> Here's the flip side: There's such a thing as eating too little to lose weight. ""The body needs a certain number of calories per day to meet minimum metabolic needs, such as cardiovascular function and respiration,"" Mitchell says. When you're running on empty, your brain sends signals to various organs (like your thyroid), telling them to slow down your metabolism to conserve energy.<br /><br /><b>Finish line</b> Strategy? Simple: ""Increase your calories,"" Mitchell says. ""Many women are afraid to do this because they think they'll gain weight, when actually the body will function more efficiently and they'll start losing again."" If you're stuck (and starving), try adding 100 calories a day for 2 weeks.<br /><br /><b>You could work out in your sleep.</b><br /><br /><b>Flatline</b> Been repeating the same moves since you made your New Year's resolutions? You need a kick in your (shrinking) behind. ""When your body is used to an exercise, it stops making physiological changes,"" says Cassandra Forsythe, a nutrition and exercise scientist at the University of Connecticut. Translation: Your bod has become so efficient at doing your current routine that it's burning fewer calories. Want proof? A recent study in the <i>International Journal of Obesity</i> found that runners who didn't increase their mileage gained weight over time.<br /><br /><b>Finish line</b> Mix it up. ""To grow more muscle and keep your metabolic rate high, you have to damage the muscles a little by challenging your body with a different workout,"" Forsythe says. If you're a treadmill rat, get on the elliptical or bike. If you're hell-bent on the treadmill, up the intensity (by adjusting the speed or incline) every other minute, or work up to a longer run by adding a half mile every couple of weeks. In the weight room, forget those 15 reps you usually do with a 5-pounder: ""Decrease the number of reps and increase the weight, using one you can lift only five to eight times,"" Forsythe says.<br /><br /><b>You've become an exercise fanatic.</b><br /><br /><b>Flatline</b> So you've amped up your workout. Great! Now you have to give your body time to recover. If you don't schedule any downtime, the pounds won't budge. ""When you're sore after a workout, it's because you've torn the muscle fiber,"" explains Angela Corcoran, head of education and corporate development at the American Academy of Personal Training in New York City. ""When you rest, the muscle fiber has a chance to heal and comes back more effectively. This drives up metabolism, so you burn more calories at rest.""<br /><br /><b>Finish line</b> Take a day off! Corcoran says she's seen clients lose weight after logging a few days of rest. But this doesn't mean you get a week to lie around watching Lost reruns (nice try): 24 to 48 hours is all your body needs to recover and recharge. Forsythe suggests working out 2 consecutive days followed by a day of rest, taking no more than 3 days off in a row.<br /><br /><b>Your body balks.</b><br /><br /><b>Flatline</b> Like it or not, you have a ""set point,"" Forsythe says - a genetically determined weight where you're most comfortable. To stick to this number and regulate its fat stores, your body uses a gazillion physiological mechanisms, like interactions between hormones and molecules that affect hunger levels. So if you're trying to drop 20 pounds below your set point, you're getting in the ring with Mama Nature: When you don't eat enough to maintain your set point, your body thinks you're starving and ""responds by lowering its metabolic rate, which reduces the number of calories you burn,"" Forsythe says.<br /><br /><b>Finish line</b> The best way to conquer your set point is to speed up your metabolism with regular exercise - at least 30 minutes of cardio, 5 days a week. It also helps to increase the amount of good fats (such as monounsaturated) and lean protein (think fish and poultry) in your diet - these foods can accelerate your metabolism.</p><p> </p><p><i><b>For more slimming tips, check out our <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss"">women's weight loss</a> section.</b></i></p>",Work It Off

More crucial factors are the shape of your <a href=""/beauty-and-style/how-to-avoid-blisters-with-sandals"">feet</a> and the way you walk. <br /><b>How to deal</b> For foot pain relief, buy shoes made of stretchy material, such as leather, that will conform to the curves of your foot. Before throwing down your plastic, hold the sole of the shoe against the sole of your foot to make sure the toe box is at least as wide as your tootsies. Using custom <a href=""/health/shoe-inserts"">insoles</a>, which any podiatrist can provide, may prevent bunions from worsening, but surgery is the only real cure. Still, docs don't recommend it unless the pain is so bad you can't function normally. Most procedures involve shaving down the bone and realigning the toe with a pin or a screw, which leaves you hobbling around for one to two months afterward.

A podiatrist can also give you cortisone shots to tame the pain. If you've tried those options and are still desperate, surgery offers permanent relief. A small piece of bone on one or both sides of the joint is removed so the toe can uncurl, and a pin is sometimes left in for a few weeks to keep it in place.<p></p><p></p><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/images/agonyofthefeet/agony-3.gif"" /><br /><br /><b>Rubbed the wrong way aka CORNS AND CALLUSES</b><br /><b>Looks like</b> Raised layers of thick, dead skin.

If the layers are really thick, have a podiatrist shave them down during an in-office medical pedicure (because there's a risk of infection, stay away from the nail salon for this).

This can be triggered by the strain of having exceptionally flat or high arches, standing or walking all day long, being overweight, or doing intense physical activities. <br /><b>How to deal</b> Try OTC arch supports or custom insoles to take stress off the plantar fascia and a topical gel called Biofreeze, also at drugstores, to increase blood flow and ease the ouch. If you're really in agony, ultrasound therapy and shock-wave therapy can speed healing. There's also a new, minimally invasive surgery called an endoscopic plantar fasciotomy, in which a surgeon makes a tiny snip into the plantar fascia to release the tense tissue. However, a study found that up to 25 percent of people who have this surgery continue to experience pain.<p></p><p></p><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/images/agonyofthefeet/agony-5.gif"" /><br /><br /> <b>In a pinch aka NEUROMA</b><br /><b>Feels like </b>Tingling, burning, or numbness in your foot.

(Yes, Mom, we know: You do it because you care!) It's time to turn the tables, because when it comes to your health, the woman who birthed you, bathed you, and burped you is the closest thing you have to a crystal ball. We all appreciate the lovelier physical traits we've inherited--a set of perfectly straight, <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty-and-style/teeth-whitening"">white teeth</a>, a Nascar-worthy metabolism--but it's important to take stock of the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/conditions""><b>health problems</b></a> she may have passed down along with them. Asking her these questions could clue you in to your possible future--and help you give unhealthy inherited traits risks the boot.<br /><br /><b>""Are you as tall now as you were at 21?"" </b><br /><br />If your mom has lost an inch or two since her sorority days, it could be a sign of osteoporosis or the less-severe osteopenia, says Isador H. Lieberman, M.D., a professor of surgery and an orthopedic and spinal surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Weston, Florida. And if she has <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/get-stronger-bones"">osteoporosis</a>, there's a 50 percent chance you'll develop it too. On the flip side, if your mom still has the frame of a 35-year-old, you're not as likely to be hobbling around with a hunchback or hip fractures later in life.<br /><br /><b>Escape the parent trap</b> To keep your skeleton well-steeled, ""get at least 1,000 milligrams of calcium a day from low-fat dairy and take a multi with vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium,"" Lieberman says. At the gym, hit the free weights along with the treadmill. ""Bones get stronger in response to force, and strength-training can target areas like the shoulders, spine, and wrists,"" he says. <br /><br />If your mom has osteoporosis, ask your doctor about getting a bone-density scan. If it shows a skeleton that's Fabergé-fragile, you can toughen it up by guzzling even more dairy, ramping up your strength-training, and taking prescription meds. Think of your skeleton as a rock that's slowly being eroded: The harder and stronger you can make the stone, the better it will stand up over time. <br /><br /><b>""Did you have a rough pregnancy?"" </b><br /><br />Your own version of <i>Knocked Up</i> won't necessarily play out like your mom's <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/calcium-while-pregnant"">pregnancy</a>, but certain complications do have a genetic link, says Orna Kolker, M.D., assistant clinical instructor of obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City. ""Find out if mom had a C-section due to a narrow or unevenly aligned pelvis,"" she says. If you have her Zellweger-thin hips, you could face a similar baby-won't-budge situation in the delivery room. You can also inherit a higher risk for blood-clotting disorders, gestational diabetes, and pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure and high protein levels in the urine). Even if Mom faced nothing worse than morning sickness, ""hearing about her experiences can reassure you that what you're going through, whether it's five-alarm heartburn or labor anxiety, is normal,"" Kolker says.<br /><br /><b>Escape the parent trap</b> If your mom cops to any of the issues we've mentioned, let your ob-gyn know, especially if you're pregnant or plan to get there soon. ""Your doctor can work with you to take steps to prevent complications,"" says Robert Atlas, M.D., chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore. ""For example, in the case of pre-eclampsia, she may prescribe more fruits and veggies along with fetus-friendly exercise to lower your risk.""<br /><br /><b>""How'd your last eye exam go?"" </b><br /><br />Um, yeah, you know she wears contacts. But ""quiz her about whether she's ever been diagnosed with glaucoma (damage to the optic nerve) or macular degeneration (thinning of the retina),"" says Mark Swan, O.D., M.Ed., a professor of optometry at Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Michigan. ""Both conditions run in families and often are severe before symptoms occur."" That's dan­gerous, because if they're not discovered early, they can lead to vision damage and even blindness. <br /><br /><b> Escape the parent trap</b> ""If glaucoma or macular degeneration runs in your family, whether you light up can make the difference between getting them or not,"" Swan says. ""Smoking reduces blood flow to the eye area, depletes levels of crucial antioxidants that keep eyes healthy, and damages delicate eye tissues."" If Mom (or Dad) has one of these conditions, start getting yearly vision exams now--even if you see 20/20--and let your doctor know so she can check for early warning signs. If she does spot problems, the sooner you get treated, the more likely your vision will be to stay sharp for years to come.<br /><br /><b>""Ever get the blues?"" </b><br /><br />Don't assume your mom would tell you she's been popping Prozac. ""Many people aren't comfortable bringing up mental health issues, even with their own families,"" says Michael C. Smith, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist and associate professor at the Chicago School of Professional Psychology. Yet studies show that having a parent with clinical depression or anxiety makes you two to three times more prone to dark days than someone without an immediate family history. If your mom is more upbeat than a B-52s single, consider yourself lucky: ""We learn our coping skills from our parents, so a mother who's adept at dealing with obstacles is likely to pass those techniques down to her daughter,"" Smith says.<br /><br /><b>Escape the parent trap</b> Try not to fake happy. ""Opening up to friends and family about how you feel can mean a huge improvement in your mood,"" Smith says. A study from the University of Oregon found that depressed women with weak social support were more likely to remain depressed than those with strong ties. ""If you do feel more sad, worried, or stressed than usual for longer than two weeks, ask your doctor to recommend a cognitive-­behavioral therapist,"" he says. <br /><br /><b>""Have you ever had a mole removed?"" </b><br /><br />Even if you've spent every one of your beach days under an umbrella, ""you're still more likely to have skin damage if your mom does,"" says Doris Day, M.D., a dermatologist in New York City. Ask whether she's ever had a precancerous or cancerous mole or lesion removed. Dermatologists say that because spots can often be scraped or frozen off in a doctor's office, people neglect to tell their family about it. <br /><br /><b>Escape the parent trap</b> Could your mama win a face-off with Demi Moore? Find out how she takes care of her skin--is it an SPF-45 habit? daily moisturizer?--and follow her lead. If her hide droops lower than a hobo bag, ""consider getting a prescription for a retinoid cream (such as Retin-A), which can minimize wrinkles and prevent damaged skin cells from developing into cancer,"" Day says. If you do have a family history of skin cancer, use sunscreen religiously, even if you have dark skin. In addition to getting checked by a derm, ask your eye doc to look for pigment changes in your peepers, which can be a sign of skin cancer.<br />",
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/be-efficient,Life,27,72,39,6,1,3,0,0,,Stop Multitasking,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1005-multitasking-art.jpg,"<p>By now, we all know that multitasking can be a lose-lose proposition. (Talking on the phone while driving? Dumb idea. Texting while driving? Really dumb idea.) But even seemingly benign multitasking-like chatting with a friend while sending out an office e-mail-isn't as efficient or harmless as we might believe. A recent study published in the science journal NeuroImage revealed that when we attempt demanding tasks simultaneously, we end up doing neither as well as we should, because our brains have cognitive limits. We may think we're doing two things at once, but our brains are actually toggling between them.</p><p>What's more, we're also less efficient after we've shut down e-mail and turned off our phones. In a recent experiment at Stanford University, a group of students was asked to spend 30 minutes simultaneously compiling a music playlist, chatting, and writing a short essay. A second group focused on each task individually for 10 minutes each. Afterward, they were given a working memory test...and the single-taskers significantly outperformed their multitasking peers.</p><p>""A tremendous amount of evidence shows that the brain does better when it's performing tasks in sequence, rather than all at once,"" says Clifford Nass, Ph.D., a professor of communication at Stanford University. ""There's a huge cost to your concentration every time you switch gears. We still don't know the long-term effects of chronic multitasking, but there's no question we're bad at it, and it's bad for us.""</p><p>Amanda A. McGowan, a licensed acupuncturist and Chinese medicine practitioner specializing in stress-related disorders, agrees. She thinks that many of her patients who complain of fatigue are suffering the effects of mental distraction and overextension. ""Multitasking has long been thought to slow down and even injure the mind,"" she says, ""and those of us who practice Chinese medicine believe it can also injure the body.""</p><p>Many experts believe, however, that it's possible to repair your power of concentration. Read on as a yoga instructor, acupuncturist, management expert, and others reveal their tricks for breaking the multitasking habit and sharpening your focus.</p><p><strong>Savor Your Senses</strong><br />Ever close your eyes when biting into something delicious? That's your body automatically shutting down one sense- your vision-in order to fully appreciate the taste. But how often do we really focus on a single sense? A relaxing bath, for example, might involve not just warm water, but also candles, background music, scented oils, a stack of magazines, and maybe something to sip while you soak. Just like that, all five senses are stimulated at once. (Even our downtime is busy!)</p><p>The logic goes something like this: If eating is fun, and reading is also fun, then eating while reading is bound to be twice as fun! Not so much, McGowan says. ""According to Chinese medicine, one organ, the spleen, is responsible for both thinking and eating,"" she explains. ""So if you're reading a book while having lunch, your body really isn't getting much of a break. In fact, it's the worst thing you can do if you're already feeling exhausted.""</p><p><strong>Try this:</strong> Don't automatically pile on the extras; enjoy each sensation separately. Take your relaxing bath in peace. Listen to your iPod while lying in bed, focusing on every note. Savor a treat from beginning to end, closing your eyes not just for the first taste, but for each subsequent bite as well.</p><p><strong>Do the ""Tree""</strong><br />Yoga is a great way to fine-tune your focus because it requires your total concentration (instructors call it ""being in the moment""). ""If you're not physically and mentally 'present,' you'll find yourself falling out of balance very easily,"" explains yoga instructor Adam Marcus, owner of Enso Studio in Media, Pennsylvania. Balance postures are particularly effective. Says Marcus: ""These poses, or 'asanas,' are designed to force you to pay close attention to your breathing and your body."" Distractions don't stand a chance.</p><p><strong>Try this:</strong> To restore your mental balance, anytime and anywhere, Marcus suggests doing the tree pose. Here's how: Stand straight but relaxed, palms pressed together at your ""heart center"" (the middle of your rib cage). ""First, take one slow, deep breath to calm your nervous system,"" he says. ""Now it's time to stabilize your body by bringing focus to all of your muscles. Start by engaging the muscles in your right foot, move up your calf and thigh, then on to your pelvis and core (pull your navel in toward your spine), then bring your shoulders back and chin up. Now raise your left foot and place the sole gently against your right ankle, calf, or inner thigh. Keeping your hands at your heart center, hold this pose for five deep, full breaths. Repeat on the other side.""</p><p><strong>Embrace the Silence</strong><br />Sometimes even grown-ups need a time-out. Konchog Norbu, an American Buddhist monk in the Tibetan tradition, believes that simply sitting still in silence confers tremendous mental and physical benefits on those who do it regularly. ""It's called 'calm abiding,' and it's the first stage of Buddhist meditation,"" he explains. It not only strengthens the mind's ability to focus and avoid distractions but also ""can slow your heart, lower your blood pressure, and improve your memory.""</p><p><strong>Try this:</strong> Norbu recommends sitting quietly for five to 10 minutes-once in the morning and once in the evening. Concentrate on your breathing and ""let the business of your mind go,"" he instructs. ""You should start to notice changes, like a better ability to concentrate, within a couple of weeks.""</p><p><strong>Consider Your Actions</strong><br />A. J. Jacobs, best-selling author of <em>The Guinea Pig Diaries</em>, pledged to quit multitasking- cold turkey-for an entire month. In his quest for focus, Jacobs went to extremes: He dismantled his Internet access before sitting down to write, and at one point, literally tied himself to his desk chair. But the thing that really worked, according to Jacobs, was metacognition. ""Whenever I noticed my mind wandering- which was pretty much constantly-I'd gently guide my thoughts back.""</p><p><strong>Try this:</strong> One way Jacobs refocused was by describing his actions aloud. ""Telling yourself, 'I am walking down the sidewalk,' makes you present,"" he says. If you're not bold enough to verbalize-Jacobs confesses he got some strange looks-just think about your actions. ""Simply acknowledging the moment taught me how to be in the moment,"" he says.</p><p><strong>Keep Careful Track</strong><br />Sophie Leroy, Ph.D., an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota's Carlson School of Management, has a slightly different take on distraction. ""When we think of multitasking, we think about choosing to do different activities at once, like driving and talking on the phone,"" she says. ""But another form of multitasking occurs when your brain can't focus because it's busy thinking about all the other things you have to do.""</p><p>This is a particularly common complaint at work. ""Time is segmented, with people rushing from a project they're working on, to a meeting, and then back again,"" Leroy says. ""They assume their brain just moves along with them. But if you're working on an assignment until 2:59, and then rush off to a meeting at 3:00, you're going to have a hard time switching gears, not to mention resuming work on the original project when the meeting ends.""</p><p><strong>Try this:</strong> Imagine that your brain is a computer: If too many windows are open at once, Leroy says, the whole operating system slows down. ""So leave a trail of bread crumbs for your brain,"" she suggests. Before transitioning to a new project, jot down where you're leaving off on the old one-so you know exactly where to pick up when you get back to it. And before you jump back into it, devote a few minutes to recapping what you've just finished. It's simple, but it works.</p>",

""People often use the same boring ingredients, topped with a heavy, calorie-filled dressing. But it doesn't have to be that way,"" says Catherine Walthers, author of <i>Raising the Salad Bar</i>. The <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/summer-salads"">best salads</a> combine surprising, flavorful components that never leave your mouth underwhelmed or your stomach growling-and they deliver a helping of good-for-you nutrients. Here, the six essential steps to creating a superior salad.</p><p><strong>Get creative with your base</strong><br />A salad doesn't have to start with iceberg. Robust dark greens add power nutrients such as folate and vitamins A, C, and K for negligible calories, while the fiber and complex carbs in whole grains fill you up.</p><p><strong>Try one of these:</strong><br />1 1/2 cups romaine, Bibb, Boston, frisee, spinach, or arugula (or any combination)<br />1/2 cup cooked grains such as quinoa or whole-grain couscous<br />1 to 2 ounces soba noodles or whole-wheat linguine</p><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/2014/09/17/wh0711fl004-1_0.jpg"" /><br /><br />Levi Brown<p><strong>Pump up the protein</strong><br />Protein provides the belly-filling satisfaction that transforms a side salad into a main dish. Get your dose from lean sources such as chicken, fish, beans, or tofu.</p><p><strong>Try one of these:</strong><br />2 ounces fish, such as smoked, canned, or fresh salmon; trout; or smoked blue fish<br />5 large shrimp (broiled, boiled, or grilled) or 2 ounces lump crabmeat<br />3 ounces skinless chicken breast, broiled or grilled<br />1/4 to 1 cup cooked beans, such garbanzo, cannellini, or black<br />2 ounces marinated, cooked tofu</p><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/2014/09/17/wh0711fl002-1_0.jpg"" /><br /><br />Levi Brown<p><strong>Add color</strong><br />Vibrant produce doesn't just make your salad look pretty-it also ensures your dish is loaded with vitamins and other nutrients. Just one quarter of a red bell pepper provides more than 40 percent of the vitamin A you need in a day, while tomatoes are full of cancer-fighting lycopene. Beets are rich in potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure. </p><p><strong>Try one (or more!) of these:</strong><br />1/4 cup chopped red, yellow, or orange bell pepper<br />1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped red, yellow, orange, or green tomato (about 1 medium)<br />1/4 cup chopped red, golden, or Chioggia beets<br />1/4 cup shredded carrot<br />1 to 2 medium slices red onion</p><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/2014/09/17/wh0711fl001-1_0.jpg"" /><br /><br />Levi Brown<p><strong>Toss in something soft</strong><br />A touch of softness gives a salad balance and texture and makes it extra satiating. A soft cheese also provides calcium and protein, plus a hint of saltiness, says Walthers. Just be mindful of how much you toss in: Cheese and other rich ingredients can ratchet up the calorie count.</p><p><strong>Try one of these:</strong><br />1 to 2 teaspoons soft cheese, such as feta, goat, or blue cheese<br />1/8 avocado<br />1 heart of palm</p><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/2014/09/17/wh0711fl003-1_0.jpg"" /><br /><br />Levi Brown<p><strong>Fire up the flavor</strong><br />Spicy, tart, or sweet ingredients add a layer of depth and complexity to a salad and can offset some of the more bitter greens and veggies, says Patricia Wells, author of Salad as a Meal. For example, fresh fruit will satisfy a sweet tooth, while zingy fresh herbs boost flavor but not fat. </p><p><strong>Try one of these:</strong><br />1/2 cup citrus fruit, such as fresh orange, pear, or grapefruit<br />Tangy veggies such as radishes, scallions, chives, grated or pickled ginger, or jalapeno, to taste<br />Zesty herbs such as cilantro, basil, oregano, or tarragon, to taste</p><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/2014/09/17/wh0711fl005-1_0_0.jpg"" /><br /><br />Levi Brown<p><strong>Top it off with some crunch</strong><br />""Crispy, crunchy ingredients wake up your palate and are the perfect contrast to soft greens, noodles, and grains,"" says Wells. Nuts and seeds are great choices because they can squash a raging appetite, and many, including sunflower and pumpkin seeds, are top sources of antioxidants and vitamins. Homemade croutons take minutes to make and contain a fraction of the fat and calories of store-bought varieties. </p><p><strong>Try one of these:</strong><br />1 to 2 teaspoons nuts such as pecans, walnuts, peanuts, macadamia nuts, almonds, or pine nuts<br />1 to 2 teaspoons seeds such as pumpkin, sunflower, sesame, or poppy<br />1/8 cup whole-grain croutons (make your own by toasting a whole-wheat baguette or pita)</p>",

She's 25, and her cramps are out of control; her period is irregular at best. What's more, she's packed on 50 pounds in 18 months. Her general practitioner suspects and tests her thyroid. Normal. She's shuffled to a gynecologist, who orders a raft of blood work. Normal again. She's prescribed Advil for the pain and birth-control pills to regulate her cycle. Back home, she takes to the Web, searching for answers. And at a followup visit with her gyno, she timidly offers a diagnosis of her own: polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder that plagues some 5 million young women. ""Doubtful,"" says her doc. ""You don't fit the profile."" Though the classic PCOS patient is overweight, sufferers also have unnaturally high testosterone levels, something that's missing here. Besides, before her recent weight gain, she'd been slim and healthy, so she's likely just going through a normal postadolescent metabolic slowdown, says her M.D. She'll bounce back soon enough. Except that she doesn't-and two years later, after constant pain and countless more appointments, procedures, and tests, Alexa Stevenson of St. Paul, Minnesota, is finally correctly diagnosed by a reproductive endocrinologist with PCOS, the most common cause of infertility.<br /><br /><br /><br />What, were you expecting a punch line? Alexa's experience is no joke-in fact, it's alarmingly common. Tens of thousands of patients are misdiagnosed every year, according to the Institute of Medicine. In fact, medical mistakes are the eighth leading cause of death-higher than car accidents or even breast cancer. Alexa's diagnosis was fumbled because her birthcontrol pills lowered her testosterone level-something her gynecologist arguably should have deduced since she's the doctor who prescribed them in the first place, before checking her hormone levels. But Alexa is just one of the roughly 49 million Americans (many of them young women) who walk into their doctor's office with a problem and leave with a solution to something else.<br /><br /></p><p></p><p><strong>Behind the Mistakes</strong><br /><br /><br />For many women, ""the good old days of putting yourself in the capable hands of a doctor who knows you are over,"" says Peter J. Weiss, M.D., author of <i>More Health, Less Care: How to Take Charge of Your Medical Care and Write Your Own Personal Prescription for Lifelong Health</i>. Today's inundated clinics and vexing HMOs mean physicians are swamped-not to mention drowning in paperwork-and are more likely to pass patients around, especially in big private practices. Not seeing the same practitioner each time you visit raises your risk for a misdiagnosis; without background knowledge, says Weiss, it's much harder for a doc to nail what ails you. And if you happen to be a female in your twenties or thirties, your chance jumps even higher.<br /><br /><br /><br />It sounds strange, but young women's general good health can work against them. When dealing with a typically strong, fit demographic, doctors are less likely to look toward serious diagnoses. Take, for example, what happened to Emily Willingham of Austin, Texas. When she first saw a gastroenterologist for her relentless stomachaches at age 35, she was sent home with ibuprofen. Four years later, another M.D. discovered a precancerous three-inch-wide intestinal polyp. ""That first G.I. doc thought I was too young and too female to have colon problems,"" she remembers. ""But without treatment, I would have died of colon cancer.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Also contributing to misdiagnoses is that lots of young women use their gyno as their primary doctor, relying on a singlesubject- trained physician to diagnose all sorts of bodily woes, says gynecologist Shari Brasner, M.D., an assistant clinical professor at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. ""If a woman wakes up with ear pain, a gyno is not the right person to see."" Janet Taylor, M.D., a psychiatrist and health strategist in Manhattan, echoes that statement: ""Specialists are specialists for a reason; they focus on one area of the body. Even if you have a terrific relationship with your gynecologist, you should still seek out a general practitioner.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Of course, scheduling multiple appointments with multiple docs can be maddening (think: infuriating hold times). We don't have time to get sick, much less tend to our symptoms. As a result, when we finally find ourselves in an exam room, we're inclined to accept the first diagnosis that comes along so we can get out, get better, and get on with our lives. ""This mind-set really causes problems,"" says Taylor.<br /><br /><br /><br />Fortunately, there is a fix. What follows is crucial information on how to increase your chances of being correctly diagnosed off the bat and advice on the best ways to stay informed throughout your treatment.<br /><br /><br /></p><p><strong>Demystify Your Doc</strong><br /><br /><br />Something about a white coat renders even brave, bossy types meek and compliant. Women often hesitate to ask questions, says Weiss, especially when we're already feeling sick and vulnerable. Plus, we're shivering in skimpy paper gowns, and we address our docs with their professional titles (Dr. So-and-So), while they call us by our first names. ""All too often there is a parent-child relationship between doctors and patients, as opposed to an adult-adult interaction,"" explains Andrew Cook, M.D., of the Vital<br /><br /><br /><br />Health Institute in Los Gatos, California. And young women might succumb to an extra insecurity: We want our doctors to treat us kindly and give us optimal care, so we're inclined to be obedient, says Taylor. We're also more likely to lie about our health and feel embarrassed about discussing ""private"" physical symptoms (hello, itchy vaginal rash!), so we often keep mum to avoid being judged.<br /><br /><br /><br />But here's the thing: This isn't a scenario of us versus them. Women and their doctors are on the same team, so why shouldn't we be as vigilant when it comes to our health as we are at work or at home?<br /><br /></p><p></p><p>Before you even get into that paper gown, comparison shop. Suss out a practice in advance by reading reviews at sites like AngiesList.com. If the docs are booked till Christmas, ask to see a nurse practitioner instead-they are a good first step into a medical group, can prescribe meds, and are often more available than the physicians.<br /><br /><br /><br />While in research mode, don't let concern about ruffling anyone's feathers keep you from your homework. ""Arrogance and ego are real problems in the medical profession,"" but good docs welcome involved patients, says Richard Klein, M.D., author of <i>Surviving Your Doctors: Why the Medical System Is Dangerous to Your Health and How to Get Through It Alive</i>.<br /><br /><br /><br />In addition to asking lots of questions, keep close track of your medical history by filing away copies of your records and transferring them whenever you change docs. But even if you have charts dating back to childhood, don't assume your physician has digested everything. ""There really isn't enough time,"" says Adam Dickler, M.D., a radiation oncologist in Evergreen, Illinois. If your doctor flips open your file while entering the exam room, it may be the first time she's looking at it, so be ready with a recap. A full recap. ""The issue isn't always that doctors aren't looking at your info,"" says Taylor, ""it's that patients aren't giving enough information."" (Case in point: Emily Willingham didn't know to tell her first doc about her family's history of colon polyps.) ""Anyone who's ever seen an episode of <i>House</i> knows the importance patient history plays in a diagnosis,"" says PCOS sufferer Alexa Stevenson. ""And when it comes to how you've felt in the past, you are the only real expert.""<br /><br /><br /></p><p><strong>Double-Check Your Diagnosis</strong><br /><br /><br />There are thousands of medical diagnoses. But most doctors see only about 250 of them in the course of their career, leaving lots of room for error, says patient advocate Jason Maude, founder of Isabel Healthcare, which runs a diagnosis computer program for medical pros. Docs are taught that the obvious culprit is usually the right one- and it often is. But after diagnosing dozens of patients, it's tempting to jump to easy conclusions. Just imagine a physician has seen 10 cases of strep throat in the past 10 days. If you walk in with a sore throat, guess what's at the front of her mind?<br /><br /><br /><br />That preliminary diagnosis is critical- and tough to shake. Once your symptoms are given a name, the label tends to stick until overwhelming evidence (or your own persistence) compels alternate theories. Cook, for example, recently saw a patient in her twenties with excruciating pelvic pain that other docs believed was a psychological result of her history of sexual abuse. In reality, he says, she was suffering from endometriosis.<br /><br /><br /><br />Cutting-edge in-office online diagnosis aids like Isabel and UpToDate are starting to help doctors think outside their familiar 250 cases. But even with the best tools and the most open-minded physician, ""diagnosis is still a question of playing the odds,"" says Weiss. ""Even if I'm 99 percent sure you have a certain condition, there's always that 1 percent chance I'm wrong.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Tip the odds all the way by doing research before your appointment (remember, you're researching, not diagnosing) and reminding your M.D. that other possibilities could still exist. When you walk in with that sore throat, remember to ask, ""So you think I have strep, but what else could it be?""<br /><br /><br /><br />Most important, don't think twice about getting a second opinion. Many Americans shy away from having their diagnoses double-checked; that's especially bad news for women, since female-specific illnesses like ovarian cancer are frequently misdiagnosed. A smart doctor should never feel offended or threatened by a backup opinion, particularly if it's from a specialist, says Dickler. ""Many women have a fear of insulting their doctors,"" he says, ""but getting a second opinion is a patient's right.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Still feeling bashful? Start thinking of your health as your most important investment. ""We spend so much money on health care that we're entitled to get the correct diagnosis,"" says Taylor. ""You owe it to yourself to get a second opinion.""<br /><br /></p><p></p><p><strong>Be an empowered patient</strong><br /><br /><br />Once the diagnostic process is over, you may be tempted to just sit back and swallow your meds. But one-size-fits-all solutions don't always apply in medicine. Every young woman reacts differently to her treatment, so make sure you get the lowdown on possible side effects and continue to monitor your body closely. If prescription pills aren't helping, ask for a list of alternatives. ""Many traditions are related to health and healing,"" says Weiss. ""But doctors come from just one tradition-medical school- so they might automatically prescribe drugs instead of, say, massage or acupuncture.""<br /><br /><br /><br />If your treatment is over but you still feel lousy, schedule another appointment...stat. Your M.D. won't know you're still sick if you don't tell her. ""I always remind my patients that the follow-up is essential,"" says Napoleon Knight, M.D., vice president and associate medical director of the Carle Foundation Hospital in Urbana, Illinois. ""If you're not getting better, it's your responsibility to come back in."" Because although it's a doc's job to solve your medical problems, no one really cares more about your health than you do.<br /><br /><br /></p>",

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/boost-mood,Life,59,66,25,9,22,5,7,0,,The Easiest Way to Fight Depression,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/book-mind-body.jpg,"<p>Sunlight brightens your mood. Just about everyone, regardless of whether or not they suffer from depression, feels better when the sun comes out. What most people experience intuitively has come to be understood scientifically in the past two decades: Exposure to sunlight boosts serotonin levels in the brain. Sunlight (or bright light, to be more exact) is the most abundant and easiest to absorb anti-depressant you will find. To receive your daily dose of bright light all you need to do is open your eyes. When bright light reaches the retina it stimulates the optic nerve, which sends a signal to the part of the brain that regulates production of serotonin and melatonin.You will recall that serotonin is the same neurotransmitter that is boosted by Prozac, Paxil, and the other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors.It relieves stressful feelings and produces a general sense of well-being. For depression, bright light works faster than medication, usually within a week, and with fewer side effects. Drugs that boost serotonin generally take two to four weeks before beginning to work, and in some cases up to six weeks.</p><p>Bright light has been used as a treatment for winter depression for over twenty-five years. Its efficacy in treating winter depression, also known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD), has been supported by dozens of studies. As the days get shorter, cloudier and colder in the winter months, people with SAD frequently suffer from fatigue, irritability, depression, carbohydrate craving, sleep problems and weight gain. Exposure to bright light from the sun or a high intensity light fixture for 30-60 minutes a day is remarkably effective in alleviating the symptoms of SAD.</p><p>More recently, we have found that bright light is also effective in treating depression that arrives in seasons other than winter.Over fifteen controlled studies have demonstrated that bright light is helpful for people suffering from non-seasonal depression. This confirms what I have observed with my clients. In fact, people with a variety of other conditions, including PMS, depression during pregnancy, bulimia, and insomnia, havealso shown improvement from exposure to high intensity light.</p><p>Are you getting enough bright light? If you're like many Americans, you may not be. As we spend more of our time indoors we are becoming increasingly deprived of the bright light that is essential to our health and well-being. For most of human history, people spent almost all of their waking hours outdoors. Our brains and bodies evolved in an outdoor environment bathed in sunlight. Our eyes have special light receptors, connected directly to the middle of the brain, that respond only to the brightness of outdoor light. That light, absorbed by the eyes, stimulates the release of neurotransmitters and hormones that regulate mood, sleep, and energy. Without it, our natural sleep-wake cycle goes awry and our mood and energy suffer. </p><p>Many of us are not aware that we are light deprived and suffering from the effects of light deprivation. Because of our eyes' extraordinary ability to adapt to changes in brightness, we tend not to be aware of how little light we actually receive when we are indoors. Typical indoor lighting is 100 times less bright than outdoor light on a sunny day. Even a cloudy day delivers ten times more brightness than ordinary indoor lighting.</p><p>Many people who live in the northern United States feel less happy and more sluggish in the winter. People who live in sunny climates tend to feel happier than people in darker environments. A recent survey of 1.3 million Americans found that those who live in the sunniest states tend to report the highest levels of happiness. The top seven happiest states in the 50 state survey were all in the Sun Belt (in order): Louisiana, Hawaii, Florida, Tennessee, Arizona, South Carolina, and Mississippi.</p><p>The best way to get the mood enhancing benefit of bright light is to spend at least thirty minutes a day outdoors. Walking outside on a sunny day is an ideal way to combine exercise, light exposure, and the beauty of nature. In order to receive the mood-boosting effect, the light needs to be absorbed through your eyes, so do not wear sunglasses. You do not need to look up at the sun. Simply being outdoors will enable you to absorb the light you need.</p><p>On a snowy, rainy, cloudy or very cold day, it may not be practical or possible to get thirty minutes of exposure to bright sunlight. If you can't get thirty minutes of sunshine outdoors, a high intensity light box can provide the boost you need.</p><p>A high intensity light box offers a convenient and reliable way to receive your daily dose of bright light. To receive maximum benefit, the light fixture must provide 10,000 lux of light at a distance of two feet.Lux is a measure of brightness. On a sunny day, the brightness of sunlight is anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 lux. In contrast, typical indoor lighting is only about 100 lux! That's why a high intensity light box provides such a powerful lift to light-deprived people who spend little time outdoors. It gives them a blast of light that approximates the mood-boosting brightness of sunlight.</p><p>There are many high intensity light boxes available, ranging in price from about $100 to $500. In selecting a model, choose a fixture that has an adjustable stand. The light should be about 18-24 inches in front of you. You can set the light fixture on a desk or table so that it is about six inches above eye level, shining down into your eyes. This approximates the angle at which outdoor sunlight hits the eyes. It is the best angle for stimulating the light sensors in the eyes. You should not look directly into the light, as this can hurt your eyes. You can receive your light exposure while you read, work at your computer, or eat breakfast. You can also get your daily dose of light while watching television or walking on your treadmill. The diagram on the opposite page shows how to position the light fixture for optimal benefit.</p><p>High intensity light boxes contain fluorescent bulbs, which are cooler and last longer than incandescent bulbs. Some fluorescent bulbs flicker, which may cause eyestrain and headache. Look for a light box that uses flicker-free technology. Two s excellent, relatively inexpensive models are the Day-Light DL930 by Uplift Technologies and the Sunsation by the Sunbox Company. Both can be purchased for less than $200. You should also check your health insurance policy, as some insurance providers will cover the full or partial cost of a light box.</p><p>Excerpted from <i>The Mind-Body Mood Solution</i>, Jeffrey Rossman, PhD, $25.99, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.rodalestore.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10002&storeId=10051&productId=237134&langId=-1&nav_wt=search"">RodaleStore.com</a></p>",

We asked fitness club owners, doctors, nutrition gurus, and trainers to share their insider info so you can make the most of every dollar.<br /><br /><b>Cardio</b><p></p><p><b>Pick the right tunes.</b> Keep your body moving at a fat-frying pace with songs between 130 and 170 beats per minute, says Corry Matthews, a Gold's Gym Fitness Institute expert trainer. For reference, Kelly Clarkson's ""Since U Been Gone"" clocks in at about 130 and the Beastie Boys' ""Sabotage"" at around 170.

Or download user-submitted playlists at <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://fitpod.com/"">fitPod</a>.<br /><br /><b>Change up your footing.</b> On bikes, stair steppers, and elliptical machines, push with different parts of your feet. ""Push with your toes and give your quads an extra workout,"" says Lindsay Dunlap, creator of the Fat Fighters program at Sports Club/LA in New York City. ""If you push with your heels, you work your butt and hamstrings more.""<br /><br /><b>Don't waste time in line (Part 1).</b> Favorite machine taken? Try something different. You might get even better results.<br /><br /><b>Popular: Treadmill</b> <br /><b>Alternate: Stepmill</b> (old-school escalator-like thingy) If you increase the speed and stand tall, you'll burn up to 200 more calories an hour than you would on a treadmill, says Eddie Carrington, a personal trainer at Bally Total Fitness in New York City. ""We have five in our gym, and rarely are they all taken."" <br /><br /><b>Popular: Elliptical trainer</b><br /><b>Alternate: Recumbent bike</b> ""They both decrease stress on the knees, shins, and ankles,"" Carrington says. ""On the bike, use 2- or 3-pound dumbbells, punching forward at shoulder height to simulate the elliptical's push-pull arm movement."" <br /><br /><b>Popular: Stationary bike</b><br /><b>Alternate: Rowing machine</b> Rowing burns 40 to 50 percent more fat than cycling because it also works the upper body.<br /><br /><b>Free Weights</b></p><p><b>De-bug your dumbbells.</b> Neoprene weights may be easier on your hands than metal ones, says Kelly Reynolds, Ph.D., a microbiologist at the University of Arizona. But they're also more hospitable to bacteria and viruses. So either stick with old-fashioned dumbbells or bring along a 4-ounce bottle of Clorox Anywhere ($2, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://clorox.com"">Clorox</a>) and spray the weights and benches. ""It has a chlorine bleach that kills 99.9 percent of bacteria on contact, but it doesn't stain fabrics and doesn't need to be wiped,"" Reynolds says. Other disinfectant sprays and wipes can take 10 minutes to kill germs.<br /><br /><b>Jockey for the adjustable bench.</b> By varying the angle of the bench, you'll hit the muscle from every direction. For example, to work the mid, upper, and lower chest equally, do one set of dumbbell chest presses on a flat bench. Incline it to 45 degrees for the next set, then decline it to 30 degrees below flat for the final set.<br /><br /><b>Weight Machines</b></p><p><b>Get a bonus ab workout.</b> Work your core when using upper-body machines by placing your feet close together or lifting them off the ground, Dunlap says. On lower-body machines, tone your midsection by folding your arms across your chest or clasping your hands behind your back instead of grabbing the handles.<br /><br /><b>Be super.</b> Get your heart pounding (read: burn more blubber) by working two muscle groups back to back with no rest in between (also known as supersetting). Target opposing muscle groups for balanced results without overworking any one muscle, says Todd Durkin, personal trainer and owner of Fitness Quest 10 in San Diego. He recommends pairing bench presses with lat pulldowns and leg extensions with leg curls. <br /><br /><b>Don't waste time in line (Part 2).</b> This time, ditch the machine and try these just-as-challenging moves.<br /><br /><b>Popular: Hip Adductor/Abductor</b> (works inner and outer thighs)<br /><b>Alternate: Wide-Stance Squat</b> Grab two 5- to 8-pound dumbbells and stand with legs wider than your shoulders, feet turned out 45 degrees. Bend your knees and bring the dumbbells straight down in front of you so they're between your legs. Slowly lower your hips until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Then press up to standing. Complete 12 reps.<br /><br /><b>Popular: Lat Pulldown</b> (works back and biceps)<br /><b>Alternate: One-Arm Dumbbell Row</b> Grab a 3- to 8-pound dumbbell in your right hand and stand facing a bench. Get in a lunge position, then bend at the waist and place your left palm on the bench. Let your right arm hang at your side. Pull your elbow toward the ceiling until the dumbbell reaches chest level. Lower and repeat. Do 12, then repeat on the other side. Complete three sets, resting 30 to 60 seconds in between.<br /><br /><b>Popular: Leg Press</b> (works glutes, hamstrings, and quads)<br /><b>Alternate: Lunge with Dumbbells</b> Studies show that lunges work the glutes 20 percent harder than leg presses. Hold 5- to 10-pound dumbbells and lunge with your right foot forward. Press back up through your right heel. Step your right foot back in line with your left, then repeat, lunging with your left leg. Alternate until you've done 12 reps on each side. Do three sets, resting 30 to 60 seconds in between. <br /><br /><b>Group Fitness </b></p><p><b>Sign up for class.</b> Need motivation? A 2006 A.C. Nielsen survey of 1,000 group fitness participants found that they visited the gym an average of 2.9 times a week. Gym members who don't take classes show their face about half as often, according to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association.<br /><br /><b>Choose wisely.</b> Spinning, step, and Tae Bo classes burn as many calories as 45 minutes of running at a 10-minute-mile pace, according to a 2006 study in the <i>Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research</i>. While great for bone and muscle building, body-sculpting classes burn far fewer calories. Best bet: Tae Bo, which tones your body and zaps mucho calories.<br /><br /><b>Juice Bar</b></p><p><b>Java up.</b> Contrary to popular belief, caffeine doesn't dehydrate you, according to a 2005 study in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism. ""A cup of black coffee before a workout can boost energy levels and increase calorie burn,"" says Molly Morgan, R.D., founder of Creative Nutrition Solutions in Vestal, New York.<br /><br /><b>Bounce back fast.</b> You could waste time and brain power calculating the perfect carb-protein combo for your postworkout fix. Or you could just grab a 12-ounce glass of low-fat chocolate milk. ""It has the ideal ratio of carbs to protein for recovery,"" says Molly Kimball, R.D., of Ochsner's Elmwood Fitness Center in New Orleans.<br /><br /><b>Avoid protein boosts.</b> ""On average, a 130-pound woman needs 71 to 100 grams of protein per day,"" Morgan says. Many shakes pack 40 grams or more - too many on top of a typical nonvegetarian diet. Plus, these juice bar specials tend to be high in calories. And extra calories - even ""healthy"" ones - get stored as fat.<br /><br /><b>Locker Room</b></p><p><b>Suss out the towels.</b> Unless they're bleached, community towels can be dirtier than Chris Rock's stand-up routine. Germs survive regular washing, according to Reynolds - so ask the manager whether the gym's laundry always uses bleach. If not, bring your own towels. <br /><br /><b>Secure your stuff.</b> Any gear worth owning is worth locking up. Pick up a Masterlock G.l.o. padlock ($14, masterlock.com), which has a cool easy-to-spot LED-lit dial and is twice as strong as an ordinary combination lock.<br /><br /><b>Warm up before your massage.</b> Step into the sauna for 10 minutes to prep for a recovery rubdown. ""By dilating the peripheral blood vessels and increasing circulation into the muscles, you're helping your massage therapist be more effective,"" says Gary Brazina, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon in Los Angeles.<br /><br /></p>",Getting Started

Here's what to look for:</p><p><strong>Mouth</strong></p><p><strong>White Tongue Coating</strong><br />Could mean: You have a yeast infection-the oral type, that is, says Bruce Robinson, M.D., of the American Academy of Dermatology. Your mouth maintains a fine yeast-bacteria balance, but when foreign stuff (think: antibiotics) throws that out of whack, the yeast portion grows unchecked and coats your tongue. A prescription antifungal rinse should clear things up. If it doesn't, revisit your doc.</p><p><strong>Inflamed Gums </strong><br />Could mean: You're knocked up. ""Your dentist is often the first to know,"" says Sassan Rastegar, D. D. S., a dentist in New York City. ""Swollen gums are one of the early side effects of the hormonal changes that come with pregnancy."" If your gums are puffy or bleed when you floss-and your period is late-it may be time to take a pregnancy test.</p><p><strong>Cracked Mouth Corners </strong><br />Could mean: You're vitamin deficient, says Wilma Bergfeld, M. D., a dermatologist at the Cleveland Clinic. (""Otherwise,"" she says, ""you're a big lip licker. Stop that!"") A lack of B vitamins- specifically, B2, B6, and folic acid-can dry out the sensitive skin on the outer corners of your mouth, causing unseemly cracks on your kisser. Adding nutrient-rich eats such as leafy greens and watermelon to your regular diet should smooth out any rough patches, says Vandana Y. Bhide, M. D., a board-certified internist in St. Augustine, Florida.</p><p><strong>Eyes</strong></p><p><strong>Sparse Outer Eyebrows</strong><br />Could mean: Your thyroid isn't pumping out enough hormones, says internist Jacob Teitelbaum, M.D., author of <em>From Fatigued to Fantastic!</em> More than 27 million Americans have thyroid disorders, and eight out of 10 of those are women. The right prescription meds should get your hormones- and brows-back on track.</p><p><strong>Dark Under-Eye Circles </strong><br />Could mean: You may have allergies, says Jennifer Wider, M. D., of the Society for Women's Health Research. Nasal congestion from allergies can dilate and darken the veins around your eyes and nose. Once you pinpoint and treat your allergen culprits-often with OTC meds-your under-eye shadows should fade.</p><p><strong>Hair</strong></p><p><strong>Thinning Hair</strong><br />Could mean: You have a thyroid issue. If you've been noticing more breakage when you blow-dry, head to your G. P. for a thyroid test, says Kent Holtorf, M. D., founder of the Holtorf Medical Group in Los Angeles. Brittle hair can also be a sign of malnourishment-specifically, deficiencies in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin A. So for the love of your hair (and your health), steer clear of any lownutrient crash diets.</p><p><strong>Skin</strong></p><p><strong>Brown Splotches</strong><br />Could mean: You've had a self-tanner mishap...or you have a benign condition called melasma that's often associated with oral contraceptives, says Dina D. Strachan, M. D., a dermatologist in New York City. Doctors aren't sure why some birth-control pills cause these dark patches on the forehead, cheeks, or upper lip, but they do know UV exposure makes them worse. Your M. D. might recommend a hydroquinone cream.</p><p><strong>Small Yellow Bumps</strong><br />Could mean: You're looking at fat deposits caused by high cholesterol, says Svetlana Kogan, M. D., an internist in New York City. The yellowish bulges can appear anywhere (yes, on thin people too) but are most common on the knees, elbows, hands, and feet. Make an appointment with your doc for a simple blood cholesterol test.</p><p><strong>A Rash on Your Rump </strong><br />Could mean: Celiac disease, which is triggered by eating gluten, can manifest itself as an itchy red rash or blisters on your derriere. Ten to 15 percent of people with gluten intolerance get this inflammation, which can also appear on your elbows and knees, says Howard Sobel, M. D., a cosmetic dermatologist in New York City. Fortunately, once you cut pasta, wheat bread, and other gluten sources from your diet, you'll kick the butt blisters too.</p><p><strong>Nails</strong></p><p><strong>Brittle Nails</strong><br />Could mean: Your frail nails might indicate nutritional deficiencies like low calcium, vitamin D, or zinc, says Andrea Cambio, M.D., a dermatologist in Cape Coral, Florida. Sporting nude nails more often and maintaining a balanced diet may help. Or you can try soaking your nails in water for five minutes at night before moisturizing them with an alpha hydroxy cream.</p>",

Toss aside the raised emotions and the nitty-gritty of the disagreement. Concentrate on the actual flow of the discussion. Are you trying to resolve the situation-or do you just want to win?</p><p>If you always have an ""I'm right"" attitude during relationship fights, your arguments aren't serving their purpose. A constructive dustup should leave you both feeling like you understand each other better-not that one of you is the victor. The key is to stop competing and start <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/relationship-problems"">communicating</a>. Use these four tips to learn how to butt heads in a way that brings you closer.</p><p><strong>1. Ask yourself what you'd really be winning.</strong><br />Arguing erodes relationships. Couples who squabble frequently are often less happy than those who don't bicker as much. So is it really worth racking up another fight to have your guy admit he made a wrong turn three stoplights ago? Think about what you're really irked by-maybe the stoplight skirmish is about how you don't feel as if you have a voice in decisions-and whether there's another, less heated conversation you should be having.</p><p><strong>2. Stop seeing him as a competitor.</strong><br />Mates are called partners for a reason: You're supposed to work with them! Many of us forget that and just want to control the relationship. But striving to always be right means wanting him to always be wrong-and that's not a desire motivated by love or affection.</p><p><strong>3. Fight clean.</strong><br />When you do quarrel, these guidelines will help ensure the claws stay sheathed: Don't name-call or compare your partner with people you know he hates. Try not to interrupt, bring up ancient mistakes, or be cruel. Ask him to do the same, and agree that during a fight, you'll each be able to explain your side while the other person really listens (and doesn't just wait for their turn to make their point). This will help you go from thinking <em>I won</em> at the end of a fight to <em>I get it</em>.</p><p><strong>4. And finally, move on.</strong><br />It's really hard not to rehash old fights (we love to keep score), but once a disagreement is over, it should really be over. Bringing it up again should make you feel as if you're eating leftovers from a dinner that wasn't very good in the first place. The nice thing is, the more you communicate and empathize with each other, the less likely you are to revive old battles. Then everyone wins!</p><p><em>Lauren Zander is a life coach and cofounder of the coaching firm the Handel Group (handelgroup.com).

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/energy-pill-dangers,Health,18,59,8,55,3,6,4,0,,The Dangers of Energy Pills,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0912-pill-power-cord.jpg,"<p>It's 10:30 on a Friday night, and Amanda*, a magazine editor in New York City, is the last one in the office. Again. Not that she's complaining. Fact is, the 30-year-old has ridden successive waves of promotions in her brief career, largely because she possesses a blend of talent, smarts, and stamina that's hard to come by. But she has something else in her get-ahead arsenal: a secret stash of little blue-and-white pills.<br /><br />Amanda got the drugs about a year ago, after those 60-hour workweeks began to leave her mentally unraveled. ""I visited my family over the holidays, and they saw I was struggling,"" she says. By chance, her brother had just been prescribed an amphetamine to treat his attention deficit disorder, and he offered her five pills as a stocking stuffer, telling her, ""Trust me, they'll give you all the energy you'll need.""<br /><br />Days later at the office, she swallowed one halfway through a brutal afternoon that involved writing two last-minute stories, scheduling appointments with publicists, and arranging an upcoming photo shoot. The result: ""My ability to focus was insane,"" Amanda says. ""I cleaned out my inbox, which had been overflowing for weeks, banged out pages of copy, and brainstormed a bunch of ideas. Even deadlines, which usually made me anxious, were no match for my productivity.""<br /><br />Over the next few months, Amanda used up her illicit stash and then bummed a couple dozen more pills from a friend who wasn't using his prescription. She now has one pill left and is trying to draw the line on her use. Still, she's hanging on to the phone number of a friend-of-a-friend who deals in black-market pharmaceuticals. ""It's an internal struggle not to call him and place an order,"" she admits.<br /><br /><strong>Salvation in a Bottle</strong><br />It used to be that medicine was for making sick people better. Now, overworked career women and overwhelmed moms are dabbling in ""cosmetic neurology,"" an emerging (and controversial) field that deals with mind-and performance-enhancing drugs-sometimes obtained legally, sometimes not. These prescriptions, say advocates, help them outshine coworkers, propel them through their at-home to-do lists, and give them charisma in social situations. But what these women may not realize is that every time they pop a ""miracle pill,"" they're also experimenting with their health.<br /><br />Why would anyone have such a cavalier attitude toward taking pills? ""People who came of age in the past decade are so comfortable with prescription drugs for ADHD and pain relief they've been dubbed Generation Rx,"" says Leonore Tiefer, Ph.D., a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine. In fact, according to data from IMS Health, a health-care research firm, the presence of stimulants alone in American culture has practically tripled since 1998, with about 40 million prescriptions dispensed last year. And the more pills that float around in pockets and medicine cabinets, ""the more opportunity there is for them to get into the hands of people they weren't prescribed for,"" says osteopathic physician Neil Capretto, medical director of the Gateway Rehabilitation Center in Pittsburgh. Today, the attention-deficit drugs methylphenidate and amphetamine/dextroamphetamine are the most abused substances on college campuses. But coeds don't always shake free from their reliance after graduation; 11 to 15 percent of adults in their twenties admit to using prescription drugs for ""nonmedical"" purposes.<br /><br />One type that's gaining popularity amongst postgrads is modafinil (better known by its brand name, Provigil), a medication officially approved to ""improve wakefulness"" in people with certain narrowly defined conditions such as narcolepsy and sleep apnea. The blog chatter among high-octane female execs reads something like this: ""Provigil rocks! To-do lists that used to vex me seem to complete themselves!"" It bears noting that modafinil sales have more than doubled since 2004 and now approach $1 billion annually.<br /><br />Sometimes, women turn to drugs not to be more productive, but to calm down. That's where popular antianxiety meds like lorazepam, alprazolam, and clonazepam come in. Carrie, a former member of the Cornell University swim team, started taking clonazepam after a panicky moment before the start of an important meet. Her doctor prescribed drugs even though she was never diagnosed with any clinical anxiety disorder. Now 23 years old and working for a sportswear company in New Jersey, she still digs a pill out of her purse whenever panic starts to well up inside her. ""When you have a lot going on and you want to do everything perfectly,"" she says, ""it's hard not to seek help.""<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/pills"">Have you ever taken meds (such as amphetamines, anti-anxiety pills or beta blockers) to get an edge? Tell us about it.</a><br /><br /> <strong>Scoring the Goods</strong><br />And help is often as close as the nearest doctor's office. In one study, actors who posed as patients and requested specific prescriptions were successful more than half the time. Physicians are sometimes so quick to pull out the white pad, you don't even have to go to the trouble of asking. Emily, a 40-year-old daycare provider from Traverse City, Michigan, told her doctor she wished she had more energy during the day. ""Try this,"" he told her, passing a prescription for an amphetamine.<br /><br />Women who can't easily convince an M.D. to issue a prescription often turn to the web. Last year, a third of subscribers to the science journal <em>Nature</em> who admitted to using drugs for ""cognitive enhancement"" obtained their supply over the Internet. Others, no doubt, scavenged pills from their friends and family. In a study released last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 29 percent of women admitted to sharing or borrowing prescription drugs. Sometimes, the lending happens involuntarily: ""I treated one woman who regularly dipped into her 8-year-old son's ADHD medication,"" says Capretto.<br /><br /><strong>The Lasting Effect of a Quick Fix</strong><br />If you sit next to an Energizer Bunny like Amanda at work, part of you may wonder if a pill is your ticket to having it all. But as daycare worker Emily discovered, gaining an edge can have scary side effects. A few months after taking an amphetamine, she noticed her heart would race for no reason and she'd break out in drenching sweats. She abandoned the drug and the M.D. who gave it to her. ""I'd rather be a little mentally fuzzy than dead,"" she says.<br /><br />Experts warn of other dangers too. Drugs like these are designed for specific medical purposes, so if you're healthy, you may be tinkering with neurological wiring that's already working the way it's supposed to. ""When drugs are used for reasons besides those that are approved, you're flying blind,"" says general internist Lisa Schwartz, M.D., a professor of medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice. ""A lot of these drugs are so new, the risk of serious complications isn't yet clear. They should be used only under a doctor's supervision."" The proven side effects are alarming enough: Read the warning label for Amanda's ADHD drug and you'll find phrases like heart attack and sudden death in tiny type.<br /><br />And then, of course, there's the potential for addiction. ""If you're healthy, taking these kinds of drugs puts you on thin ice,"" Capretto says. ""If you have a tendency toward addiction, you don't know how thin your ice is."" Even some modafinil fans, comforted by the drug's reputation for safety, were taken aback after a report in the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association </em>warned it could become addictive.<br /><br />Another pitfall: Once you're comfortable taking one drug, it's easy to start justifying popping others. ""If one pill gives you a desired effect (say, amps your energy level), you might try another kind to fix a different type of problem (maybe help you sleep). Soon, you're relying on a drug to manipulate every aspect of your life,"" warns Capretto. ""But know this: Each of these drugs brings possible side effects, which in combination can be dangerous. You might wind up with a laundry list of complications-paranoia, hypertension, heart palpitations, to name a few-as more drugs are brought into the mix. Toss in a few after-work cocktails, and things could get even dicier.""<br /><br />Adding to the danger: You may develop a tolerance to your medication. At first, taking a single daily dose of, say, alprazolam may give you peace of mind. But six weeks later, you may need three pills a day to achieve the same effect; a few months later, you may be downing five pills a night to get that warm-and-fuzzy feeling. ""The drugs you originally took to get an edge can become something you need just to get back to the way you were functioning before you started on meds,"" explains Capretto.<br /><br /> <strong>A New Normal </strong><br />Side effects aside, experts have other concerns about popping pills. One such fear is that drugs could redefine the idea of what's ""normal"" and set a standard of risky, pill-assisted perfection. ""Once half your office is pulling chemically assisted all-nighters, your [normal level of] productivity may start to look deficient,"" says Martha Farah, Ph.D., director of the Center for Neuroscience and Society at the University of Pennsylvania. ""Will you feel pressure to start extending your waking hours just to keep up?""<br /><br />What's more, doctors worry that these meds will become a crutch that keeps you from making important changes in your life. By opting for a quick fix, you may be tempted to put off finding healthier solutions like figuring out how to manage your time better, learning new relaxation techniques, or having that get-it-off-your-chest talk with your guy. ""If drugs are something you rely on,"" says Capretto, ""you need to take a close look at your life.""<br /><br />Even so, he and others predict that the popularity of prescription enhancers will continue. As long as the drugs offer short-term benefits, people will be drawn to them. That's why some experts suggest that instead of saying whether drugs should be used, we should determine how they should be used. Researchers are already conducting experiments involving emergency-room physicians to see whether drugs like modafinil could reduce the risk of fatigue-related errors.<br /><br />The concern that it's wrong to use a drug just because it's a drug doesn't make sense, according to Farah. If it helps you get more work done or improves the quality or safety of the work you do, she says, ""that weighs in the drug's favor. Do we want to be prissy and say, 'Oh, but it's unethical to use performance-enhancing drugs?' "" Use among healthy people should depend on the drug and the situation-as long as everyone is clear about the risks.<br /><br />""Look, a lot of people use these drugs because they work. But you have to exercise caution and really think things through,"" Capretto says. ""Before you even hand your pharmacist a prescription to fill, have a plan in mind. Ask yourself: Where am I going with this? Do I plan to be on these pills for one week? two weeks? a month? There's a saying: 'Don't lift an airplane off the ground unless you know how to land it.' That same cogency should be applied to prescription drug use.""<br /><br /><strong>*</strong> <em>All names and some identifying details have been changed. </em><br /> </p>",energy

According to a Neurology study, your headache risk jumps 8 percent each time the temperature climbs nine degrees. Heat may make the blood vessels in your skull expand and press up against surrounding nerve endings, creating a very sensitive situation.<br /><br /><br /><br />As a result, even normal blood flow can feel like a jackhammer drilling through your cranium, says neurologist Alexander Mauskop, M.D., founder of the New York Headache Center. But although headaches are people's number one physical woe-and women get them more often than men do-you can stop the throbbing and get back to the beach.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Tension Headaches</strong><br /><br /><br />These zingers, which feel like a giant rubber band wrapped around your brain, affect 78 percent of Americans and can strike up to 15 times a month. ""They come from stiffness in your neck, forehead, scalp, and face,"" says Mauskop, as overly taut muscles irritate nerve endings, which relay pain signals to the brain. Anything from stress to fatigue can get one going.<br /><br /><br /><strong><i>Treat them:</i></strong> Pop an OTC painkiller-whether it's aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen-at the first sign of scalp tightness. You can also try massaging a muscle-relaxing lidocaine-based gel on your shoulders and neck, says Mauskop.<br /><br /><br /><strong><i>Prevent them:</i></strong> Start sweating! Sofa spuds are 14 percent more likely to get tension headaches than those who frequent the gym. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.whdailyfix.com/?keycode=142693"">Exercise is a natural stress buster</a> that prompts your body to release painkilling endorphins, explains Merle Diamond, M.D., codirector of the Diamond Headache Clinic in Chicago. It also strengthens blood-vessel muscles against headache-inducing inflammation.<br /><br /></p><p></p><p><strong>Sinus Headaches</strong><br /><br /><br />Anything that irritates your sinuses-a cold, allergies, malodorous cologne-can inflame them, leaving you with painful pounding around your eyes. And sinus infections can make things worse. ""The pressure inside your sinuses should naturally match the atmospheric pressure,"" explains Kenneth Mukamal, M.D., an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. So if you're already stuffy when a pressure-altering summer storm rolls in, your sinuses can't readily adjust and you could end up with an even more intense hurt between your brows.<br /><br /><br /><strong><i>Treat them:</i></strong> Lay a warm damp cloth over your eyes to relieve inflammation, and use an OTC nasal spray to knock out congestion. If symptoms last longer than four days, see your doctor, says Mauskop.<br /><br /><br /><strong><i>Prevent them:</i></strong> Replace the filters in your air conditioner with new HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) ones that screen out the pollen, dust, mold, and airborne bacteria that can cause nasal inflammation. If you're prone to allergies, try using a neti pot (a teakettle-like device that's used to irrigate the sinuses with a warm saline solution) twice a week.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Migraines</strong><br /><br /><br />The mother of all noggin pain, migraines can be triggered by a variety of stimuli-including stress, bright light, too much or too little sleep, hunger, and hormonal fluctuations-that engorge your brain's bloodvessels. The resulting nerve pain leads to a piercing misery that lasts anywhere from four hours to three days. Scientists are studying why some women are more susceptible to migraines than others are, but they think DNA is involved; about 80 percent of sufferers have a family history. If you're not sure whether your headaches fit the migraine bill, check if you meet two of the three criteria doctors use to make a diagnosis: pain that keeps you from your normal life activities, sensitivity to light, and nausea.<br /><br /><br /><strong><i>Treat them:</i></strong> Swallowing OTC painkillers has little effect. An ice pack can offer some relief, but most sufferers use prescription meds called triptans, which work in part by constricting the blood vessels around your brain. They're most effective if taken at the first sign of pain.<br /><br /><br /><strong><i>Prevent them:</i></strong> Have your doctor check your magnesium level to determine if you need a supplement. The mineral is closely tied to serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates blood-vessel function; inadequate amounts of magnesium can hinder serotonin production and lead to inflammation. Another natural alternative? Acupuncture. A 2009 study found it to be more effective at relieving migraines than some preventative Rx treatments. Finally, something decidedly less organic: According to a study in the Archives of Dermatology, women who got just a single dose of Botox in the forehead say their migraine incidences fell from seven days a month to one.<br /><br /><br /></p>",Better Sex
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/get-amazing-abs,Weight Loss,97,58,15,12,7,402,2,0,,"The Abs Diet: Eat More, Weigh Less",http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0410-abs-diet-eat-0033.jpg," <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/free-abs-diet-workout-and-meal-plan""><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/images/abs-diet-quickstart/abs-button-back.jpg"" /><br /><br /></a><br /><br />For years - or maybe for all your life - you've probably had one notion about what dieting needs to be. Starve yourself like a supermodel, sweat on the treadmill, and lose weight. In reality, those could be the very reasons you can't lose fat. If you're restricted in what you eat, you'll eventually act like a rebellious teen and break the rules. And if the only exercise you do is the aerobic kind, sure, you'll burn calories, but you won't do anything to fire up your body's long-lasting fat-burner - your metabolism.<br /><br />That's why this eating and exercise plan - which I call The Abs Diet - is different and especially suited to women, whether you want to tighten your tummy, slim down your thighs and butt, or gain precious energy. <br /><br />The meal plan isn't about deprivation; it's about building your diet around healthy sources of protein, fiber, and other nutrients that help you burn fat. And the exercise plan focuses not on burning calories, but on building lean muscle, which exponentially speeds up the fat-burning process. <br /><br />Whether you want to change your body to improve your health, looks, fitness, sex appeal - or just feel better about yourself all over - this plan offers you a simple promise: It can transform your body so you can accomplish all of those goals. And still have the energy you need to make each day a good one.<br /><br /><b>Principles of the abs diet</b><br /><br />Most people who are embarking on a new mission begin with one fundamental question: When do we eat? Good question. Most diets are all about what foods you'll cut out. This one is all about what you'll include. And that's good news, because if you want to emerge on the other side of this plan with a new body, you must have the flexibility and freedom to keep yourself from getting hungry, and the knowledge that you can eat well no matter what. <br /><br />So let's see what's on the menu.<br /><br /><b>Guideline 1</b><p></p><p><b>Eat Six Meals a Day</b><br /><br />Didn't I tell you that this is not about deprivation?<br /><br />We're so used to hearing people talk about eating less food that it's become weight-loss doctrine. The new philosophy that I want you to keep in mind is ""energy balance.""<br /><br />Researchers at Georgia State University developed a technique to measure hourly energy balance - that is, how many calories you're burning versus how many calories you're taking in. The researchers found that if you keep your hourly surplus or deficit within 300 to 500 calories at all times, you'll best be able to change your body composition by losing fat and adding lean muscle mass. People with the largest energy imbalances (those whose calorie surpluses or shortfalls topped 500 calories from hour to hour) were the fattest, while those with the most balanced energy levels were the leanest. So if you eat only your three squares a day, your energy levels are all over the place. That kind of eating plan is great - if your dream is to consistently gain weight. But if you want to look slimmer, feel fitter, and live longer, then eat more often. Simply alternate your meals with snacks and you'll keep your stomach full, which will reduce the likelihood of a diet-destroying binge. <br /><br /><b>Guideline 2</b></p><p><b>Drink Smoothies Regularly </b><br /><br />A blender may be the ultimate weight-loss assistant. Smoothies - blended mixtures of milk, low-fat yogurt, whey protein powder, ice, and other good stuff - can act as meal substitutes and as potent snacks. They require little time; the berries, flavored whey powder (you won't even taste it), or peanut butter will satisfy your sweet cravings; and their thickness takes up space in your stomach. A University of Tennessee study found that people who added three servings of yogurt a day to their diets lost 61 percent more body fat and 81 percent more stomach fat over 12 weeks than people who didn't eat yogurt. Researchers speculate that the calcium helps the body burn fat and limits the amount of fat your body can make. So drink an 8-ounce smoothie for breakfast, as a meal substitute, or as a snack before or after your workout.<br /><br /><b>Guideline 3</b></p><p><b>Know What To Drink - and What Not To</b><br /><br />There are many ways that alcohol can get you into trouble. It doesn't make you feel full or decrease the amount of food you'll eat. But it does encourage your body to burn as much as 36 percent less fat and make you store more of the fat you eat. And it can inhibit your production of hormones that help burn fat and build muscle.<br /><br />Okay, so water isn't exciting, but drinking about 8 glasses of it a day has a lot of benefits. <br /><br />It helps keep you satiated (often what we interpret as hunger is really thirst). It flushes the waste products your body churns out when processing protein or breaking down fat. And it transports nutrients to your muscles to keep your metabolism clicking. Otherwise, the best drinks you can have are low-fat milk and green tea (or, if you must, no more than 2 glasses of diet soda a day).<br /><br /><b>Guideline 4</b></p><p><b>Focus on the Abs Diet Power 12</b><br /><br />The Abs Diet encourages you to focus on (not restrict yourself to) a generous market basket of food types - the Abs Diet <br /><br />Power 12 - to fulfill your core nutritional needs. These foods are so good for you, in fact, that they'll just about single-handedly exchange your fat for muscle (provided you've kept your receipt). Just as important, I've designed the Power 12 to include thousands of food combinations. The more of them you eat, the better your body will be able to increase lean muscle mass and avoid storing fat. Just follow these simple Guidelines:<br /><br /></p><li>Include two or three of these foods in each of your three major meals and at least one of them in each of your three snacks.<br /><br /></li><li>Diversify your food at every meal so that you can get a combination of protein, carbohydrates, and fat.<br /><br /></li><li>Make sure you sneak a little bit of protein into each snack.<br /><br /><b>Abs Diet Power 12</b><br /><br /><b>1. Almonds and Other Nuts</b> <br />(eat them with skins intact)<br /><br /><b>Superpowers:</b> Building muscle, fighting food cravings<br /><br /><b>Fight against:</b> Obesity, heart disease, muscle loss, cancer<br /><br />These days, you hear about good fats and bad fats the way you hear about good cops and bad cops. One's on your side, and one's going to beat you silly. Oreos fall into the latter category, but nuts are clearly out to help you. They contain the monounsaturated fats that clear your arteries and help you feel full. <br /><br />All nuts are high in protein and monounsaturated fat, but almonds are the best. Eat as much as 2 handfuls a day. If you eat 2 ounces of almonds (about 24 of them), it can suppress your appetite - especially if you wash them down with 8 ounces of water. <br /><br />For a quick popcorn alternative, spray a handful of almonds with nonstick cooking spray and bake them at 400°F for 5 to 10 minutes. Take them out of the oven and sprinkle them with either a brown sugar and cinnamon mix or cayenne pepper and thyme.<br /><br /><b>2. Beans and Other Legumes</b><br /> (including soybeans, chickpeas, pinto beans, navy beans, kidney beans, lima beans) <br /><br /><b>Superpowers:</b> Building muscle, helping to burn fat, regulating digestion<br /><br /><b>Fight against:</b> Obesity, colon cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure<br /><br />Beans are, as the famous rhyme says, good for your heart; the more you eat them, the more you'll be able to control your hunger. Black, lima, pinto, navy - you pick it. They're all low in fat, and they're packed with protein, fiber, and iron - nutrients crucial for building muscle and losing weight. <br /><br /><b>3. Spinach and Other Green Vegetables</b><br /><br /><b>Superpowers:</b> Neutralizing free radicals (molecules that accelerate the aging process)<br /><br /><b>Fight against:</b> Cancer, heart disease, stroke, obesity, osteoporosis<br /><br />You know vegetables are packed with important nutrients, but they're also a critical part of your body-changing diet. I like spinach in particular because one serving supplies nearly a full day's vitamin A and half of your vitamin C. It's also loaded with folate - a vitamin that protects against heart disease, stroke, and colon cancer. Dress a sandwich with the stuff, or stir-fry it with fresh garlic and olive oil. Or there's broccoli, high in fiber and more densely packed with vitamins and minerals than almost any other food. <br /><br />If you hate vegetables, hide them. Puree them and add them to marinara sauce or chili. The more you chop, the less you taste, and the easier it is for your body to absorb nutrients.<br /><br /><b>4. Dairy Products</b> <br />(nonfat or low-fat milk, yogurt, cheese, cottage cheese)<br /><br /><b>Superpowers:</b> Building strong bones, firing up weight loss<br /><br /><b>Fight against:</b> Osteoporosis, obesity, high blood pressure, cancer<br /><br />Dairy is nutrition's version of a typecast actor. It gets so much good press for strengthening bones that it garners little attention for all the other stuff it does well. Just take a look at the mounting evidence that calcium is a prime belly-buster. A University of Tennessee study found that dieters who consumed between 1,200 and 1,300 milligrams of calcium a day lost nearly twice as much weight as those taking in less calcium. Researchers think the mineral probably prevents weight gain by increasing the breakdown of body fat and hampering its formation. <br /><br />Low-fat yogurt, cheeses, and other dairy products can play a key role in your diet. But I recommend milk as your major source of calcium. Liquids take up lots of room in your stomach, so your brain gets the signal that you're full. Sprinkling in chocolate whey powder can help curb sweet cravings.<br /><br /><b>5. Instant Oatmeal</b> <br />(unsweetened, unflavored)<br /><br /><b>Superpowers:</b> Boosting energy, reducing cholesterol, maintaining blood-sugar levels<br /><br /><b>Fights against:</b> Heart disease, diabetes, colon cancer, obesity<br /><br />Oatmeal can propel you through sluggish mornings. You can also down a bowl a couple of hours before a workout to feel fully energized by the time you hit the gym or yoga mat, or at night to avoid a late-night binge. It couldn't be easier to prepare - just add water. Buy the unsweetened, unflavored variety and use other Powerfoods such as milk and berries to enhance the taste.<br /> <br />Oatmeal contains soluble fiber, meaning that it attracts fluid and stays in your stomach longer than insoluble fiber. It also works like a bouncer for your body, showing troublemakers the door. For example, soluble fiber helps remove LDL (bad) cholesterol from your circulatory system.<br /><br /><b>6. Eggs</b><br /><br /><b>Superpowers:</b> Building muscle, burning fat<br /><br /><b>Fight against:</b> Obesity<br /><br />For a long time, eggs were considered pure evil, and doctors were more likely to recommend tossing eggs at passing cars than throwing them into omelette pans. That's because just two eggs contain enough cholesterol to put you over your daily recommended value. Though you can cut out some of that by removing part of the yolk and using the white, more and more research shows that eating an egg or two a day will not raise your cholesterol levels. In fact, we've learned that most blood cholesterol is made by the body from dietary fat, not dietary cholesterol. That's why you should take advantage of eggs and their powerful makeup of protein.<br /><br /><b>7. Turkey and Other Lean Meats</b> <br />(lean steak, chicken, fish)<br /><br /><b>Superpowers:</b> Building muscle, improving the immune system<br /><br /><b>Fight against:</b> Obesity, mood disorders, memory loss, heart disease<br /><br />A classic lean muscle-building nutrient, protein is the base of any solid diet plan. Turkey breast is one of the leanest meats you'll find, and it packs nearly one-third of your daily requirements of niacin and vitamin B6. Beef, another classic lean muscle-building protein, is the top food source of creatine - a substance your body uses to make new muscle fibers. Look for round or loin cuts (code for extra-lean); New York strip is less fatty than prime rib. <br /><br />To cut down on saturated fats even more, concentrate on fish like tuna and salmon, because they contain a healthy dose of omega-3 fatty acids as well as protein. <br /><br /><b>8. Peanut Butter</b> <br />(all-natural, sugar-free)<br /><br /><b>Superpowers:</b> Boosting testosterone, building muscle, burning fat<br /><br /><b>Fights against:</b> Obesity, muscle loss, wrinkles, cardiovascular disease<br /><br />Yes, PB has its disadvantages: It's high in calories, and it isn't served in four-star restaurants. But it's packed with heart-healthy monounsaturated fats that can increase your body's production of testosterone, which can help muscles grow and fat melt. Three tablespoons a day should guarantee the benefit without overloading on the fat. <br /><br /><b>9. Olive Oil</b><br /><br /><b>Superpowers:</b> Lowering cholesterol, boosting the immune system<br /><br /><b>Fights against:</b> Obesity, cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure<br /><br />No need for a long explanation here: Olive oil and its brethren will help control your food cravings; they'll also help you burn fat and keep your cholesterol in check. Do you need any more reason to pass the bottle?<br /><br /><b>10. Whole-Grain Breads and Cereals</b><br /><br /><b>Superpowers:</b> Preventing your body from storing fat<br /><br /><b>Fight against:</b> Obesity, cancer, high blood pressure, heart disease<br /><br />There's only so long a person can survive on an all-protein diet or an all-salad diet or an all-anything diet. You crave carbohydrates because your body needs them. The key is to eat the ones that have all their heart-healthy, belly-melting fiber intact. Whole-grain carbohydrates can play an important role in a healthy lifestyle. Whole-grain bread keeps insulin levels low, which keeps you from storing fat. <br /><br /><b>11. Extra-Protein (Whey) Powder</b><br /><br /><b>Superpowers:</b> Building muscle, burning fat<br /><br /><b>Fights against:</b> Obesity<br /><br />Whey protein contains essential amino acids that build muscle and burn fat. But it's especially effective because it has the highest amount of protein for the fewest number of calories, making it fat's kryptonite. <br /><br /><b>12. Raspberries and Other Berries </b><br /><br /><b>Superpowers:</b> Protecting your heart, enhancing eyesight, improving memory, preventing cravings<br /><br /><b>Fight against:</b> Heart disease, cancer, obesity<br /><br />Depending on your taste, any berry will do (except Crunch Berries). I like raspberries, as much for their power as for their flavor. One cup packs 6 grams of fiber and more than half of your daily requirement of vitamin C.<br /><br />Blueberries are one of the most healthful foods you can eat. They beat out 39 other fruits and vegetables in the antioxidant-power ratings. And strawberries (along with grapefruit, peaches, apples, and oranges) contain another valuable form of fiber called pectin that can make you feel fuller for hours.<br /><br /><b>Guideline 5</b><p></p><p><b>Stop Counting</b><br /><br />Though calorie burning is paramount to losing fat, calorie counting will make you lose focus and motivation. The great news is that when you zero in on our Powerfoods, you'll be healthy and won't feel hungry as often. Plus, the most energy-efficient foods are almost like doormen: They're not going to let any of the riffraff in without your approval.<br /><br /><b>Guideline 6</b></p><p><b>For One Meal a Week, Forget the Guidelines</b><br /><br />I would never advocate cheating on your spouse or your taxes. But I want you to cheat on this diet. Take one meal during the week and forget everything about good carbohydrates and good fats. Have whatever it is - pizza, choc
late cake - that you miss the most. Think of this cheat meal as the carrot at the end of a good week of eating. Enjoy your meal of gluttony, but please, don't make the carrot literally a carrot.<br /><br /> <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/free-abs-diet-workout-and-meal-plan""></a></p><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/free-abs-diet-workout-and-meal-plan""><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/images/abs-diet-quickstart/abs-button-back.jpg"" /><br /><br /></a><br /><br /></li>",Eating Strategies

And if you've ever tried using math to manage the digits on your bathroom scale, you know that most diet equations don't add up. We wondered whether any of the roughly 338,000 Google hits for ""<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/set/?keycode=142686"">weight loss</a> formula"" can actually help you look good in that black latex cat suit this Halloween. Here's the lowdown on three basics:</p><p><b>Daily Caloric Requirement (DCR)</b></p><p><b>Translation</b> The math is pretty simple: Eat 500 fewer calories a day than your body requires and you'll drop a pound a week. But most online calculators (and even the pen-and-paper variety) are only 82 percent accurate (even less so if you're obese, sick, or an ethnic minority), according to the American Dietetic Association. And, says Mary Hartley, a registered nutritionist for about.com, the results can be flawed because the equation isn't tailored to the individual and because many people misjudge their fitness level. Plus, if you lose 10 pounds or more, you'll have to do the math again. </p><p><b>Salvation</b> Let sites like <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.caloriecount.about.com"">caloriecount.about.com</a>, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.mayoclinic.com"">mayoclinic.com</a>, or <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.mypyramid.gov"">mypyramid.gov</a> do the work for you. All factor in activity level and are backed by health pros.</p><p><b>Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) </b></p><p><b>Translation</b> While DCR calculates calorie input (how much you need to eat), the Resting Metabolic Rate tabulates calorie output (how much you burn doing absolutely nothing). Unfortunately, the ADA says the accuracy of these formulas is 45 to 80 percent (and again, they're less accurate if you're obese). </p><p><b>Salvation</b> Skip the formula and get tested by a pro; you can do this at many gyms (members pay about $50). You'll have to sit and breathe into a scubalike plastic tube while a computer records how much oxygen you inhale and how much carbon dioxide you exhale. After 12 minutes of fun, you get a printout showing you (with 95 percent accuracy) how much you burn at rest and how many cals you can consume and still ditch your saddlebags.</p><p><b>VO2 Max</b></p><p><b>Translation</b> This test, often used by athletes who train for grueling events, can also be useful for noncompetitors looking to lose weight, because the result helps pinpoint a target heart rate for fat burn. The formula is nearly 100 percent accurate, as long as you don't flub the test, which requires you to run or bike at top speed, typically for 12 to 14 minutes, while wearing a gas-mask-like apparatus that measures your oxygen intake. An ill-fitting mask (it should seal around your mouth) or not reaching your peak speed on the treadmill can skew the results.</p><p><b>Salvation</b> Search at vo2max testing.net for places that provide the test, which costs about $120. The test will tell you the amount of calories you burn in different heart-rate zones. Once you get your results, invest in a heart rate monitor--either one that straps around your chest (the most effective) or a watch (like the MioMotiva)--to keep tabs on your ticker as you work out within your ideal fat-blasting range.</p><p><b><i>Want to lose weight fast?

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/air-health,Health,61,55,48,18,0,1,4,0,,"Fresh Air, Bad Air: How to Tell the Difference",http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1103-fresh-air.jpg,"Right around the time when the days start getting longer and temps begin to rise, it's normal to want to ditch your spin class and liberate the road bike that's been sitting idle in your garage. What's not to love about filling your lungs with fresh spring air?<br /><br />Actually, there is something. If your favorite bike path winds along a busy thoroughfare, or the tennis court you frequent is located near a traffic-clogged intersection, you may be loading your lungs with harmful pollutants in the form of ozone (the main component of smog) and microscopic bits of soot, dust, aerosol, metal, free radicals, and other airborne contaminants. Not only does this toxic assault on your lungs compromise the effectiveness of your workouts, but it can also take a toll on your health.<br /><br /><b>Running on Fumes</b><br />First, some good news. The air we breathe has become a lot cleaner in the past 30 years. Since 1980, emissions of the six worst pollutants have dropped by nearly 50 percent, thanks to stricter laws regulating air quality. But here's the thing: People who exercise outdoors may still breathe in up to 10 times more airborne nastiness than those who spend less time being active outside. Whether your workout of choice is running, cycling, or taking boot-camp classes on the beach, doing any kind of vigorous outdoor exercise that causes you to breathe hard means you are gulping more air than if you were standing still, says Sam Callan, USA Cycling's sport science and coaching education manager. Even moderate <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/workouts"">workouts</a>, such as a brisk walk, can increase the amount of air you inhale. And along with all that extra muscle-fueling oxygen comes supersize portions of unhealthy pollution.<br /><br />What's worse, as you huff and puff through your mouth, some of that contamination whooshes deep into your lungs, bypassing your nasal passages, the body's natural air filter. The result? An irritated and inflamed trachea and lungs. You may wind up with symptoms such as a pesky cough, chest tightness, or a scratchy throat.<br /><br />Over time, regular exposure to pollution may trigger exercise-induced asthma (an attack of wheezing and airway constriction during a workout) and ups your risk for lung cancer by 20 percent, the same as a nonsmoker living with a smoker, says George D. Thurston, Sc.D., a professor of environmental medicine at New York University School of Medicine. Joggers who regularly run in high-ozone conditions may experience a thickening of the lining of their lungs (typically a smoker's affliction), which may prematurely age the lungs, although the exact health consequences are unknown, says Daniel Greenbaum, president of the Health Effects Institute, a Boston nonprofit organization that studies pollution's impact on health.<br /><br />Yet these effects often go unnoticed. In fact, the fitter you are, the less likely you are to see signs. ""Healthy people can be affected by air pollution without experiencing symptoms,"" says Norman Edelman, M.D., chief medical officer of the American Lung Association. So even if you feel fine, your lungs and workout still take a hit.<br /><br />In a 2008 study, cyclists pedaled in polluted conditions. Three days later, the distance they could ride decreased by 5 percent. And women, who have smaller airways, are more affected by the irritation and swelling that restricts oxygen intake than men are. A 2010 study of marathon runners published in <i>Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise</i> found that higher rates of pollution slowed women's race times, while men were unaffected.<br /><br /><br /><b>Your Body on Bad Air</b><br />Pollution affects more than just your airways, says former air pollution scientist Kenneth Rundell, Ph.D. When you inhale airborne contaminants, your body launches a defense against ""foreign invaders,"" which then causes inflammation. Over time, chronic inflammation can wreak havoc on every organ system. So it's not surprising that long-term exposure to bad air has been linked to a host of health problems-ironically the very conditions that regular exercise helps prevent-including high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, type 2 diabetes, decreased immune function, and certain cancers. One Canadian research team mapped levels of traffic-related air pollution in Montreal against breast-cancer diagnoses. They found that women living in locations with the worst air pollution were almost twice as likely to develop breast cancer as those in the cleanest areas, says Mark S. Goldberg, Ph.D., one of the researchers and a professor in the department of medicine at McGill University.<br /><br />If all this makes you want to strap on a gas mask every time you head outside, take comfort in this: Your lungs have several built-in cellular cleaning mechanisms that help neutralize irritants and rid the body of them, so you'll most likely recover pretty quickly from an occasional dose of dirty air.<br /><br />The bigger concern is what happens after years of repeated exposure. In fact, the Environmental Protection Agency likens breathing high levels of ozone to getting sunburned. Do it once or twice and you'll be OK; do it all the time and you could wind up with permanent damage.<br /><br />That's not to say you should retreat to the gym forever. ""No one in their right mind would say never exercise outdoors,"" says Greenbaum. ""There are so many physical and mental benefits."" Even small amounts of sunlight boost blood levels of vitamin D (a critical nutrient related to bone strength, immune function, and yes, lung health). Natural terrain challenges your muscles and balance better than any gym machine. And being outdoors is a proven mood booster. One study found that even recalling outdoor exercise can improve your outlook. You just need to be safe about exercising outside. ""Everyone should try to minimize their exposure as much as reasonably possible,"" says Edelman. Breathe easier with these strategies:<br /><br /><b>Get moving in the morning.</b> Ozone is generally lowest at this time, from roughly 6 a.m until 10 a.m., and it rises throughout the day as sunlight breaks down the hydrocarbons of auto exhaust, turning it into smog.<br /><br /><b>Replot your route.</b> Find ways around the busiest thoroughfares. A street with traffic that zooms past will be less polluted than a congested road that has cars idling at stoplights, their emissions hanging in the air. If you can't avoid high-traffic roadways, plan your workout so your hardest effort comes at the least congested part of your route. If you live in a city, hit the park.<br /><br /><b>Avoid the worst offenders.</b> Stay away from high-pollution scenarios altogether, such as parking lots and marinas with idling diesel vehicles (trucks, buses, boats) and areas where a forest fire is burning nearby. Yard equipment such as lawn mowers and snow or leaf blowers also spew fumes you don't want to inhale, so try not to be downwind of them, says Thurston.<br /><br /><b>Embrace the breeze.</b> ""The worst pollution days are usually the hot, stale days of summer,"" says Greenbaum. Windy conditions often make for better air days because the breeze disperses pollution, reducing its concentration.<br /><br /><b>Eat your antioxidants.</b> Getting the recommended daily dose (75 milligrams) of vitamin C, particularly through foods (e.g., broccoli, spinach, oranges, and tomatoes), may help your lungs resist pollution-related damage, says Thurston. Vitamin C reduces free radicals, lowers the production of inflammatory histamines, and helps boost glutathione, a detoxifying agent that aids cells in dealing with carcinogens and heavy metals such as lead and mercury.<br /><br /><b>Blow hard.</b> At your annual physical, ask your doctor to assess your lung function using spirometry, a test in which you'll blow into a measuring device. What to watch for: ""A trend over time indicating any adverse changes from your previous visit,"" says Thurston. Remember, exercise is still the best way to keep your lungs flexible and in top shape.<br /><br /><b>How Safe Is Your Air?</b><br />Three ways to check your air quality before heading outside<br /><br />Go to <a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.airnow.gov"">airnow.gov</a> and type in your location or zip code for a local color-coded air-quality index based on EPA calculations.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/get-good-luck,Life,77,54,25,4,0,7,0,0,,Be Happy: How to Make Your Own Luck,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1011-luck-art.jpg,"<p>We're taught to believe that some people are simply born lucky, when in reality, that's just a convenient excuse to lean back and take it easy, rather than try to exert some control over our destiny. After all, if you aren't one of the ""chosen"" fortunate ones, what can you possibly do about it?</p><p>Well, actually, quite a bit. The fact is, more and more psychologists are finding out that it isn't the hand you're dealt that's important in life but how you play your cards. To put it another way: We're all capable of making our own luck.</p><p>""What we think of as chance and luck are not at all the same thing,"" explains Richard Wiseman, Ph.D., a psychologist from the University of Hertfordshire and author of <i>The Luck Factor</i>, who has done a decade of research on the topic-enough to convince him that no more than 10 percent of life is actually random or pure chance.</p><p>""The rest is luck,"" he says. ""And luck is determined by your attitude toward life, by what you put out into the universe and how you respond to the results."" Carol Sansone, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the University of Utah, agrees: ""What appears to be luck is really the result of perceptions, personality traits, choices, and actions. And all of that is within your control."" Read on and discover how to put good luck firmly in your grasp.</p><p><b>Consider Yourself Lucky</b><br />Want to improve your luck? It could be as easy as adjusting your attitude. Studies show that people who consider themselves lucky actually tend to be-it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. That's because positive thinkers are always keeping their eyes peeled for fortuitous situations, and they're more likely to pounce on them when they arise.</p><p>In a study conducted by Wiseman, researchers placed some money on the sidewalk in the paths of different people-some who claimed to be lucky, and others who considered themselves unlucky. The ""lucky"" people noticed the money and picked it up; the ""unlucky"" people walked past the cash.</p><p>""Serendipitous types are upbeat and optimistic,"" says Sansone. ""They look for luck in all kinds of events, and they expect good outcomes."" It's a numbers game: If you believe you have a good shot at winning, you're more likely to participate in the football pool at work or the guess-how-many-jelly-beans-are-in-the-massive-freakin-jar contest at the mall. The more you take advantage of these chance opportunities, the more you improve your odds.</p><p><b>Lucky You:</b> ""As they say about the lottery, 'You have to play in order to win,' "" says Daniel ""Chip"" Denman, a statistician at the University of Maryland. If you don't take chances and put yourself in a position to have something positive happen, it won't. And pay close attention to what you're putting out there: ""The reactions you draw from others are a huge factor in determining your own luck,"" says Sonja Lyubomirsky, Ph.D., a psychologist at the University of California at Riverside. ""If you exude positive energy, people will respond to you positively.""</p><p><b>Shift Your Focus</b><br />Hey, there's certainly nothing wrong with being a conscientious worker and pouring your heart and soul into a worthwhile project. But by tuning out the rest of the world, you may be missing out on another way to reach your goal. People who are less flexible tend to overlook opportunities by staying too focused on only one path, according to Elizabeth Nutt Williams, Ph.D., a psychology professor at St. Mary's College of Maryland. ""That type of tunnel vision may lead to faster results,"" she says, ""but being willing to explore unforeseen opportunities can lead to different and unexpected outcomes, and sometimes better results in the long run.""</p><p><b>Lucky You:</b> Give it a rest, OK? Every once in a while, take a time-out from whatever project you've been slaving over. Not only will taking a breather clear your head and refresh your mind, but it may bring you in contact with something (or someone) that can help with whatever it is you're working on. Inspiration can come from pretty much anywhere: After-work margaritas with coworkers can lead to some helpful piece of office gossip or help you get a better understanding of what makes your boss tick. A few minutes of Web surfing might uncover a recent news story or study that supports a thesis you're writing.</p><p><b>Take More Risks</b><br />People who consider themselves lucky tend to take more chances, strike up more conversations with strangers, and follow more job leads. Instead of telling themselves, There's not a snowball's chance in hell that's going to happen, they tell themselves, That looks kind of cool. Maybe I should check it out. And they get stuff-good stuff, like a bump up to first class (simply because they asked for it), a cute boyfriend (who says you shouldn't make the first move?), or a cool job (they had the moxie to ask for a sit-down with the boss). And it gets better: Good outcomes increase the belief that you can accomplish whatever you set out to do, which fuels an appetite for future risk.</p><p><b>Lucky You:</b> You know the annoying little voice playing inside your head that's telling you not to do something? The one that sounds suspiciously like your hypercritical mother, your best frenemy, or your downer of a 10th-grade guidance counselor? Well, risk-taker types learn to tune out all the negativity. Follow their lead by listening to your gut and refusing to retreat (even if you have a few doubts). Instead, ask yourself this: What's the worse that can happen if I try this and fail? Chances are, it isn't all that bad. Then ask yourself, What will I regret more months or even years down the road: taking the risk or playing it safe? You already know the answer to that.</p><p><b>Brush Off Failure</b><br />Yes, failing sucks. But if you're going to let a critic's harsh words, a few (OK, numerous) impersonal rejection letters, or a job promotion that never materialized knock you out of the game-or make you reconsider your goal-you're making a serious mistake. An important trait among lucky people, according to Lyubomirsky, is that they don't get terribly fazed when something doesn't go according to plan, and they tend to move quickly to the next step. ""They have an adaptive way of dealing with failure,"" she explains. ""They don't dwell on the negative or let obstacles get in the way of taking another chance later."" Serendipitous types know that there are a lot of different paths for getting wherever it is they want to go. And even if their dream doesn't pan out, there's always another (usually better) opportunity just around the corner.</p><p><b>Lucky You:</b> Instead of sulking over a few nasty setbacks, use them to your advantage. Ask yourself, What have I learned from these experiences? What do I need to do next? Remember: Life's little roadblocks aren't the end, they're merely part of the journey as you make your way toward your ultimate goal. They're opportunities to tweak your talents and iron out the kinks so you can try again. And kick butt.</p><p><b>Break Familiar Patterns</b><br />Turns out, change really is good. Easygoing people who have more of a go-with-the-flow approach to life-and who are more willing to alter their daily or weekly routines-open themselves up to more opportunities and fortuitous encounters.</p><p><b>Lucky You:</b> Promise yourself that every couple of days, you'll break away from your usual patterns or, as Denman puts it, ""shuffle the deck of your daily activities."" Even a small adjustment-going out to lunch instead of brown-bagging it, taking an alternate route to work, trying a different fitness class-will double the number of people you come in contact with and increase the chances of something good happening. ""Taking a step out of the ordinary can be a great way to find good fortune,"" says Denman. But, he warns, you have to be mentally prepared to look for the good in any given situation. So keep your eyes peeled. You won't see potential opportunities if you're lost in your own little world.</p>",

Well, really they're on my gorgeous <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/the-average-woman-and-dating"">date</a>, Jason, but I'm getting his spillover gawks. It's hard not to look at Jason. He's the flesh-and-blood incarnation of Disney's Prince Charming. Blond flowing locks, piercing blue eyes, and a chiseled jaw that has the perfect five o'clock shadow, even at 11 p.m. </p><p>""Jason!"" yells a stunner, who scurries over to greet him.</p><p>""Hey, Maria! How are you?"" He kisses her cheek.</p><p>They ignore me while they catch up, and I'm visibly annoyed. I grab some foie gras from a server's tray--­appropriate fare, since I feel like chopped liver.</p><p>""Maria, this is Laura,"" Jason finally acknowledges. Then to me, whispers, ""Can I tell her what we're doing?""</p><p>The jig is up. Jason admits to Maria that I'm a writer who hired him through his modeling agency for a story about what it's like to date a drop-dead gorgeous guy. I've been looking for <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/monogamy"">Mr. Right </a>ever since boys went from having cooties to being cuties. Now Dream Man has been thrown into my lap, and it's up to me to decide for all womankind whether the experience lives up to the hype.</p><p>Dating Jason is like riding a <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/relationship-advice-2"">self-esteem</a> roller coaster. When we walk into a room, the jealous stares of women everywhere make me feel like I'm as gorgeous as he is, perhaps through the power of beauty osmosis. But it doesn't take long for that feeling to turn to paranoia. Suddenly I'm self-conscious about my outfit, scent, and every body part from the ankles up. Now I see their envious eyes as signs of skepticism. ""She must have a terrific personality,"" they must be thinking. Even my parents are incredulous. After showing them photos of me and Jason, my mom says, ""Are you sure he's not gay? He's so pretty!"" while my dad gives me a stern he's-going-to-break-your-heart look. My friends' reactions range from fear (best pal: ""I didn't want to look at him because I was scared I would flirt"") to backhanded flattery (former roommate: ""Your ex-boyfriends were so basic. It's about time you upgraded"").</p><p>True, I've never dated a guy of Jason's physical caliber, and I find myself being more forgiving because of it. When he cancels our first date at the last minute, I brush it off. When he spends too much time texting during one of our dates, I shrug. I wouldn't normally be so lenient, so it makes me wonder if there's a correlation between a man's attractiveness and a woman's pushoverability.</p><p>Jason's looks also blind me from, well, him. I know the basics (he's 27, from Philly, loves hockey), but our conversations are mostly superficial. Maybe it's not him; maybe it's my stupid insecurity getting in the way of having a good time. He smiles at me, but how do I know he's not silently mocking my asymmetrical nostrils? </p><p>My thoughts, I discover, may be keeping us from connecting on a deeper level. I want to make out with him, but I'm not sure a relationship would work. He might have some of the qualities I look for in a mate--a sense of humor, the ability to put an Ikea armoire together with his bare hands--but real chemistry requires more. I also want to be with someone who makes me feel comfortable in my own skin. Someone who doesn't make me want to jab myself with a Botox needle when I run my hands across his smooth complexion.</p><p>Research shows we prefer partners with a similar level of attractiveness because, evolutionarily, we want to conserve our genes by mating with those who have similar DNA. (That would explain Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.) I may not be a troll, but I'm certainly not in Jason's league. And maybe I don't need to be. I don't want perfection. I prefer a man with flaws: scars, wrinkles, a pudgy belly. That said, I'd probably be open to another ""test drive."" </p><p>Tom Brady, you've been warned.</p><p><b>How to do it yourself </b><br /><i>By Sarah Stebbins</i></p><p>So the hot guy asking for your digits wasn't looking past you, and at the skinny blonde beyond!

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/positive-change,Life,64,53,27,1,0,0,0,0,,"Slim Body, Fat Wallet",http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1005-slim-body-art.jpg,"<p>When it comes right down to it, we all know what we have to do to lose weight: Eat less, exercise more. And we also know what we have to do to get ourselves out of debt: Spend less, save more. The secret sauce that's the key to making these and other important life changes isn't really a secret at all. So why is it that we have so much trouble actually doing these seemingly simple things?</p><p>Because changing how we behave, particularly if we've been acting that way for many years, isn't easy. Our habits are often so ingrained that we don't even think about them on a day-to-day basis-until the number on the scale or the balance on our credit-card statement forces us to face the unsettling truth.</p><p>Here's the part where I tell you how to turn an unhappy situation around. Experts say that strengthening one area of your life (your finances, for example) can give you the confidence and fire you need to improve another part (like your waistline).</p><p>""When you get your act together in one way,"" says Michelle vanDellen, Ph.D., visiting professor of psychology at the University of Georgia, ""you practice the behaviors necessary to pull your act together in others."" You get better at resisting temptation, whatever it is-whether it's reaching for a double-fudge brownie or buying a pair of $600 heels-and the ability to resist becomes more habitual.</p><p><strong>Get Ready</strong><br />James Prochaska, Ph.D., director of the Cancer Prevention Research Center at the University of Rhode Island-and one of the country's leading experts in the field of behavioral change- has helped tens of thousands of people quit smoking, reduce their stress, and lose excess weight by prepping them for the change. His fundamental belief is that the big reason so many people relapse on their New Year's resolutions by (you guessed it!) February, is that they didn't do enough to prepare themselves to take on those shifts. ""Change is a process,"" he says, ""not an event. And 80 percent of people aren't prepared when they start.""</p><p>So how do you lay the groundwork? Getting ready involves moving consciously through several stages. In what Prochaska calls the ""precontemplation"" stage, change is just nibbling at your mind, and your job is to raise your awareness of the benefits of changing. That might mean thinking about the cool vacation you could save for when you no longer have those big credit-card bills to contend with, or the thrill of fitting back into your favorite skinny jeans.</p><p>Then comes the next stage, ""contemplation,"" when you are seriously thinking about making a change. When you're at this stage, it helps to focus on how the pros of taking some kind of action outweigh the cons. Sure, you might miss your morning full-fat latte and your Friday-night pizza outings, but seeing the pounds melt off is so much more gratifying. ""People who can't see a good balance of pros over cons are likely to give up and say it's not worth it,"" Prochaska points out. When you can list twice as many pros as cons, you're good to go! (See ""Should You Go On a Debt Diet?"" above, to find out about my collaboration with Prochaska. After he read my book Pay It Down! we decided to work together on a program that would not only show people what they needed to do to reduce their debt but also help them make the changes necessary in order to succeed.)</p><p><strong>Don't Try Too Much Too Soon</strong><br />Unless you know that you're, say, aiming to drop a total of 15 pounds or pay back $3,000 on your credit cards, you won't be able to gauge the success of your changes. But once you have those big goals, it's key to break them into smaller ones that you can hit more frequently. If you see constant progress, you'll be less likely to feel frustrated and quit.</p><p>A recent study showed that people who aimed to save a lot of money (and set goals that were a stretch) actually saved less over time than those who aimed to save smaller, more manageable amounts. So those 15 pounds will roll off more easily if you're aiming for two pounds a week for two months. And that $3,000 in debt will disappear more quickly if you work toward coming up with $300 a month for 10 months</p><p><strong>Pick the Right Friends...</strong><br />A series of five studies conducted by vanDellen at Duke University showed that self-control is contagious. In one cool experiment, vanDellen notes, 36 subjects in a laboratory setting watched someone make a choice between carrot sticks and freshly baked chocolate-chip cookies. Later, the study subjects were given tests known to measure self-control (like holding a hand-grip for as long as you can). Those who had witnessed the person eating the carrots scored better on the tests.</p><p>What's the takeaway? ""You can improve your own self-control by being strategic with your social networks,"" she says. Hang out with people who see shopping as their higher calling and you'll probably end up spending more than you wanted to; dine with friends who think nothing of ordering decadent desserts, and you'll find it harder to stick to the lemon sorbet</p><p><strong>...And the Right Places</strong><br />It also helps to put yourself in a physical environment where you are more able to succeed. For example, if you walk past a trendy boutique every day on your way home from work-and every day you're tempted to go in and spend money on the great stuff in the window-change your route.</p><p>The flip side of this: It can help just to imagine places that inspire self-control, vanDellen notes. ""Research shows that students who simply think about the library have better self-control over all aspects of life,"" she says. ""So do people who think about the gym. Consider the places you associate with self-control.""</p><p><strong>Reward Yourself</strong><br />One of the big stumbling blocks in making the sort of changes involved in shedding debt or losing weight is delayed gratification. Neuroscientists who use MRIs to look at our brains have seen why we're hardwired to have trouble with this: When something we'd like to buy now comes into view, the pleasure centers in our brains go berserk. But when we're asked to think about buying something in the future- or consider a far-off financial goal like retirement-our pleasure centers don't respond with those fireworks.</p><p>To overcome these mental obstacles, give yourself frequent rewards that don't knock you off the path to your goal, says Kevin Volpp, director of the Center for Health Incentives at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and the Wharton School. He has designed programs that, for example, tripled the rate of smoking cessation at a corporation by building in $750 financial rewards along the way for quitters. When you're working toward a weight-loss goal, consider trying this yourself: Ask a friend to monitor your progress, and give yourself $50 (or less) to spend on something for yourself for every week you stay on target. If you're shedding debt, an inexpensive weekly treat like getting a manicure is something you can look forward to.</p><p><strong>Finally, Give Yourself Some Slack</strong><br />Remember: Change is a process, not an event, as Prochaska says. It takes time, and you're likely to hit the occasional setback or bad day. When (not if, but when) that happens, take a deep breath and remember that these are changes you want to make for the long-term. If on a particular day you find you don't have enough willpower to attack both challenges, look at it as a sort of muscle fatigue and ease up. Count calories today. Stick to your budget tomorrow. And over time, you'll build up enough strength to reach both goals.</p>",

Complete each move, resting for 10 to 15 seconds before doing the next exercise. At the end, rest for three minutes, then repeat the circuit two more times. After two weeks, rest for two minutes at the end of each circuit. Also aim to decrease your rest between moves, says Dowdell. So if you take 15 seconds in week one, aim for 10 seconds in week two.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/man-down,Life,59,52,54,10,0,0,4,0,,Man Down: Why Women Rule,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1104-women-on-top.jpg,"<p>Early on, I developed a thesis consistent with a sentiment I have long believed to be true: Women, as a group, are more deliberate, compassionate, and thoughtful than men. Since then, I've found evidence that women are also the superior gender in other, less obvious areas. For example, data suggests that women are more effective gamblers, savvier spies, and more successful hedge-fund managers. Simply put: Mano a womano, the womanos come out on top.</p><p>Behind every great man is a great woman? A truer truism would be that behind every great man is probably an even greater woman-and in most cases, she ought to be out in front. Here are just three of the many areas of <a target=""_blank"">female domination</a>:</p><p><b>Women Are Better Doctors</b><br />Need a good physician? In addition to seeing which hospitals an M.D. may be affiliated with, or asking your friends for suggestions, there's another factor to consider: gender. In 2009, the British government reported the results of its largest study of medical performance, a database of info on doctors and dentists investigated for medical misconduct or incompetence over a period of eight years. In that time, just 20 percent of the doctors referred for a more thorough investigation were women. How many of the doctors in England were women at the time? Double that number. When it came to the worst offenders-those barred from resuming work-the numbers were even worse for guys. Among general practitioners, 200 men got the boot, compared with just 29 women.</p><p>In the United States, the numbers appear to be equally lopsided. A 2010 report from the American Medical Association found that male physicians were twice as likely to be sued as <a target=""_blank"">female doctors</a>. There are a host of possible explanations, including riskier specialties that include more male doctors, but maybe as a group, female doctors are more careful. Pauline W. Chen, M.D., wrote in The New York Times: ""Several studies have shown that female doctors tend to be more encouraging and reassuring, use shared decision making, ask more psychosocial questions, and spend more time...with patients than male doctors do.""</p><p><b>Women Have Better Muscular Endurance</b><br />Women aren't universally faster or stronger than men are, but that doesn't mean they can't be better at certain athletic endeavors-in particular, endurance sports such as long-distance running. A 2000 University of Colorado study showed that, in certain stamina-related exercises, women's endurance was almost twice that of men in the purest terms: exertion over time. Solely in terms of time, the numbers are more impressive: Women were able to exercise for about 75 percent longer than men could.</p><p>Why the advantage? It may be hormone related. In 2003, The Boston Globe reported, ""Estrogen...offers women an edge in endurance. Research suggests [it] has a protective effect on muscles, making women less prone to soreness. It may also delay fatigue.""</p><p>With regard to long-distance running, the differences may also stem from the same trait that makes women better investors: They think long term. ""Women tend to pace themselves better,"" noted a 2010 Chicago Tribune article. ""Studies show men, perhaps fueled by testosterone, go out too hard, too soon, and end up bonking more often than women.""</p><p>There may also be a simpler explanation: Women tend to have higher percentages of body fat, and layers of fat help regulate body temperature. Couple this with the fact that estrogen seems to protect muscles, and it's clear how the whole package is better equipped for a long trek.</p><p><b>Women Are Better Investors</b><br />A 2010 report from <i>The Hedge Fund Journal </i>revealed that out of the $1.5 trillion invested in hedge funds around the world, only 3 percent of that money is managed by women. That's a shame, because the average levelheaded woman may be able to blow away the profits of most of the boys.</p><p>In 2010, <i>The New York Times</i> reported that women were making more money in the stock market than men were. Male investors, as a group, appear to be overconfident, said the head of the mutual-fund company Vanguard, leading them to buy or sell stocks without all the necessary information, while women are more likely to wait until they know more.</p><p>In fact, the results are so pronounced that there is a new trend to bring out the girlie side of men working on Wall Street. A <i>New York</i> magazine story detailed how investment coaches are trying to get stockbrokers in touch with their ""feminine side"" by doing things like writing their feelings in diaries. In one case, a boss allegedly forced a trader to take female hormones. Shockingly, none of these tricks seem to work as well as just getting a woman to do this typically masculine job.<br /></p>",What To Wear

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/types-of-birth-control-0,Health,34,51,5,3,2,0,0,0,,Birth Control Options: IUD ,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/iuds.jpg,"<p><strong>What it is:</strong> <br /> An intrauterine device (IUD) is a T-shaped pliable plastic rod with an attached thread that measures just over an inch long and is inserted into the uterus through the cervix. There are three kinds on the market: One type is hormonal and lasts up to five years; the second type delivers a lower dose of hormones and lasts up to the three years; and the other uses copper and lasts up to 10 years.</p><p><strong>What it does:</strong><br />While non-hormonal IUDs are made from copper, which acts as a natural spermicide, hormonal IUDs gradually release small doses of the synthetic hormone levonorgestrel-the same stuff in emergency contraceptive pills. Both options thicken your cervical mucus, which creates a hostile environment for embryo implantation and prevents pregnancy, says Laura Corio, M.D., a Manhattan-based gynecologist</p><p><strong>There are two main types of IUDs:</strong> </p><p><strong>Progestin-releasing IUD (Mirena, Skyla):</strong>Like other progesterone-based forms of contraception, this device causes the cervical mucus to thicken, which keeps sperm from reaching an egg. The hormone also thins the uterine lining, preventing an egg that does get fertilized from implanting. The Mirena lasts up to five years. Skyla, which was approved by the FDA in 2013, delivers a lower dose of hormones, is slightly smaller, and last up to three years. </p><p><strong>Copper-coil IUD (ParaGard, made by Barr Pharmaceuticals): </strong> This IUD slowly releases copper ions for up to 10 years. Copper inhibits sperm and the egg's ability to implant in the uterine wall.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong><br />Although just 2 percent of American women use IUDs, of those who do, 99 percent report being satisfied. Once the device is inserted, nothing has to be done except a monthly self-check to make sure the string is still in place.</p><p>Plus, the IUDs currently on the market are more than 99 percent effective at preventing pregnancy. A recent study also found that IUDs are <a href=""http://blog.womenshealthmag.com/scoop/iud-safety/"">safe and effective for women of all ages-including teens</a>. Finally, you can remove it whenever you want by visiting your doctor's office. </p><p><strong>Which is better?</strong><br />It depends. If you crave a lighter, and possibly nonexistent, period, Mirena may be the way to go. Because it thins the uterine lining, there's less blood, says Ross Marchetta, M.D., an ob-gyn in Akron, Ohio. (Skyla hasn't been on the market long enough to know for sure how it affects menstruation, but the benefits should be similar to Mirena.) By contrast, the copper ParaGard can make bleeding and cramps worse by irritating the uterine lining, so ParaGard might not be for you if you already have severe cramps. However, if you want to avoid pumping artificial hormones into your body, ParaGard is a more appealing option.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <br /> The main downside of IUDs is infection. While the risk is low, the devices can make existing ones-specifically, chlamydia and gonorrhea-much worse. About one in 100 women report infections in the first 20 days after getting an IUD, usually because bacteria have crept in during insertion. Those infections can generally be treated with antibiotics. So finding a skilled doctor to perform the procedure is crucial. While all gynos are trained to do it, it's a good idea to ask how often she inserts IUDs. Two or more a week is reassuring. </p><p>While it's very rare, women who've never been pregnant could possibly expel the IUD. Reason: Before pregnancy, your uterus and cervix are smaller and less pliable, so your body might resist having a piece of plastic resting there. However, only about 2 percent of women have this problem, and newer versions like Skyla are specifically designed to fit the less flexible uterus of a woman who hasn't given birth.</p><p>The most common side effects associated with using the ParaGard IUD are cramping and heavy bleeding in some women. Women using the Mirena IUD may initially have irregular periods and bleeding. After a few months, you may experience lighter periods or no periods at all.</p><p>So why do IUDs have such a sketchy reputation? You can blame it on an old version called the Dalkon Shield, an IUD popular in the 1970s. It was pulled from the market in 1974 because it played a role in thousands of infections, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and sepsis. The conditions caused infertility in some women and have been linked to at least 17 deaths. But in 1974, the pocket calculator was considered high-tech-so comparing the old IUD with today's versions is like pitting Pong against Halo.</p><p><strong>Protects against STDs?</strong><br />No</p><p><strong>Prescription needed?</strong><br /> Yes</p>","birth control,birth control options"

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/why-norwegians-are-thin,Health,49,49,29,4,0,9,0,0,,Healthy Habits in Norway,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0906-model-blonde.jpg,"<p>Growing up in Oslo, Norway, Anne Karen Jenum led a modest life. Though her family was far from poor, they ate simply. Dinner was vegetable soup and a bit of fresh fish. For dessert, her mother sometimes made compote from apricots or doled out wild berries that the children had picked themselves. ""My sister and I might have had a <a href=""/health/daily-dose-july-20-easy-weight-loss"">soft drink</a> on a special occasion,"" recalls Anne Karen, ""but it was just a little one- maybe three ounces. And we shared it."" </p><p>Anne Karen's family did not own a car, so she walked to school and back home-a distance of four miles each way. When it was snowing, she used a sled. And although her father occasionally provided money for the commuter train, she and her sister got around in the summers by bike. </p><p>Anne Karen's Norwegian healthy lifestyle was typical, and its long-term health effects are striking. According to data gathered by the World Health Organization, in 2007 just 5.8 percent of Norwegian women were significantly <a href=""/weight-loss/americas-weight-problem"">overweight</a>-making Norway's people among the slimmest in the developed world. Tor Claudi, project director in the Norwegian Directory for Health Affairs, believes that the country's location and comparatively slow economic development sheltered it from changes in the availability of food, attitudes about transportation technology, and the subsequent decline in daily exercise that transformed life in the United States and Europe in the second half of the 20th century. Until recently, fast food wasn't available, so the traditional Norwegian <a target=""_self"" href=""/fitness/abs-diet-quickstart-meal-plan"">diet</a> consisted of fish, meat, potatoes, and vegetables. Even now, he notes, dining out is relatively uncommon. </p><p>Another difference: The <a href=""/weight-loss/100-calorie-snacks"">portion sizes</a> at restaurants are smaller than those typically found in the States. Cathrine Halverson, a 26-year-old insurance advisor who works in Oslo, spent the past year living with her boyfriend in Kansas. She was astounded by the meals served in American restaurants. ""The first time we went out to eat, I asked, 'Is this a plate for two?'"" she recalls. ""They said, 'No, just for one.' I thought, oh my God-in Norway it would be for three!"" </p><p>Norwegians have been equally slow to adopt Americans' more <a href=""/health/sedentary-lifestyle-hazards"">sedentary lifestyle</a>, brought about by cars, freeways, and suburban sprawl. While the number of automobiles in the country has grown by 30 percent since 1985, many people still walk or bike to work. Gro Holstad, 46, the vice general secretary of the Norwegian Diabetes Foundation, also spent a year in the U. S. and was baffled by its car culture. ""I'm used to walking or jogging to get where I'm going,"" she says. ""When I did that in America, drivers would lean out the window to ask, 'Why are you walking? Can I drive you anyplace?'"" Gro grew up hiking and skiing, and her teenage children adhere to that tradition. ""We're proud of our outdoor culture,"" she says. ""I've got it in my blood to be active, and they've got it, too."" </p><p>When you compare rates of type 2 diabetes-one of the diseases most closely associated with being overweight-in Norway against those in the U. S., the differences are just as startling. In the past two years alone, the number of Americans with the disease has increased by almost 15 percent, to 23.6 million people, 7.8 percent of the population. Norway, by contrast, has one of the lowest rates of any Western nation-3.6 percent. Five years ago, a survey found only 15 cases of underage type 2 diabetes in all of Norway-and all but one of those were in immigrants. </p><p>But despite the country's low rates of obesity and diabetes, there are small but unmistakable signs that Norway's traditionally healthy lifestyle may be in jeopardy. Knut Dahl-Jorgensen, M.D., D.M.Sc., a researcher who studies diabetes and weight at the University of Oslo, says that many Norwegians used to spend their summers boating or hiking and their winters skiing. But the tradition of activity has waned a bit with changes in lifestyle. Now people work longer hours to compete in the global marketplace, and they spend more of their leisure time at the computer or in front of a TV. So far, the shift has been gradual, but experts worry it's a harbinger of worse to come. </p><p>Norway's modern story is familiar. The country's economy boomed in the 1970s and '80s, and-mimicking what happened in the U. S. after World War II-families began moving into the suburbs. That migration brought tighter schedules and longer commutes, usually by car. Other habits also changed. With extra money to spend on food, Norwegians enjoyed more imported goods-produce like citrus was exotic next to the staples of cabbage, carrots, onions, and cauliflower. But soon, soft drinks and fast food started to edge out the traditional diet of fish and homemade bread. Anne Karen says that her two eldest daughters, who are in their early thirties, eat well, but that her youngest, 19, has to be prompted to get outside and eats candy frequently. ""We're hoping she'll grow out of it,"" she says wearily. </p><p>It's this anecdotal evidence about Norway's adolescents that troubles epidemiologist Haakon Meyer, M.D., Ph.D., of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and the University of Oslo. ""It doesn't take much to shift the population's weight as a whole,"" he says. Because lifestyle changes are gradual, a country's increasing collective waistline can go unnoticed for years- especially since health problems associated with obesity can take time to manifest. </p><p>Dahl-Jorgensen points out that the weight and health crisis in the U. S. had been brewing for several decades before type 2 diabetes became an epidemic. American researchers began noticing signs in the late 1980s, when the first cases in children under 12 turned up. By the mid-1990s, one in five children were overweight- twice as many as in 1970-and the current figure is closer to 30 percent. </p><p>Though Norway remains slimmer than many other developed countries, the most recent data show that its obesity rate has more than doubled in the past 10 years, alarming officials who fear that the country is headed for an Americansized epidemic of <a target=""_self"" href=""/weight-loss/weight-loss-secrets"">weight-related health problems</a>. Public-health officials tend to place Norway roughly 20 years behind the U. S. on the obesity curve; the question that obsesses doctors and politicians in Norway is whether an American-style health crisis can be averted, and the question of how to keep the country thin has become a matter of public debate. Last year, the U. S. spent $174 billion-10 percent of its health-care expenditures-on diabetes-related illnesses, and fear that Norway could one day face a comparable bill has prompted a wide range of interventions there. The government recently began mulling a ""fat tax"" on <a target=""_self"" href=""/nutrition/sugar-content-in-food"">sugar and junk food</a> (it already taxes soft drinks), hoping that higher prices might discourage mindless snacking. And the CEO of one of the country's largest supermarket chains has removed the value-added tax from the price of vegetables and fruits in his stores in a voluntary effort to steer people toward more healthy eating. </p><p>Still, Norway's war against obesity has been slow to gain momentum. Within the government, the proposed fat tax has generated debate over whether it's an appropriate measure for a thickening population or if it would turn Norway into a nanny state that regards its citizens as incapable of making intelligent health decisions on their own. Another bill that mandates fresh fruit and vegetables in schools has come under attack for diverting money that could be spent on science labs and music programs. </p><p>Likewise, while many Norwegians support school programs to teach children nutrition and promote healthy behavior, the impact modern life has had on the country's youth is hard to dismiss. Compared with the myriad candy bars and supersize soft drinks available, the fruit compote and three-ounce soda of Anne Karen Jenum's childhood are a hard sell. ""Nowadays, kids in Norway are surrounded by temptation,"" Meyer says. </p><p>Still, if any country stands a chance of avoiding America's fate, it's Norway. Interventions have begun well before obesity becomes widespread-a step that endocrinologist Larry C. Deeb, M. D., past president of the American Diabetes Association and a consultant to the International Diabetes Federation, says could be crucial to keeping the population slim. So far, roughly 360,000 Norwegian workers-almost 10 percent of the country's population-have enrolled in a program overseen by the newly established Company Sport Association, which creates individually tailored workout plans for corporate employees (Microsoft Norway is a client). And the culture of outdoor recreation has not vanished. Municipal authorities in Oslo recently purchased 3,000 bicycles for public use, only to be swamped by a demand for more. The capital city is also surrounded by forests accessible to hikers and cyclists, and whereas American cities are built for cars, Oslo's streets remain heavily pedestrian. </p><p>The country hopes to keep it that way. Preserving the traditional walk to school, Anne Karen says, ""has been part of Oslo's planning policy for decades."" In her district, close to the forest on the north side of the city, parents are explicitly asked not to drive their children to school in order to promote an active lifestyle. (Typically, one parent escorts a group of the youngest children to school each morning.) And in order to keep walking routes safe, legislation has been passed to minimize traffic, even in the city center. </p><p>Norwegian families also put an emphasis on family meals, Claudi says. (Americans spend 174 times as much money as Norwegians on fast food each year.) ""Cooking and eating together forces you to slow down and think about what you're putting into your body,"" says Peter Fraenkel, Ph.D., director of the Center for Work and Family at the Ackerman Institute for the Family in New York City. And eating more slowly has another benefit: It doesn't trigger the pancreas to pump out extra insulin (which could encourage diabetes) the way speed-feeding does. </p><p>The notion of strolling school kids and <i>Leave It to Beaver</i>-style dinners is unlikely to catch on widely in the States. But one thing the U.S. could learn from Norway is its emphasis on early intervention. Because adult habits are harder to change, the country is focusing the bulk of its efforts on the young, requiring nutrition classes at two different grade levels, extending mandatory exercise programs, and providing students with water rather than soda, says Ellen Pedersen, the State Secretary of Norway. In the U. S., meanwhile, school health-education programs are haphazard and soda machines are still permitted on many campuses, even as experts here have long said that programs similar to those in Norway are needed to help curtail childhood obesity and diabetes. </p><p>So what has motivated the Nordic nation to successfully implement such large-scale reforms? It's simple, Pedersen says: ""We fear becoming like you.""<br /></p>",

That said, it's always wise-and especially in the beginning of the plan, when you're most vulnerable and adjusting to a new way of eating-to focus on portion control by limiting the servings of some foods, especially the ones with fat (like peanut butter) and carbohydrates (like rice or bread).</p><p>We'll always prescribe healthy portions in your meal plan, but if you're eating out, or find yourself in a buffet line, keep this rule in mind: Stick to one to two servings per food group and keep the total contents of each meal contained to the diameter of your plate. A height restriction is in effect. </p><p><b>Know What to Drink-And What Not To</b><br />We drink beer. We drink wine. We like to drink beer and wine, gin and tonics on a hot summer day, and a lot of other things. There are health benefits to having one or two drinks a day, but there are many ways that alcohol can get you into trouble.</p><p>Most important, alcohol-just like soda-adds calories that you don't need right now. These calories are empty calories because they don't actually help make you full or decrease the amount of food you'll eat.</p> <p>In fact, alcohol makes you eat more and encourages your body to burn less fat. When Swiss researchers gave eight healthy people enough alcohol to exceed their daily calorie requirements by 25 percent (five beers for someone who eats 3,000 calories a day), they found that booze actually impaired their ability to burn fat by as much as 36 percent.</p> <p>Booze also makes you store fat. Your body sees alcohol as a poison and tries to get rid of it. So your liver stops processing all other calories until it has dealt with the alcohol. Anything else you eat while you're drinking most likely will end up as fat. In some more indirect ways, alcohol can inhibit your body's production of hormones that help burn fat and build muscle. </p> <p><b>Don't Skimp on the Best Liquid Asset</b><br />We hate to tell you to drink water, but drinking about eight glasses a day has a lot of benefits. It helps keep you satiated. (A lot of times what we all interpret as hunger is really thirst.) Water flushes the waste products your body makes when it breaks down fat for energy or when it processes protein.</p> <p>You also need water to transport nutrients to your muscles, help digest food, and keep your metabolism clicking. If you're serious about shedding belly flab, stay away from alcohol for the 6-week <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/free-abs-diet-workout-and-meal-plan"">Abs Diet Quickstart</a> plan. At the least, limit yourself to two or three alcoholic drinks per week. The best drinks you can have are fat-free, 1 percent, or 2 percent milk; water; and green tea (or, if you must, two glasses of diet soda a day).</p> ",

We started with a list of the 20 most popular types of seafood in the U.S. (which explains why hairy anchovies are missing). Using the latest FDA data and a serving size of 3 ounces, we calculated the omega-3 (DHA and EPA) content of each fish, plus other nutritional perks like selenium, a mineral that bolsters cancer-fighting antioxidants, and B12 vitamins, which are crucial to nerve health. Then we factored in average levels of toxins like mercury and PCBs. The result: a safe seafood and fish list that will let you navigate the fish counter like Captain Ahab.<br /><br /><br /><b>1. Salmon</b> (the wild kind) wins by a waterslide, and is a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/mercury-from-fish"">healthy fish</a> you can count on to pack in nutrition. Most varieties, including coho and sockeye, provide more than three times the 250-mg recommended minimum daily dose of omega-3s. Wild Atlantic salmon is king of the sea with a mighty 1.6 g of the good stuff and a mini mercury count of 0.01 ppm. A serving also gets you 72 percent of your 55-mcg RDA of selenium. <b>Avoid</b> Farmed salmon, which may contain PCBs from polluted water.<br /><br /><b>2. Rainbow trout </b> (the farmed kind) gets the silver medal for a full gram of omega-3s. Tests on mixed varieties of trout show only 0.07 ppm of mercury, and farmed may contain even less. It also boasts more than twice the 2-mcg RDA for B12 and half the 15-mg RDA for niacin, which lowers bad cholesterol and plays a key role in metabolism. <br /><br /><b>3. Oysters</b> (from the Pacific) are almost devoid of mercury (0.01 ppm) and pack 1.2 g of omega-3s per 3 oz. Each slippery serving also delivers more than twice the 12-mg RDA of immunity- and libido-boosting zinc. <b>Avoid</b> Wild Eastern and American oysters - they may contain PCBs.<br /><br /><b>4. Striped bass </b>(if farmed) is not known to contain mercury in any measurable quantity, and packs 0.8 g of omega-3s, more than twice the suggested minimum. Bonus nutrients include about double the RDA of B12 and 72 percent of your daily selenium. <b>Avoid</b> Mercury-laden wild striped bass (0.22 ppm).<br /><br /><b>5. Pollock</b> (from the Atlantic) - often used to make filet-o-fish, fish sticks, and imitation crab (aka surimi) - is rich in B12 (3 mcg) and selenium (40 mcg) and extremely low in mercury (0.04 ppm). And its 0.5 g of omega-3s is nothing to shake a fin at. <b>Avoid</b> Pacific pollock - it's more likely to contain PCBs.<br /><br /><b>6. Flounder and sole</b> are nutritional twins and contain a healthy 0.4 g of omega-3s and just 0.04 ppm of mercury. A single serving has nearly 100 percent of your daily RDA of selenium and B12. <b>Avoid</b> Blackback and Summer varieties - they can pack PCBs.<br /><br /><b>7. Alaskan king crab</b> deserves its crown as the crustacean with the biggest omega-3 bang (0.4 g) and a piddly 0.06 ppm of mercury. It's low cal (82 calories per 3 oz), and it contains 50 percent of your zinc RDA and - check it out - five times your B12 RDA. <b>Avoid</b> Blue crab, which has higher levels of PCBs and mercury.<br /><br /><b>8. Perch</b> (freshwater). One serving provides over 100 percent of your omega-3 minimum, almost all of your selenium (47 mcg), and half of your B12, with no measurable mercury. So eat up! <br /><br /><b>9. Clams</b> score you 0.2 g of omega-3s (some tests reveal that they can contain as much as 0.5 g). A single serving also has 350 percent of the 15-mg RDA for iron and a colossal 84 mcg of B12. All that with a mere 0.02 ppm of mercury.<br /><br /><b>10. Scallops</b> have a meaty texture even steak lovers can appreciate. Both the bay and sea varieties are heart friendly, with 0.3 g of omega-3s, more than half your B12 RDA, and only a hint of mercury (0.05 ppm). <br /><br /><b>11. Shrimp</b> are a dieter's dream at only 84 calories per serving, with 0.3 g of omega-3s and a super-safe mercury level of 0.05 ppm. The drawback: A serving of shrimp has 166 mg of cholesterol (almost as much as an egg), so if you're watching your cholesterol, don't eat the pink critters more than once a week.<br /><br /><b>12. Catfish</b> (if farmed) has 0.2 g of healthy fats, over 100 percent of your B12 RDA, and only 0.05 ppm of mercury. But the whiskered fish's biggest claim to fame is 14.3 mcg of muscle- and bone-building vitamin D - almost three times your RDA.<br /><br /><b>13. Haddock</b> gives up a good bit of omega-3s (0.2 g), 63 percent of your selenium, and over half of your B12 RDA. And barely-there mercury (0.03 ppm) makes it an anytime entr? <br /><br /><b>14. Tilapia</b> is a freshwater dweller similar to catfish. Though it has only 0.1 g of omega-3s, tilapia is nearly free of mercury (0.01 ppm) and contains 84 percent of your daily selenium and 79 percent of your B12. So you can eat it till the sharks come home.<br /><br /><b>15. Lobster</b> (the spiny kind). Spiny lobster doesn't have claws like the monsters from Maine, but its tail has tons more omega-3s (0.4 g vs. 0.07 g) and a lot less mercury (0.09 ppm vs. 0.3 ppm). Other highlights include 50 percent of your zinc RDA, 91 percent of your selenium, and nearly twice your RDA of B12.<br /><br /><b>16. Canned tuna</b> (light). It's saddled with more mercury (0.12 ppm) than most fish on this list, but it has the least of all other types of tuna and still provides 0.2 g of omega-3s. Eat it no more than eight times a month and feel good about getting 75 percent of your niacin RDA and more than 100 percent of your selenium and B12.<br /><br /><b>17. Cod</b> (from the Pacific) supplies almost twice the omega-3s of Atlantic cod (0.2 g vs. 0.1 g) and racks up 72 percent of your selenium for just 89 calories a serving. But don't dine on it more than twice a week, because its mercury count is on the high side (0.1 ppm).<br /><br /><b>18. Halibut </b>is a very good source of omega-3s (0.4 g) and provides more than 40 percent of your RDA of niacin, 72 percent of your selenium, and 58 percent of B12, so eating it every once in a while is a healthy option. Just keep it to no more than four meals per month because its 0.2-ppm mercury count is twice as high as cod's. <br /><br /><b>19. Skipjack</b> tuna is smaller than bluefin or yellowfin and therefore soaks up fewer toxins. It delivers an impressive 0.3 g of omega-3s, 72 percent of your selenium RDA, and 93 percent of B12. Still, it has 0.2 ppm of mercury, so limit it to four meals a month. <br /><br /><b>20. Orange roughy</b> has two strikes against it: minimal omega-3s (0.02 g) and way more mercury (0.6 ppm) than any other fish listed here. But it's low in calories and high in protein and selenium (75 mcg). So if you're craving it, go ahead - just not more than once a month.<br /><br /><br />Need ideas on how to cook your big catch?

But it doesn't have to be. ""Of course calories count,"" says Dawn Jackson Blatner, R.D., a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association, ""but there are plenty of ways to cut them without a math Ph.D."" In fact, some simple lifestyle changes are often more effective for <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/set/?keycode=142686"">weight loss success</a> than obsessive number crunching. Follow these four strategies and the only figure you'll be thinking about is the smokin' one in the mirror.<br /><b><br />Instead counting calories - Try joining a club</b><br /><b>Because</b> Keeping a running total is a little like guessing how many jelly beans are in a Mason jar. According to a 2006 study published in the <i>Annals of Internal Medicine,</i> Americans--even those who are at a healthy weight-­-consistently lowball the number of calories in large fast-food meals by up to 38 percent. </p><p>For portion control without the decimal points, sign up for a delivery service like DeliciouslyYours (ediets.com) or Health Management Resources (hmrprogram.com). They deliver meals in just-right sizes to your doorstep each week. And the foods they consist of are usually high in <a target=""_blank"" href=""/weight-loss/weight-loss-tips-2"">fiber</a> and protein, so you won't feel deprived, says Anne Fletcher, R.D., author of <i>Thin for Life. </i></p><p>Another, er, plus: The <a target=""_blank"" href=""/weight-loss/lose-weight-faster-0"">smaller portions</a> train you to recognize proper serving sizes, so you'll make smarter choices when the <a target=""_blank"" href=""/nutrition/premium-packaged-foods"">prepackaged food</a> is out of reach. You can enroll in a meal-delivery service for $12 to $20 a day; there are good options in the freezer aisle too, says Elisa Zied, R.D., author of <i>So What Can I Eat?!</i> Look for frozen meals that have less than 500 calories and have at least four grams of fiber, no more than 15 grams of fat (fewer than three grams saturated and no trans fat), and fewer than 700 milligrams of sodium. </p><p><b>Instead eating by food ratios - Try eye-balling labels</b><br /><b>Because</b> If diets like the Zone, Atkins, or South Beach didn't work for you, it may not be because you couldn't give up bagels. It could be because you're too damn busy to bother updating percentages and ratios at every meal. If you don't have Rain Man keeping tabs on your meals, try this instead: Take 15 seconds to scan food labels for key ingredients. According to a 2007 report by the USDA Economic Research Service, we spend an average of 30 percent of our annual grocery bill on foods such as <a target=""_blank"" href=""/nutrition/muffin-recipes"">muffins, cakes, cupcakes,</a> cookies, crackers, ice cream, candy, soda, and doughnuts--foods whose ingredients lists have sugar at or near the top. It's a pretty big duh that sweeteners jack up calories, but they also take your blood sugar on a roller-coaster ride that lands you right back at the fridge. We call it the theory of ""calories in, calories in.""</p><p>End the snacking madness by making natural, whole foods the bulk of your diet. That includes fruits, veggies, and lean meats such as chicken, turkey, flank steak, pork chops, and fish, plus these <a href=""/weight-loss/foods-that-burn-fat"">foods that burn fat.</a> And when stocking up on packaged foods, choose ones ""that list whole foods, such as whole-wheat flour, oats, peanuts, and real fruit, in the first line of ingredients,"" Zied says. That's your clue that a food is lower in calories and higher in fiber and protein than one with a lot of high-fructose corn syrup, sugar, molasses, or even honey.</p><p><b>Instead of logging 30 minutes on the treadmill - Try pumping up to scale down</b><br /><b>Because </b>According to a recent review by a Duke University medical research­er, treadmill displays inflate the number of calories you burn by 10 to 15 percent. The study also found that 20 percent of us reward ourselves after exercise by eating as many calories as we worked off--and that we're less inclined to get physical after a strenuous workout for two to six hours. That's when we'll veg out on the couch instead of do housework. </p><p>A more efficient way to counteract dessert is to <a target=""_blank"" href=""/fitness/cardio-vs-strength-training-workouts"">pump iron</a>. Though cardio torches more calories minute-for-minute than lifting, weight training keeps your internal furnace going long after you put down the dumbbells. A study in the journal <i>Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise</i> found that after six months of lifting weights three days a week, subjects increased their resting metabolic rate (that's the number of calories you burn just sitting on your butt) by 7 percent. To squeeze the most out of every curl and squat, speed it up: Another study in the same ­journal found that lifting quickly (for example, during a squat, lowering for two seconds, then coming up as fast as you can) fries calories 11 percent faster than lifting slowly. Researchers think the explosive movements create more calorie-melting muscle contractions. </p><p><b>Instead of measuring each bite - Try enjoying each bite</b><br /><b>Because</b> Being a slave to your kitchen scale won't make the one in your bathroom budge faster. A 2007 study in the <i>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</i> confirmed that it is possible to <a target=""_blank"" href=""/weight-loss/weight-loss-snacks"">eat more and still slim down</a>. The study compared weight loss in two groups of obese women. All of them were told to eat a reduced-fat diet, but one group was also instructed to consume a lot of water-rich foods, like soups, fruits, and vegetables. That group ate 25 percent more food by volume but lost more weight (an average of 17.5 pounds versus 14). How? They were eating fewer calories, but were still satisfied, thanks to the foods' high water content. ""Physical activity was the same in both groups, so if the people in one group lost more, they had to have eaten fewer calories,"" says lead study author Barbara Rolls, Ph.D. </p><p>Instead of measuring your meals, try a more measured approach to eating. It takes your brain 12 to 15 minutes to receive the signal that your stomach is at max capacity, so wait for it. If you pause between bites, chances are you'll get that signal before you've scarfed down seconds. Don't have that kind of self-control? Choose foods that are impossible to bolt down: produce you have to peel, nuts in the shell, and spicy foods.<br /><br /><br /></p>",healthy eating

We see totally eye to eye on this stuff. We've even agreed on our one disagreement. I want bridesmaids and groomsmen; she thinks they distract from what should be the true focus of the ceremony: us. ""That's fine,"" I say. ""You can have no bridesmaids, but I'm going to have a dozen people standing behind me during the ceremony - my best friends and yours."" The compromise seems ingenious to me. ""You're a dork,"" Anne says.<br /><br />""I love you"" is what I think she means. And I love Anne too. There's really just one hitch to our getting hitched. We haven't set a wedding date yet. We haven't, um, gotten engaged yet, and we've been <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/the-average-woman-and-dating"">dating</a> for the better part of the 21st century. I feel completely solid about us, and Anne does too, but occasionally I get scared. I mean, you and me together, forever...for life?<br /><br />For help, I know I could stroll down the relationship-lit lane at Barnes & Noble and peruse any of 8,572 titles. But these days, the place to go for the most intriguing discoveries about the nature of long-term relationships is the lab. Scientists are doing brain scans of people in love and genetic tests on animals that display <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/cheating-on-your-wife"">monogamous</a> behavior. We've all heard too much about why people split up; these researchers are studying our brain chemistry to see what makes us stick together.<br /><br />One of them - Helen Fisher, Ph.D., an anthropologist at Rutgers University, the author of <i>Why We Love</i>, and a <i>WH</i> advisor - believes that the human body has three separate amorous systems, each ruled by a distinct group of brain chemicals. One system elicits <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/spice-up-your-sex-life"">lust</a>, which gets you hot for any stranger with a passing resemblance to Owen Wilson and encourages you to do your part to keep <i>Homo sapiens</i> in business. Another chemical cocktail encourages romantic love, focusing your attention on Mr. Right, not just Mr. Right Now. The third (and in some ways most complex) chemical system fosters attachment. It's the one that helps keep you and your beloved together for the long haul. ""People tend to think of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/open-relationship"">monogamy</a> as almost magical, but there's no reason to believe that,"" Dr. Fisher says. ""Depression isn't magical. Fear isn't magical. Why should something like monogamy be magical?""<br /><br />Okay, that sounds great. But if brain chemicals are working to help us stay faithful, why can monogamy feel so much like hard work? As you might suspect from hard-won experience or tabloid brouhahas (think Heather and Denise and Richie), the chemicals that promote long-term commitment aren't foolproof. It's not that they aren't powerful, scientists say. It's just that they don't cancel out love's other two biochemical systems. That's why you can simultaneously feel a warm sense of attachment to your spouse - and feverish lust for your cute new coworker. <br /><br />Still, now that experts are learning more about the physiology of faithfulness, I can't help but wonder: Can we manipulate it to strengthen our relationships? In other words, can we call on science in the service of love?<br /><br />To find out, I decide to undertake a little personal experimentation. I plan a date for Anne and me. This won't be just any date - no mere dinner and a movie - but a date supported by cutting-edge research in psychology, biochemistry, and neurology - by the latest findings on mate selection, pair bonding, and, most important, monogamy. A date backed by the full revelatory power of Modern Science. To discover what we're up against - to learn how monogamous or not people are at their animal core - we begin with a trip to Brooklyn's Prospect Park Zoo.<br /><br /><b>Those Slutty Swans</b><br /><br />If you've ever spent much time at a zoo, you've probably noticed a couple of things. One, animals are super-cute. Two, animals are super-pervy. Anne and I walk up to a pond where Sea Otter Number One playfully tries to bite the neck of Sea Otter Number Two. They swim in rapid circles, forming a sort of sea otter doughnut. Then they adopt another, less playful position. A guy in a ball cap strolls up with his girlfriend. ""Look, the little otters are trying to do business in the water!"" he exclaims. <br /><br />In the aviary, a Demoiselle crane perches atop long stick legs, his glassy red eyes and crest of white feathers giving him the look of a dotty old professor. A placard proclaims: ""These birds mate for life."" In the baboon enclosure, meanwhile, a half-dozen females slink about with bright red butts pointed skyward, indicating their readiness to mate - all with the one male who runs the harem. Hot sex, multiple partners, a thumping jungle beat - isn't there any decency in the wild kingdom? We're looking for some inspiration, but what we're seeing makes us suspect that the faithful crane is in the minority. Indeed, as I am to later learn from the experts, most animals are less <i>Leave It to Beaver</i> than they are <i>Big Love</i>. <br /><br />Until fairly recently, biologists thought there was plenty of fidelity in the animal world. They watched Ma and Pa bird - eagles, parrots, Canada geese - happily split responsibilities to raise their brood. Ah, togetherness. Then came DNA testing, and lo! Turns out that one in six offspring of the graceful swan - long the gold standard of monogamy - is illegitimate. And this sluttiness is shockingly widespread. Some 30 percent of the time, it turns out, male birds unknowingly rear chicks that are not their own. As for mammals, fewer than 5 percent are monogamous. And most of those critters, like the swans, are what researchers politely call ""socially monogamous,"" meaning they shack up together but screw around on the side. Among primates, scientists now believe that only two species are truly faithful. Guess which ones? The marmoset...and the tamarin. <br /><br />What about us humans? Genetic studies indicate that the traditional human family may have been a harem. Not a very encouraging history, but we moderns are governed by more than base instinct, right? We have religion, culture, and Dr. Phil - not to mention those helpful monogamy chemicals - on our side. <br /><br />Well, yes, but according to David Barash, Ph.D., and Judith Lipton, M.D., coauthors of <i>The Myth of Monogamy</i>, we also have another mighty drive: to procreate with the best possible partner, who may not always be our own. Within each of our bodies, Luke is fighting Darth, and the Dark Side sometimes wins. ""In attempting to maintain a social and sexual bond consisting exclusively of one man and one woman, aspiring monogamists are going against some of the deepest-seated evolutionary inclinations with which biology has endowed most creatures, <i>Homo sapiens</i> included,"" Drs. Barash and Lipton write. <br /><br />So apparently it makes evolutionary sense for me to be a skank. It's simple math: The more women I impregnate, the more kids I'll have. I'd like to think Anne is less likely to stray - and certainly scientists used to believe that women, who make a huge investment of resources in each child, were choosier about their mates and more faithful once they picked one.<br /><br />What do scientists say now? That two-timing works just as well for women. They can't boost reproductive quantity the way a male can - a woman can't get pregnant more than once at a time - but it serves their evolutionary interests to improve the quality of their offspring. In countless bird species, for instance, biologists have observed what happens when the male is away. If an ugly suitor flies up to the nest, the female won't give him the time of day. But if the gentleman caller is the bird equivalent of Jude Law, and healthier than her mate, she's likely to engage in what's known in the animal behavior trade as an EPC, or extra-pair copulation - an avian booty call. Birds aren't people, to be sure, but the rules of evolution work the same for all of us. <br /><br />Hmmm, the zoo is getting kinda depressing. Hardly a bastion of monogamous family values. Time to move on.<br /><br /><b>Dose 'Em with Oxytocin</b><br /><br />A couple of weeks before our zoo outing, I was poking around the Internet and came across a product called Liquid Trust. This body spray would make me ""instantly irresistible"" and was ""the ultimate tool for starting and keeping long-lasting relationships"" - all for only $29.95, plus shipping and handling. I ordered some and spritzed myself liberally before the date.<br /><br />After exiting the zoo, I pull Anne in close for a hug, giving her plenty of time to inhale. ""What's your level of attachment to me right now?"" I ask. ""Any extra passion or...arousal?"" She gives me a funny look. ""I'm at the zoo. I'm a little sweaty,"" she says. ""No.""<br /><br />Score: Anne, 1; Liquid Trust, 0.<br /><br />Liquid Trust's active ingredient is the hormone oxytocin. Studies have recently shown that if you inhale the stuff, you tend to trust people more and feel less anxiety in social situations. The body spray I bought is probably too weak to be effective - in the studies, subjects inhaled a much more potent dose - but the effects of oxytocin are scientifically legit. In fact, the hormone is released during sex and cuddling and is believed to be one of the key players in the biochemistry of monogamy. <br /><br />Much of what we know about oxytocin comes from studies of a small rodent, the humble prairie vole. Picture, if you will, the lab-rodent version of <i>Temptation Island</i>. Scientists rig a Habitrail with multiple chambers, plop in some guy and gal voles, and watch the sexual sparks fly. Prairie voles, as it happens, are pro-family types that tend to be highly monogamous. And when dosed with extra oxytocin and a related hormone, vasopressin, they become even more faithful than normal. Females will shack up with a stranger much faster than usual, and males will enter into what amounts to a vole marriage before they even have sex. <br /><br />A couple of years ago, a team led by neuroscientist Larry Young, Ph.D., of Emory University discovered what the media quickly dubbed the ""monogamy gene."" Here's how it works: The brain cells of voles are studded with areas called receptors that grab specific chemicals like oxytocin and vasopressin.<br /><br />Think of these bonding hormones as baseballs and the receptors as catchers' mitts.) In prairie voles, the monogamy gene ensures that most of the receptors for oxytocin and vasopressin are located in parts of the brain associated with recognition and reward. So when these voles mate, their reward circuitry goes wild. The result is that prairie voles become convinced not only that ""sex feels good,"" but that ""sex with this particular partner feels good."" <br /><br />The prairie vole has a closely related cousin, the meadow vole, from the wrong side of the tracks. Monogamous? Heck no. They act like college kids on an episode of <i>Girls Gone Wild</i>. Meadow voles, it turns out, have a different version of the monogamy gene that creates fewer vasopressin receptors in the brain's reward circuitry. So sex is less pleasurable and less memorable - and brings no special feeling of amorous attachment. Unless, that is, Dr. Young and company inject meadow voles with the prairie vole version of the monogamy gene. Then, the roguish meadow voles become stand-up guys.<br /><br />If this sounds too critter-centric, hang on. Humans likely have the monogamy gene too, and as with voles, there are different versions. Depending on which version you have - whether it locates your oxytocin receptors (remember those catchers' mitts) in your reward circuitry or not - the gene will steer you to Juliet-like fidelity or Cleopatra-like hanky panky.<br /><br />So Anne and I may be genetically predisposed to either faithfulness or heartless running around. Experts think that in the next decade or two, it might become possible to find out for sure via a genetic test. Of course, many technological bridges would have to be crossed first. Ethical ones too. If you could give your fiancé a monogamy gene test as easily as an AIDS test, does that mean you should? After all, DNA isn't destiny. Just because your father is an alcoholic doesn't mean you will become one too. So genetic knowledge about monogamy might be power - but it might also be a curse.<br /><br /><b>Answers from on High</b><br /><br />Anne and I hop on our bikes and head for Coney Island, 7 miles away. Pedaling fast on a hot day, we quickly work up a sweat. After locking up our bikes at the boardwalk, we head for Coney's star attraction. The Cyclone isn't the world's tallest roller coaster or the fastest, but that doesn't prevent it from being terrifying. The rickety wooden contraption was built when Calvin Coolidge was president; Charles Lindbergh once proclaimed that his ride on the Cyclone was more exciting than his solo flight across the Atlantic. The track creaks and groans as the coaster climbs the main hill. Then, as Anne and I plunge from the top and rip into the first turn, it feels like the whole structure is going to tear apart, sending bolts, timber, and screaming riders flying into the ocean.<br /><br />I look over at Anne. Her dark hair is swept back in a ponytail; her eyes are pinched shut above flushed cheeks. She looks totally scared. She looks totally hot. <br /><br />""Wow, that was not fun,"" she says as we unload from the ride. I tell her how sexy she looked and get no response. After a couple of minutes, though, she sheepishly says, ""I do feel sort of attracted to you right now.""<br /><br />Aha! Just as I predicted!<br /><br />To understand why a bike ride/roller coaster combo would make a couple feel amorous, consider a study done last year by Dr. Fisher and Art Aron, Ph.D., a psychologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Drs. Fisher and Aron took people who had recently fallen madly in love and showed them photos of their partners while scanning their brains with a technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging. Their love-addled brains looked the same as the brains of people who are high on crack cocaine. <br /><br />Turns out intense romantic love produces heavy doses of dopamine, your brain's natural you-done-good award. Whether triggered by love or illicit drugs, dopamine makes you feel exhilarated, energetic, and euphoric. Here's the big ""but"": The dopamine rush weakens as the years you spend in a relationship (or doing drugs) tick by. And that less intense rush, say scientists, is one of the main reasons monogamy is difficult. <br /><br />I ask Drs. Fisher and Aron if there are ways to sustain it. Yes, they say. You just need to trick your brain.<br /><br />Trick #1: Exercise with your partner. Any pulse-raising activity is a safe and street-legal way to boost dopamine. And it may do more than that. In a famous study, psychologist Gregory L. White told one group of people to jog in place for several minutes and another group to jog for just a few seconds. Then Dr. White introduced both groups to members of the opposite sex. The people who had exercised first were more likely to rate the person they met as attractive. How come? They confused the jogging-produced flutter in their hearts for the flutter of sexual attraction.<br /><br />Trick #2: Do new and exciting things together. In 1974, Dr. Aron did a famous experiment in which he put an attractive woman on a high, shaky suspension bridge over a river. When men walked by on the bridge, she asked them to fill out a survey and write a short narrative. After they finished, she would coyly write down what she said was her home phone number and ask the men to call if they had any questions. The same woman also gave the questionnaire on a much lower and more stable bridge. That night, the phone began to ring - and most of the callers were the men who had filled out the q
estionnaire on the shaky bridge. What's more, the narratives written on the shaky bridge had much more sexual content. It seems the danger of that bridge raised the men's adrenaline levels. And adrenaline can trigger dopamine, Dr. Fisher says.<br /><br />Turns out the roller coaster made us feel frisky not just because it was scary but because it was new - Anne and I had never ridden one together. According to Dr. Aron, novelty is the best relationship booster. ""Doing new activities creates a sense of excitement and charge,"" he says. ""If you do that with your partner, you link it with him or her. It's just that simple.""<br /><br />So here's to shaky bridges - and the Cyclone.<br /><br /><b>Coney Island Canoodling</b><br /><br />As the sun dips lower, Anne and I wander the boardwalk through crowds of kids, balloon vendors, and old men with too much chest hair and too-little Speedos. On a bench facing the ocean, we sit holding hands - a spontaneous gesture but, as my research suggests, one that is particularly well timed.<br /><br />Trick #3: Cuddle. A University of North Carolina study found that husbands and wives who get warm hugs several times a day from their spouses have higher oxytocin levels in their blood. Anne and I are in G-rated territory here on the boardwalk, but my thoughts are veering toward triple X - all the more so when I realize that Anne's are too. ""What time do we have to be at that party tonight?"" she asks slyly, clearly calculating whether we'll have enough time for some predinner nooky. <br /><br />Which brings me to Trick #4: Do the deed. Sex is essentially one-stop shopping for the chemicals that promote and enhance attachment. Foreplay - nipple and genital touching - causes oxytocin and vasopressin levels to rise. Orgasm sends them through the roof. In the afterglow, you'll be high on endogenous opioids - your body's natural form of heroin. <br /><br />Anne and I are surrounded by the festive sound of bottle rockets exploding over the beach. A cruise ship inches its way out into the open sea. She tips her head against my shoulder. Was it a great date because it was backed by the science of monogamy? Or was it simply a great date? We didn't know. And at the moment, we really didn't care. <br />",relationships

Here are three snacking strategies that come with a no-gorge guarantee:</p><p><b>Just add air</b><br /> Foods that are pumped full of air make your stomach feel inflated without giving you a beach-ball belly. In a study published last year in the journal <i>Appetite, </i>Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., author of <i>The Volumetrics Eating Plan</i> and the director of the Laboratory for the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Penn State, served visitors to her lab either crunchy cheese snacks or more aerated puffy cheese snacks. Those munching the puffier snacks consumed nearly 75 percent more by volume, but they took in 20 percent fewer calories. ""When something is full of air, an equal amount looks bigger, so people tend to take in fewer calories,"" Rolls says. If you nosh on air-puffed snacks on a diet, you'll be able to eat more without your gut suffering the consequences--and you can stretch yoursnackover an entire episode of <i>Mad Men</i> instead of blowing it all in the first commercial break. </p><p> <b>Scarf this</b><b>Popchips </b><br />Potato, corn, and rice chips with 20 percent fewer cal­ories than traditional chips <br />120 calories per ounce<br /><b>Cheetos Natural White Cheddar Puffs </b><br />150 calories per ounce<br /><b>Quaker Caramel Corn Quakes Rice snacks </b><br />60 calories for 7 cakes</p> <p><b>Think thick</b><br /> As far as your muffin top is concerned, all calories are created equal. But your brain plays favorites. ""Liquids don't seem to trigger the same response in metabolism and hunger suppression that solids do,"" says Susan Swithers, Ph.D., of Purdue University's Ingestive Behavior Research Center. ""You're consuming calories, but your brain doesn't really register them, so you still feel hungry and can overeat without realizing it."" The good news: Experts speculate that thicker liquids, such as smoothies, are recognized as food by your brain's appetite center, so they can help you get to that couldn't-eat-­another-bite feeling. </p><p>Dutch researchers backed up the idea with a study pub­lished this year in the <i>International Journal of Obe­sity.</i> After offering unlimited amounts of chocolate in three forms--milk, custard, and a beverage with a consistency between the two--they found (in addition to, we bet, a lot of eager volunteers) that those who had the chocolate milk consumed 30 percent more calories than those who ate the pudding. The mid-consistency mixture fared somewhere in the middle.</p><p><b>Scarf this </b><br /><b>Jell-O sugar-free pudding cups dark chocolate and raspberry </b><br />60 calories per 3.75 oz<br /><b>Mott's Plus Sauce cups pomegranate</b><br />50 calories per 3.9 oz <br /><b>Dannon Light & Fit 0% Plus, vanilla flavor</b><br />50 calories per 4 oz</p><p><b>Spice it up</b><br /> Spices have a good track record as a weight-loss tool. One study showed that spiking soup with a big dose of red pepper led to consuming fewer calories in subsequent meals. Not only does the hot sensation slow you down, pepper may cause thermogenesis (your body literally heats up, burning a few extra calories in the process). Another reason to kick it up a notch: Food scientists in Taiwan report that capsaicin, the compound that gives red pepper its pow, may prove lethal to fat cells, killing them before they can fully form. There's common sense as well as science at work here, says Judith S. Stern, Sc.D., a professor of nutrition and internal medicine at the University of California, Davis.

The science behind self-control</b><br /> Your inability to put on the brakes when you're chomping something yummy is about more than wimpy willpower. Evidence suggests that we evolved to crave fattening food. ""Our taste buds have special sets of receptors that pick up flavors associated with calorie-dense foods, and even newborn babies are born with a desire for sweet things,"" says Gary Beauchamp, Ph.D., director of Philadelphia's Monell Chemical Senses Center. Our hairy human ancestors were mostly herb­ivores--today they'd be called vegans--and getting enough calories was a daily struggle. To avoid starving to death, they had to learn to recognize calorie- and nutrient-dense foods by their taste and texture. As a result, we inherited a powerful hankering for anything sweet (a sure sign of energy-boosting sugar) or fatty (a guarantee of precious calories).</p><p>Now that we're no longer digging up roots, picking berries, and chasing woolly mammoths, calorie-dense foods are more of a curse than a blessing. Further proof that Mother Nature is determined to foil your weight-loss plans: Fat combined with salt or sugar gives your mouth the flavor equivalent of an orgasm, so sugary, high-fat foods (like ice cream) and salty, high-fat foods (like Doritos) are especially delectable, says food scientist Mary Ellen Camire, Ph.D. Seem depressing? Chin up--evolution may have stacked the deck, but ultimately you deal the cards.</p> ",
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/meaning-of-a-smile,Life,53,46,10,25,11,0,9,0,,Body Language: What's Really Behind a Smile?,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/power-of-smile_0.jpg,"<p>Studies show that people think they already know someone if that person smiles at them, even if it's an absolute stranger. The theory: Scientists believe the need to bond is rooted in our evolutionary past. Survival was more likely when people combined forces, so humans acquired the smile as a way to signal friendliness and to induce an agreeable sense of shared history, whether there was one or not.<br /><br />Today, when someone smiles, a glum mood is lifted, an apology is accepted, a person's shaky self-confidence gets a boost, a deal is struck, a physical attraction is communicated. But change the cast of a smile and the consequences shift. A rival grins to get under your skin; a bully smirks to unsettle his mark. Understanding the nuances helps ensure that you send-and receive-the right mouth message. Here, some intriguing insights about this familiar gesture.</p><p><strong>Outer Smile, Inner Darkness</strong><br />Ironically, a smile can express contempt. Bullies-whether they're on the playground or in the office-may want the recipients to see their glee and realize their malevolent intent. The result is a conscious disconnect between outward expression and inner feelings. Other times, the disconnect may be unconscious, the result of pushing aside negative feelings. A person may have heard as a child that enraged feelings should never be expressed, so even the slightest inkling of anger is covered with a smile.</p><p><strong>The Most Powerful Expression</strong><br />Even a fleeting smile has the capacity to burrow deep into the subconscious of the person who sees it and set off positive changes from within. For example, a smile of just a mere four-hundredths of a second (what researchers refer to as subliminal priming) is enough to produce a mini emotional high in others; it makes people see things around them in a more positive light. Boring material becomes more interesting, or a nondescript picture seems to have more flair. Indeed, researchers have found that some foods even taste better when preceded by a subliminal smile. And what's more, these expressions are contagious: In one study, when participants were exposed to these smiles-even though they couldn't remember seeing them-their own faces mirrored what they ""saw."" </p><p><strong>Don't Believe It</strong><br />Liars don't smile more than truth tellers, a recent study confirmed. However, they do display more manufactured smiles. They use these expressions to divert others from the fact that they're being handed a bill of goods. The exception: When liars had to make up a lie on the spot (as opposed to having time to prepare their story), they tended to display spontaneous embarrassed smiles-which suggests discomfort with their attempt to fake someone out.</p><p><strong>Which Came First: The Emotion or the Smile?</strong><br />You may think facial expressions simply reflect your feelings, but to some extent they cause them as well. In fact, studies have shown that expressions may act like the volume control on an MP3 player: Rev up your smile, rev up your feelings; turn down your smile, turn down your feelings. </p><p><strong>A Matter of Trust</strong><br />People's facial expressions often drive our gut feelings toward them. In one study, a group of students were asked to imagine they were members of a college disciplinary panel that had to determine whether or not a student had cheated on an exam. They were each given a folder that contained background material suggesting the person had cheated, and clipped to the outside of the folder was a photograph of the accused-in some of the photos, she was smiling; in others, she displayed a neutral expression. Nearly all the study participants decided the student was guilty, but those who had seen the smiling photo thought she should be given the benefit of the doubt. To them, that smile meant she was trustworthy. </p><p><strong>Genuine vs. Plastered On</strong><br />Not all grins come naturally. There are real, spontaneous smiles, and then there are the fake, manufactured ones we put on consciously. What's different about them? Psychophysiologist Gary Schwartz and his colleagues found that manufactured smiles are on average 10 times bigger than spontaneous ones, most likely because their point is to be seen. They appear abruptly, stay at their peak a disproportionately long time, and exit as quickly as they arrived. In contrast, spontaneous smiles emerge more slowly and gradually, and they are brief but repetitive. Genuine delight is reflected more often as a sequence of short smile bursts, rather than a smile that arrives and stays put. They involve not only changes around the mouth (the retraction of the mouth corners), but around the eyes as well (creases at the corners and skin bunching under the eyes). </p><p><strong>True Love or Sexual Passion?</strong><br />Can a smile reflect the difference? Absolutely. Social psychologists believe that deep love and passionate sexual attraction elicit entirely different types of smiles. The more two people are in love, the more they show genuine smiles in each other's company. On the flip side, people who report high levels of sexual desire-but not a whole lot of love-show fewer genuine smiles and a greater number of other lip actions (e.g., lip bites and licks). In short, genuine smiles communicate the desire to be close; lip movements convey passion. </p><p><strong>Mixed Signals</strong><br />Men like to see women smile. In fact, studies show that men are considerably more attracted to women who flash grins. But a lot of times those megawatt beams are misinterpreted. Studies have found that what women intend as mere friendliness is often misconstrued by men as flirtatiousness and a signal of sexual interest. Women, on the other hand, tend to see a man's smile as a supportive gesture. </p><p><strong>The Gender Divide</strong><br />Studies reveal that women smile significantly more than men do, especially in their late teens and as young adults. No surprise: It's a time when each gender is sending out heavy sexual signals. Also, males are less likely to return a smile, especially to another guy. Blame testosterone: Studies show that men with high levels are averse to smiling. But there are times when smiling is the best way to convey masculinity. When men smile under duress or laugh at fear, they're showing that everything is under control.</p>",

This date is a combination of scouting out an organic farm and spending an evening at the stove, so it's best saved for a lazy Saturday when you might otherwise be, you know, working your way through a crossword puzzle in the park. The best part about organic grub: You don't have to be Mario Batali to whip up a decent spread, thanks to the tastiness of fresh local produce and meat. You could pop down to the farmers' market, but visiting a nearby farm makes it more of an adventure (to find both, visit localharvest.org). Start by snagging some arugula or rocket lettuce and harvesting organic tomatoes, then move on to a dairy farm for milk and cheese. Top it off with a visit to a local butcher for some grass-fed beef or free-range chicken.</p><p><i><b>The cliche:</b></i> Having brunch <br /><i><b>Break it by: </b></i><b>Making a barbecue pilgrimage</b><br />""Let's do brunch,"" you say.

So decamp to your local barbecue joint, preferably one with picnic tables out back, for a brunch of porcine and bovine delicacies. Having the foresight to scout out this hog heaven will score you major points, and as he powers through wet wipes and drains his brew, his defenses will drop.

The events unfold throughout the summer and early fall, pitting teams against one another in a multidiscipline competition set in the urban jungle. Evading dodge balls, wielding high-pressure fire hoses, rappelling down buildings, and charming snakes as a team will make you appreciate your partner's strengths and weaknesses, help you get used to working through conflicts-and even boost your libido.

The curve-baring costumes don't hurt, but a woman with a weapon oozes confidence and strength, and has an edge that guys find alluring. Your move: Hit the firing range with your man to unleash your inner Lara Croft. If he knows his way around a .45, maybe you'll even buff his ego by asking for some help with your stance. Squeezing off a dozen rounds is an instant release, and the implicit sense of danger-one wrong move and things can go bad-dumps dopamine into your system, which may boost your sex drive. Let's face it: Smacking little white balls at the driving range pales next to shooting a handheld weapon capable of stopping a charging rhinoceros. Visit wheretoshoot.org to find a range near you.

Point being, the primal release of slathering a canvas with pigment releases something in a man. Here's how to unleash his inner artist: Grab a couple of canvases from a local art store-they won't set you back more than $15-as well as a starter kit of paints, a few brushes, and a blanket. You don't need anything fancy, and the back of a pizza box can even serve as a mixing palette. Bring a lantern, some bug spray, and maybe even an actual pizza, and set up shop on top of a big hill in town. By the time the sun has set, you'll have added the finishing touches and you'll be waiting for the paint to dry before packing up to go home. Which is when the second part of this date comes in. Blanket? Night sky? You do the math.</p>",Simplify Your Life

Though some of the fluffy options may look as kooky as they sound, they can help reduce stiff necks and <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/snoring"">snoring</a>. Your sleeping position can determine which pillow is best for you, says Joseph Ojile, M.D., founder and managing director of the Clayton Sleep Institute in St. Louis, Missouri. ""You want a cushion that keeps your head in a neutral position--and that's going to differ depending on your <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/what-you-should-know-about-sleep"">sleep</a> position."" Read on to help you learn how to fall asleep fast.<br /><br /><b>1. If you sleep on your stomach</b><br />Tummy sleepers need a thinner, flatter cushion--elevate your head too much and sleeping becomes like holding cobra pose. The <b>Select Comfort Nature Preference Pillow for Stomach Sleepers </b>(from $80, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.selectcomfort.com"">selectcomfort.com</a>) wicks away moisture (no waking up in a pile of drool), and its allergen-free fill means you can snuggle up face-first.<br /><br /><b>2. If you have allergies</b><br />Synthetic materials are an alternative to down and feathers, which can cause allergies and are a breeding hotbed for dust mites. <b>Lands' End Essential PureLoft</b> (from $19.50, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.landsend.com"">landsend.com</a>) has a chemical-free microfiber filling made with neem oil to naturally repel mites.<br /><br /><b>3. If you snore</b><br />It looks like someone took an ice-cream scoop to the <b>Sleep Better Medi Comfort Pillow </b>($35, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sleepbetter.org"">sleepbetter.org</a>). The hollowed-out area tilts your head back slightly; this keeps your throat open to help reduce snoring. The memory foam conforms to your head for a customized fit.<br /><br /><b>4. If you sleep on your back</b><br />Thick, stiff pillows can push a back sleeper's head too far up. Down pillows are best for squishability, but they aren't always supportive. Solution: The <b>Cuddledown Luxury Support Pillow</b> (from $99, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.cuddledown.com"">cuddledown.com</a>) combines a firm latex edge to support and relax your neck with a soft down area in the middle that lets your noggin rest in a neutral position.<br /><br /><b>5. If you sleep on your side</b><br />A plumper pillow fills up the space between your neck and your shoulder, keeping your spine perfectly aligned. The <b>Sealy Posturepedic Firm Support Pillow</b> (from $17, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sealybedding.com"">sealybedding.com</a>) has enough stuffing to keep your neck from sinking like a PT boat during the night.<br /><br /><b>Sound off</b><br />Everyone has their own surefire sleep tricks. <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/sleep-tips-0"">Tell us</a> yours!<br /><br />More from <i>WH</i>:<br /><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/sleep-meditation"">Meditate for Better Sleep</a><br /><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/sleep-deprivation"">The Cost of Lost Shuteye</a><br /><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/alarm-clocks"">The Best Alarm Clocks</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/sleep-better-0""><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/images/sleep-center/sleep-back-button.gif"" /><br /><br /></a><br />","sleep,Simplify Your Life"
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/lust,Sex And Relationships,117,45,19,13,0,20,0,0,,Fire Starters,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0603-where-is-lust-0586.jpg,"Despite the endless hype about how crucial <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/have-better-sex-1"">hot sex</a> is to a happy relationship, few couples on the planet actually do the deed every night. Even if you were married to Russell Crowe or....ooh, Christian Bale, there's no way you'd feel horny 365 days a year. In fact most couples go through periods when one or both partners would rather watch Animal Planet than make the beast with two backs. One study published in the <i>Journal of Marriage and Family Therapy</i> found that 24 percent of couples reported having a sexual drought in the past 3 months.<br /><br />Whether you're stressed, he's tired, or you both have something else on your minds, it's perfectly normal to have the occasional sex-free week. But if you've been low on <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/spice-up-your-sex-life"">lust</a> for a little too long, there are plenty of ways to reignite those love sparks. We identified four phases in relationships when sex drives typically fizzle and asked top experts for the best strategies to get you both back into a steamy groove.<br /><br /><b>Lackluster Phase #1: The Novelty Has Officially Worn Off</b><br /><br />When you first met, your mattress springs squeaked on a regular basis and you always had that dewy glow. That's because infatuation triggers the release of extra dopamine, a brain chemical that fuels your libido, says Laura Berman, Ph.D., director of the Berman Center for <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/sexual-health-basic-information"">sexual health</a> and menopause management in Chicago and author of <i>The Passion Prescription</i>. When the novelty wears off, so does the dopamine boost, Dr. Berman says.<br /><br /><b>Get Back on Track</b> Scare your pants off. Dopamine also kicks in when you're taken by surprise. ""Do things that are new and different together, even a little scary,"" Dr. Berman says. Even a relatively tame act can be a thrill if it's unexpected, says Sherry Amatenstein, relationship expert for iVillage.com and author of <i>Love Lessons from Bad Breakups</i>. Pick up a box of drugstore hair color (the kind that eventually washes out) and go to town on each other. You'll get that sexy hands-on-the-scalp feeling along with the risky excitement of not knowing quite how it's going to turn out.<br /><br /><b>Reset boundaries.</b> Sometimes people get so comfortable together they forget that sexual attraction requires a little mystery and excitement, says Mary Ann Donohue, Ph.D., administrative director of psychiatric services at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey. Maybe it's time to start closing the bathroom door, burping under your breath, and getting dressed up for bed the way you used to. And schedule some dates at swank venues - cocktails at a posh hotel bar or a night at the opera - where you have to dress up and act formal. Seeing each other looking your best and surrounded by lights, music, and other couples can bring back the thrill of dating, which will segue into livelier sex when you get home.<br /><br /><b>Lackluster Phase #2: You're About to Forsake All Others</b><br /><br />And one, or both, of you is freaking out. Before her wedding, ""I was so stressed about losing control over my life,"" says 33-year-old Stephanie T., who's been married to Joel for 10 years. For some of us, the idea of one sexual partner for a lifetime makes walking barefoot over thumbtacks sound more appealing than sauntering down the aisle.<br /><br /><b>Get Back on Track</b> Just do it. Sex is how guys say ""you're the center of my universe"" without having to utter the actual words. ""Women may want to shoot me for this, but in an otherwise good relationship, if you sometimes go ahead with sex even when you're not in the mood, the benefits can be significant,"" Dr. Berman says. Stop addressing those envelopes and undress each other instead. That 5-minute nooky break tells him he's more important than the florist or the caterer, Dr. Berman says. And it releases oxytocin, a hormone that makes you feel bonded and attached - so you'll remember the reason for those 200 invites in the first place.<br /><br /><b>Look beyond the big day.</b> Odds are on your side: Married women are more than twice as likely as single ones to have sex two or three times a week, according to a survey by the National Opinion Research Center. And that marriage bond will actually bring you closer. ""These last few years we've been very sexually connected,"" Joel says. What's different? He and Stephanie know each other better. ""Now we communicate about intimacy; we make time to do that. We've grown to understand the other person's sexuality and needs better, too.""<br /><br /><b><br />Lackluster Phase #3: One Of You Gets Pink-Slipped</b><br /><br />""We'd been dating for a year when Matt got fired,"" says Cynthia B., 41. ""He responded by withdrawing; he didn't want to sleep with me."" Stress - financial or otherwise - can cause levels of libido-stoking testosterone to drop, says Beverly Whipple, Ph.D., a neurophysiologist and coauthor of <i>The G-Spot: And Other Discoveries About Human Sexuality</i>. And when a guy loses his provider status it's a blow to his ego and manhood - not exactly the feeling he wants to bring into the bed. If you've been canned? Research reported in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> shows that when a woman's income is reduced by just 20 percent, her self-worth and sex drive can plummet.<br /><br /><b>Get Back on Track</b> Tackle it together. When he's the one taking the hit, form a united front, says Yvonne Thomas, Ph.D., a psychologist in Los Angeles. Refer to the issue as ""ours"" instead of ""his,"" which lets him know you don't blame him. Also make it clear that he hasn't lost any status in your eyes. Remind him how talented and capable he is. Then break out the massage oil and offer to rub his worries away. No, you're not his geisha girl, but playing that role for a night or two will pump up his self-esteem.<br /><br /><b>Think dirty thoughts.</b> When it's you in the stress-induced slump, talking about sex in a positive way can be powerful, Dr. Berman says. She suggests saying something like ""I miss being intimate with you."" It can help you recall your last intimate encounter - and all the delicious details - reminding you how good getting naked can make you feel.<br /><br /><b>Lackluster Phase #4: You're Baby Bombed</b><br /><br />Every parent you know points out the irony of having kids: The very act of creating them is unceremoniously sidelined once they're born. ""Our toddler has bad dreams a lot and wants to sleep in our bed,"" Rebecca B., 40, says. Not a sexy threesome.<br /><br />Sometimes just trying to get the sperm to sidle up to the egg can be enough to make your inner horndog hibernate. Janine L., 34, and Roger L., 35, tried for about a year to have a baby and wound up seeing an infertility specialist. ""When you're dealing with a fertility schedule, sex stops being fun,"" Roger says. ""Pair that with having to perform as often as possible during a brief monthly window and you start to lose your steam.""<br /><br />""He felt so much pressure that a couple of times he couldn't 'finish,'"" Janine adds. ""He'd feel guilty and embarrassed, which only made it worse.""<br /><br /><b>Get Back on Track</b> Do it when it doesn't count. When sex's end result is pure pleasure instead of pregnancy, you have fewer expectations and less likelihood of disappointment. So sneak in non-baby-making sex when you're not ovulating, Dr. Berman says. And if your bedroom has become ""fertility central,"" take the fun-only sex on tour. Your best bet? The closet - where, according to a University of California at Berkeley study, clothes emit a potent chemical from men's sweat, hair, and skin that arouses women. Who knew?<br /><br /><b>Schedule a grown-ups-only playdate.</b> Once kids arrive, ""getting regular alone time gives you a chance to talk like adults about intimate things,"" Dr. Whipple says. This may seem obvious, but as Rebecca admits, ""We're so busy, it wouldn't happen if we didn't plan it."" Sneak away for a day or two every few months. If you've got weather (and geography) on your side, head to the ocean. You'll have uninterrupted time for conversation in the car and - dopamine booster! - you can jump in for a late-night skinny-dip. Even the local Starbucks makes for an easy getaway. Talk like adults over cappuccino and use the caffeine perk for that crucial extra hour after the kids go to bed.<br />",Better Sex

But anyone who has ever had the pleasure of a scalp or face massage will be happy to know that top-floor TLC has benefits beyond simply feeling blissful. ""Massage increases blood flow, which plumps up slack skin, encourages lymphatic drainage (the shuttling of toxins out and away from cells so that more nutrients can travel in), and adds vitality to a dull complexion and lackluster hair,"" says Kimara Ahnert, owner of the eponymous skin-care studio in New York City. Here's how you can re-create a therapist's handiwork at home.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Face</b><br /><br /><br /><i>Why it helps:</i> Steady, rhythmic pressure in certain areas leads the blood to fully infuse the skin tissue, leaving it nourished and glowing, says Catherine Raubiet, education director for Lierac Paris. Rubbing upward can also prevent wrinkles and stop skin from sagging.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>How often to do it:</i> Every day, unless you have very sensitive skin or a condition like rosacea, which can become aggravated by too much fussing, says Raubiet.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>What to use:</i> A facial serum's long-lasting slickness can help avoid tugging on the fragile skin around your eyes. No serum on hand? Regular moisturizer is a worthy stand-in. For an extra treat, use a micro-massaging device like Clarisonic <i>($195, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.sephora.com"">sephora.com</a>)</i>.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>DIY:</i> ""Start with a generous amount of serum or moisturizer,"" says Silvana Mos, an aesthetician at the Kimara Ahnert Studio in Greenwich, Connecticut. Face your palms inward and hold them horizontally. With upward strokes, one hand quickly following the other, massage your cheeks and neck from left to right. Next, apply pressure with your middle fingers to the inner corners of your eyes and circle around the sockets three times. Then use your middle fingers to draw small heart shapes from left to right on your forehead. Finish by applying gentle, steady pressure on your temples with your middle and ring fingers.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Head and Scalp</b><br /><br /><br /><i>Why it helps:</i> Many women spend hours on their hair but totally neglect their scalp. Big mistake. ""The health and vitality of your scalp is the foundation of your hair's growth and health,"" says Elizabeth Cunnane-Phillips, a trichologist at the Philip Kingsley Trichological Centre in New York City. Massaging the scalp helps boost blood flow, which can reduce dandruff.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>How often to do it:</i> A few minutes of noggin kneading a day relaxes and revives your head, says Kenneth Milstead, lead aesthetician at Bliss 49 in New York City. If you have serious scalp irritation or eczema, stick to once a week.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>What to use:</i> Set down your brush and steer clear of those gimmicky scalp massagers, advises Cunnane-Phillips. While the little nibs on these items feel good, they can lead to tangles. Opt for a nonmechanical method, such as the Philip Kingsley Scalp Mask <i>($7, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.philipkingsley.com"">philipkingsley.com</a>)</i>, which has a menthol base to further enhance circulation and decrease flaking. If your hair isn't already wet, coat it with a rich conditioner before you start massaging. ""It will reduce the friction that can roughen up the cuticles and cause split ends,"" says Cunnane-Phillips.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>DIY:</i> Using all 10 fingers, start at your temples and gently but firmly massage your head in a circular motion. ""Don't scrub or rub the hair together-the process should be nearly silent to minimize damage,"" says Cunnane-Phillips. Continue working upward through the front of your hairline and then move back toward the crown, ending at the nape of your neck. Repeat three times for five minutes.<br /><br /></p>",

Sleep helps your brain consolidate information, so without that recovery time, you're unable to file away important data.<br /><br /><b>Your Waistline Expands </b><br />The importance of sleep is also true regarding weight. ""Some research has suggested that sleep restriction over many years may affect <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/daily-dose-august-18-boost-your-metabolism"">metabolism</a>, increasing the risk of obesity and type-2 diabetes,"" says Siobhan Banks, Ph.D., an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. In fact, a 2007 Canadian study found that people with a deprivation of sleep-those who get only 5 or 6 hours a night-increase their likelihood of being <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/americas-weight-problem"">overweight</a> by 69 percent, compared with those who habitually sleep 7 or 8 hours. <br /><b><br />You Get Sicker</b><br />University of Chicago researchers found that antibodies in sleep-deprived people who'd received a vaccine were about 50 percent weaker than those in well-rested people. Wake up early for that flu shot and it may not protect you so well. Harvard researchers also found that blood levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of heart-disease risk, can spike if you skip the sheets for just a few hours.<br /><br /><b>Your Cancer Risk Rises </b><br />During sleep your body produces melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate your sleep cycle. Interrupt sleepand you interrupt melatonin synthesis, which can be a problem. A 2007 University of Texas study review concluded that not only does melatonin detoxify harmful, cancer-causing free radicals, but in doing so it actually creates more antioxidants. Melatonin may also boost the effectiveness of vitamin C, another antioxidant.

Her difficulty finding clothes that fit made her feel uncomfortable and self-conscious, and the stay-at-home mom from Collegeville, Pennsylvania, hated that she never had energy to play with her two kids. In 2009, the scale hit a high of 211 pounds, and Jennifer, who is 5'2"", realized she weighed as much as her foot-taller husband. Curbing her sweet tooth and lacing up her running shoes helped the 31-year-old shed 85 pounds and get into the best shape of her life.<br /><br /><b>The Change</b><br />In early November 2009, while bingeing on her kids' leftover Halloween candy, Jennifer was suddenly flooded with guilt. ""I saw my out-of-control habits through their eyes and knew I needed to change,"" she says. She put down a handful of chocolate and vowed to stop her chaotic eating.<br /><br /><b>The Lifestyle</b><br />Logging calories in a food journal and weighing in every week kept Jennifer accountable for what she ate and helped her see when she'd overindulged. ""Before, if I wanted it, I ate it. I had no limits,"" she says. By April 2010, she was 25 pounds lighter, and she started walking every day to get into shape. She decided since walking to lose weight was good, <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/running-for-weightloss"">running to lose weight</a> would be even better. She gradually upped her distance and speed until she was running three miles a day. When she hit a plateau of 175 pounds in May, she broke it by adding weight-training DVDs to her routine. ""I used to be super self-conscious about my arms, but now they're toned and my favorite body part!"" she says. In August, Jennifer ran her first 5-K, and two months later she hit her goal weight.<br /><br /><b>The Reward</b><br />When she was overweight, Jennifer avoided going out, but now she thrives on outdoor activities such as running and hiking.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/how-to-cook-clams-lobster-and-more-seafood,Nutrition,9,41,2,18,1,93,0,0,,Cook Seafood: WH How To Guide,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0906-clams.jpg,"<b>Open-Air Clambake</b><br />Shellfish are not only crazy easy to grill but also loaded with disease-fighting <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/the-best-vitamins-for-women"">vitamins and nutrients</a> like vitamin D, selenium, B vitamins, and iron. To keep them tender and juicy, always cook them over super-high heat, says Steven Raichlen, author of <i>How to Grill</i> and host of the new PBS show <i>Primal Grill</i>. For smaller shellfish like shrimp and clams, you can keep the lid open, but for bigger catches like lobster, close it until it's time to flip or remove. Here's your guide on how to <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/sea-bass-recipe"">cook seafood</a> and making perfect grilled shellfish:<br /><br /><b>Clams</b> <br />Scrub the shells with a nylon brush to remove grit. Inspect the clams; toss any that are cracked or open. Wrap the clams loosely in a foil pouch with a drizzle of olive oil, a splash of white wine, fresh chopped garlic, and some fresh herbs, such as cilantro, parsley, or tarragon. <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/best-fish-for-the-environment"">Cook clams</a> for 5 minutes. When you unwrap the foil, the shells should be open. Toss any that aren't. <br /><br /><b>Lobster </b><br />When <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/delicious-shipped-foods"">cooking lobster </a>start at the head, and slit the entire live lobster lengthwise along its underbelly, reserving the juices. (Not into live sacrifice? Boil it for 5 minutes prior to cutting, or just use lobster tails.) Season the meat with olive oil. Place cut side on the grill for 2 to 3 minutes, then turn it onto its shell, pour reserved juices over meat, and grill until meat turns opaque (about 5 more minutes).<br /><br /><b>Mussels </b><br />If the mussels have silky threads at the hinges, remove them with needle-nose pliers so they don't catch fire. Scrub the shells, chucking any that are broken or don't shut when lightly tapped. Place directly on the grate with the rounder side down. Cook until the shells open (3 to 5 minutes). <br /><br /><b>Oysters</b> <br />After scrubbing to remove sand, shuck oysters and remove half the shell. Sprinkle meat with coarse sea salt or a dab of barbecue sauce. Grill with the shell side down until juices begin to bubble and the meat becomes firm (3 to 5 minutes).<br /><br /><b>Scallops</b> <br />Pat dry with a paper towel and thread scallops onto presoaked bamboo skewers. Brush with olive oil and season with lemon, salt, and pepper. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side-they should give a little when you touch them and be slightly brown on the surface. <br /><br /><b>Shrimp</b> <br />Cut the shell along the back with kitchen shears. Then, using a skewer or your fingers, find the dark veinlike thread and pull it out, leaving the shell in place. If the shrimp are small enough to fall through the grill grates, thread them onto skewers. Brush with oil and salt and pepper to taste and cook until the surface turns reddish-pink (2 to 4 minutes per side).<br /><br /><b>Fish feast</b> <br />Any dish from the deep tastes great on its own, but for a fantastic seafood medley, try this: In a disposable deep aluminum pan, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil with the grill set to high. Add diced onion, garlic, red pepper flakes, and parsley and sauté until the veggies start to brown. Add 2 cups of white wine and boil for 2 minutes. Lower heat to a simmer. Start grilling the shellfish-oysters, mussels, and clams first, then lobster, shrimp, and scallops. As each finishes, toss into the broth to simmer. Serve when everything has simmered for at least a minute.",You and Improved

""When you're under physical stress, your body releases hormones that clog up your lymph vessels in your overused muscles,"" explains John Douillard, M.D., director of LifeSpa, an ayurvedic clinic and retreat center in Boulder, Colorado. ""That's what's causing the <a href=""/yoga/yoga-to-beat-back-pain"">pain</a>."" Next time you're pushing your body to the limit, remember to stop and take several deep breaths, Douillard says. He suggests taking a break during hard-core endeavors and trying the breathing exercise (pranayama) detailed below. Once your muscles and energy are spent, relax with the other two soothing poses to help your body recover.</p><p><b>Ocean breath exercise (ujjayi breathing)</b></p><p><i>This exercise activates calming nerve receptors found only in the hard to reach lower lobes of the lungs. </i></p><p>First, practice breathing this way: Inhale once with your mouth open and exhale the same way, making a ""ha"" sound. Then close your mouth and make the same sound while inhaling and exhaling through your nose. You'll sound like the ocean or Darth Vader.</p><p>For this exercise, inhale fully through your nose. (The nose drives air through the nasal turbinates, which are engineered to get the air down to the lower lobes of the lungs.) Then exhale fully, contracting your throat slightly to make your breath audible. Keep your mouth closed. Repeat several times.</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/cow-face-pose""><b>Cow-face pose (gomukhasana)</b></a><b>, modified</b><br /><i>This pose helps protect the body from soreness and the <a href=""/yoga/yoga-to-ease-lower-back-pain"">lower back</a> from painful spasms. It releases tightness in the IT band, on the outer thigh, which helps protect the low back while opening the pelvis and the chest.<br /></i></p><p>Start by kneeling. Bring your left leg forward, wrapping it around your right knee toward the right hip as far as it will comfortably go. Then, spread your feet, drawing them forward and as wide apart as feels comfortable for you. Slowly sit back, placing your hips between both of your feet. Grab the top of your left knee and gently bring it toward your chest. Sit up and lift your chest open. Take deep breaths, breathing in and out through your nose. Hold this for about 3 minutes (longer if you're more advanced). Repeat, switching sides. </p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/sphinx-pose""><b>Sphinx pose (bhujangasana II)<br /></b></a><br /><i>For sore muscles in the low back region, one of the best yoga poses to follow cow-face pose (gomukhasana) is sphinx. You can hold this modified <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/cobra-pose-0"">cobra pose</a> longer than the full version. And that helps draw blood supply to the back, which allows the muscles to fully relax.</i></p><p>Lie face down with your feet turned in slightly and your elbows on the floor directly under your shoulders. Align your forearms parallel to each other, palms facing down, and fingers spread. From this position begin to lift your chest up by pressing down through your tailbone as you lift your head, then your chest off the floor, keeping your forearms on the floor. (Be sure to use your back muscles to pull yourself up instead of pushing up with your arms.) Breathe deeply, inhaling and exhaling through your nose.

She finds it more convincing to introduce naysayers to plant-based diets by way of their taste buds.<br /><br />In <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.thekinddietbook.com?cm_mmc=wh.com-_-editorial_contextual-_-site_link-_-the_kind_diet&keycode=207706""><i>The Kind Diet: A Simple Guide to Feeling Great, Losing Weight, and Saving the Planet</i></a>, now out in paperback, Alicia offers up 75 delicious meat-and dairy-free recipes. She also makes some pretty bold claims-specifically, that eating a plant-based diet rich in whole grains is a key to looking younger, losing weight, and feeling healthier. Judging from Alicia's sleek physique (she could still pass for her younger <i>Clueless</i> self), she may just be onto something.<br /><b><br />You say that adopting a plant-based diet ""released you from the prison of dieting."" How so? </b><br />I stopped the dieting thing 11 years ago when I went <a target=""_self"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-success-story-12"">vegan</a>-which I did for the animals. But magically, all this weight came off. Imagine that freedom! This diet is not about what you can't eat but finding food that's yummy and uplifts you. I never count calories, but I eat so well.<br /><br /><b>What's your advice to people who don't want to give up meat and dairy entirely?</b><br />That's exactly who the book is for. I know not everyone's going to go all the way, but I want people to know that making even a few changes does have an impact. They can start just by increasing the amount of whole grains they eat each day-like quinoa, wild rice, and couscous. Then you can do simple things-like, if you eat chicken and beef four times a week, cut down to just once a week at first. All of these choices can make a significant difference.<br /><br /><b>Are there any non-vegan foods that still tempt you?</b><br />When I see oysters or scallops at a restaurant I sometimes get a little, like, ""awwww."" But once I gave in and had a taste, and happily confirmed they're not better than anything I'm eating now. The thing I was really sad about when I went vegan was that I'd never have a chocolate peanut butter cup again [they're typically made with milk chocolate], but then I came up with my own amazing recipe [see below].<br /><br /><b><br />TRY THESE <i>THE KIND DIET</i> RECIPES</b><br /><br /><b>Alicia's Toasted Nori Burritos</b><br /><br />1 umeboshi plum<br />1 cup cooked brown rice (leftover is great)<br />2 sheets toasted nori<br />2 romaine lettuce leaves<br />1 avocado, sliced<br />1 apple, sliced<br />4 fresh basil leaves<br />Leaves from 6 cilantro sprigs<br />Leftover cooked kale or salad greens<br /><br />Tear the umeboshi plum into little pieces and discard the pit. Place half the rice on each sheet of nori and top with the remaining ingredients. Roll the nori into a cone shape around the filling; if it's rolled tightly, you can seal the edges by wetting your finger to dampen the edges of the nori.<br /><br />Note: Serve a half sheet of nori at dinner to use as a wrapper for any leftovers or food that might need refreshing. Nori makes everything taste great!<b><br /><br /></b><i>Serves 2</i><br /><b><br />Alicia's Chocolate Peanut Butter Cups</b><br /><br />1/2c Earth Balance natural spread (dairy-free butter)<br />3/4c crunchy peanut butter (preferably natural, unsweetened, and unsalted)<br />3/4c graham cracker crumbs or 10 graham cracker squares, crushed<br />1/4c maple sugar or other granulated sweetener<br />1c grain-sweetened nondairy chocolate or carob chips<br />1/4c soy, rice, or nut milk<br />1/4c chopped pecans, almonds, or peanuts<br /><br />Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.

I've sowed oats much wilder than those found in Kim Basinger's kitchen, doing the deed in public and making out with two siblings in one night -- and they were not brothers.<br /><br />But if these sexcapades are as contrived and silly as they sound, why do the experts keep recommending them? Do such simple suggestions have the power to send couples to their happy place faster than you can blurt out ""French maid costume""? WH wanted to find out, so they sent me on a sex-charged adventure to test five intriguing but possibly overrated scenarios and report back which ones are worth trying -- and which you should ditch faster than a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/sex-toy-or-household-object-quiz"">vibrator</a> with dead batteries.<br /><br /><b>Scenario #1 Do it double-blind</b><br /><br />The last time I closed my eyes for too long during <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/relationship-tips"">sex</a>, I set fire to a pillow, leaving me with the knowledge that a Brita pitcher is not a good fire extinguisher. So I was hesitant about both me and my husband wearing blindfolds. But I bit the bullet and bought a pretty pink satin number for myself and a manly black one for my masked avenger (Pipedream Satin Love Mask, $8, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://amazon.com"">amazon.com</a>).<br /><br /><b>We started in the living room. But moving to the bedroom proved more challenging</b>. I began breaststroking through the air like a charades player miming ""blind Captain Nemo"" until Dan took the lead and we landed on the bed, fumbling with our clothes. <b>I headed south, arriving at what I thought was my Marco's polo but was actually his thigh.</b> He reoriented me by planting my mouth at his navel. But I felt disconnected. Only when we kissed did the act feel familiar again. Then Dan sighed, ""Oh, I wish I could see you."" Way to make a girl feel good!<br /><br /><b>Lust or bust?</b> The novelty quickly wore off and left me craving that visual connection. But once we tossed the blindfolds, the sex was fun, fast, and furious.<br /><br /><b>Scenario #2 Meet my man in a bar and pretend to be strangers</b><br /><br />I arranged for Dan to meet me at a lounge up the street from our condo at 11 p.m. so we could play ""strangers in the night."" At 9 p.m., I joined some girlfriends at a wine bar to down a whole lotta Riesling -- <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/what-you-should-know-about-alcohol"">liquid courage</a> necessary before I could don...The Wig. Unbeknownst to Dan, I'd decided to take our role playing to the next level and show up in a cascade of chest-length, sunshiny waves and tousled bangs (versus my normally pin-straight, dark blonde ponytail).<br /><br /><b>The key to picking up your partner at a bar is playing it cool so as not to ruin the mood.</b> But upon spotting my mark through the haze of hair, I was so drunkenly excited for him to see me in all my Shakira-like glory that I stiletto-jogged over and lunged for his lips, all 6 feet of me nearly tripping over the barstool next to him. A party next to us tittered, and I realized they probably thought that, with my Amazonian height and Barbarella wig, I was a hooker or a transvestite.<br /><br />Dan, poker face firm, extended his hand.<br /><br />""Do I know you? My name's Billy.""<br /><br />Billy, I learned, had founded a nonprofit to save abandoned puppies. I was Candy, a manicurist.<br /><br /><b>We bantered back and forth for a while, painstakingly staying in character. It was frigging exhausting.</b><br /><br />An hour in, we broke character and I admitted a dire craving for French fries. We hit the Hoagie Hut, then went home. I used up what little energy I had left climbing the stairs.<br /><br /><b>Lust or bust?</b> Wearing such a dramatic wig was a blast, but as for the role-playing, it was too cliché -- and so tiring we didn't even end up having sex.<br /><br /><b>Scenario #3 Put Tantra to the test</b><br /><br />I prepared for our Tantric tête-à-tête by reading <i>The Essence of Tantric Sexuality </i>($12, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://amazon.com"">amazon.com</a>). Authors Patricia Johnson and Mark A. Michaels liken the typical orgasm to a ""genital sneeze."" But there has to be more to great sex than ""God bless you!"" and a Kleenex.<br /><br />With my vagina (or ""yoni"") ready for enlightenment, I read aloud to Dan about ""an altered state of consciousness,"" one achieved by prolonging the excitement phase of sex, leading to a strong orgasm with or without ejaculation.<br /><br />In bed, we assumed Tantra's classic female-superior ""Yab Yum"" position (seated with legs wrapped around each other). <b> seemed distracted, but I assumed he was concentrating on flowing energy from his ""lingam"" into my yoni.</b> We rocked back and forth. We breathed deeply. We spoke with our eyes. His cried, ""I've had chronic back pain for 3 years -- this is killing me!"" And with that, he literally tossed me aside like a rag doll so he could execute a full-body stretch.<br /><br /><b>Lust or bust?</b> A few nights later, we found ourselves Yab Yumming again (this time with a pillow behind Dan for lumbar support). And while we didn't have 6-hour sex, our foray left our ""genital noses"" itching, so we ended with a good old Western <i>ahchoo</i>.<br /><br /><b>Scenario #4 Surprise mortgage broker hubby at his office dressed in just a trench coat and heels</b><br /><br />This might work in balmy San Diego. But I live in Chicago, and the day I prepared to strip down to my birthday suit and slip into an unlined khaki trench, the newspaper headlines read, ""Cold Delays Flights, Cracks Water Pipes."" Holy crap!<b> If the minus-20-degree windchill could reroute 747s and make metal pipes burst, what would it do to my sensitive little flower?</b><br /><br />Putting on a brave face, I undressed, goose bumps dotting my arms and legs even inside our 72-degree condo. Outside, as the wind whipped furiously, I heard a soft whimpering sound and realized it was my poor Brazilian-coiffed yoni crying for a reprieve. ""It's okay,"" I whispered, turning back toward the door. ""We'll try again in the summer."" Because when your clitoris gets frostbite, the terrorists win.<br /><br /><b>Lust or bust?</b> I can't wait to try again during the next heat wave. Weather permitting, I'd probably give it<br /><br /><b>Scenario #5 Wear a pearl thong for a day</b><br /><br />The last time a semiprecious stone came this close to my nethers, it was on a hand holding a speculum. Yet I was oddly excited when I opened my K. Bella Pearl and Lace Thong ($58, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://kbella.com"">kbella.com</a>). <b>I ran my fingers along the smooth, pinkish white strand attached to a black stretch lace waistband, wondering how something that looked so nice around a neck could be so naughty -- not to mention tacky -- down below.</b><br /><br />As I pulled it on the next morning, here's how I envisioned my day:<br /><br />Walking to the bus: Orgasm #1<br /><br />Crossing my legs at my desk: Orgasm #2<br /><br />Afternoon Starbucks break: Orgasm #3 (Grande)<br /><br />Thirty minutes on the elliptical: Priceless<br /><br />In reality, my day was completely normal. The strand was mostly unnoticeable and only occasionally rubbed me the wrong way. I tried tugging on it when nobody was looking but felt pervy.<br /><br />Then At my gym that evening, a stability ball led to unexpected pleasures. One crunch, two crunch, three crunch, whoa! There I was, climaxing in the stretching area next to an old man doing biceps curls. More crunches yielded still more bouncing bliss.<br /><br /><b>Lust or bust?</b> Sure it took all day, but it was totally worth the wait.

Most likely, she has a Maserati-fast metabolism that incinerates fat before it has a chance to take up residence on her thighs.<br /><br /><br /><br />Jealous? Don't be. While genetics counts for part of your metabolic efficiency, you can give Mother Nature a kick in the pants by simply tweaking your fitness regimen. ""Your body adapts to exercise over time, which causes your metabolism to fall into a lull,"" says Geoff Bagshaw, group fitness manager at the Equinox fitness club in Miami. ""Adding variety to your workouts will help you break through plateaus so you continue to see results.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Intensity matters too: Exercising harder promotes the growth of lean muscle, which burns more calories during and after your workout, says Craig Ballantyne, owner of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.turbulencetraining.com"">TurbulenceTraining.com</a>. The three strength-training techniques on these pages will inject a powerful double shot of variety and intensity into your usual routine. Replace one of your regular workouts each week with one of these <a href=""/fitness/workouts"">fitness workouts</a> and watch those extra pounds melt away<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>CONTRAST TRAINING</b><br /><br /><br />This technique involves doing a resistance exercise with weights, and then immediately following it with an explosive body-weight exercise that works the same muscle group. ""In contrast training, the movement pattern of the second exercise should always mimic the first one,"" says sports performance specialist Barry Lovelace, owner of FitQuest Fitness in Allentown, Pennsylvania. In other words, chest presses should be followed by explosive pushups, or dumbbell squats followed by squat jumps.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Fat-trimming trick:</b> Busting out an explosive move after a strength move trains your body to recruit more muscle fibers. Researchers at the University of California at Santa Cruz found that this type of workout (also called concurrent training) increases lean muscle mass while it decreases body-fat percentage.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Try It:</b> Hold a 10-to 20-pound dumbbell in each hand, stand with your feet hip-width apart, and lower into a squat (as if you're sitting into a chair) for five to 10 reps. Then ditch the dumbbells and do five to 10 jump squats: Lower into a squat, then push through your heels to jump off the ground; land softly and immediately lower into another rep. Rest for one to three minutes, then repeat the sequence, working your way up to five or six sets.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>PYRAMID METHOD</b><br /><br /><br />You'll do three or more sets of the same exercise, starting with light resistance and high reps, then increasing the weight and decreasing the reps with each set. A full workout of pyramid sets can be tough (and time consuming), so start by working one upper-body and one lower-body exercise into the end of your workout, says Ballantyne. This way, you won't exhaust the key muscle groups you need to complete your regular routine.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Fat-trimming trick:</b> Unlike other intense workouts that build strength, this technique emphasizes muscular endurance (the rate at which your body can continually produce force), which can increase your fat-burning rate.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Try It:</b> Holding a pair of dumbbells at your sides, step forward with your right foot and lower your body until your right knee is bent 90 degrees. Return to standing, and continue for a total of 15 reps. Repeat with the left leg, then rest for 20 seconds before doing the second set: 10 to 12 reps, using a slightly heavier weight. Rest, then increase the weight again and do six to eight reps.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>TABATA METHOD</b><br /><br /><br />Fast-and-furious intervals-20 seconds of all-out effort followed by 10 seconds of rest-are repeated a total of eight times (for a grand total of four minutes). Researchers at McMaster University in Ontario found that exercising as hard as you can for short periods of time is as effective at improving muscle and metabolism as sweating it out longer at a lower intensity.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Fat-trimming trick:</b> All-out effort keeps your heart rate zipping for the entire workout (even during the rests) and for hours after you kick off your sneakers. The end result? You burn extra calories.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Try It:</b> Bagshaw suggests this three-move sequence: Starting with exercise one, do as many reps as you can with proper form in 20 seconds, rest for 10 seconds, then continue for a total of eight intervals. Rest for two minutes, then go to exercise two and do eight intervals. Take another two-minute breather, then do eight intervals of exercise three.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>1/ Lunges with biceps curls:</b> Holding dumbbells at your sides, step back and lower into a lunge, curling the weights up to your shoulders. Stand and repeat, alternating legs.<br /><br /><br /><b>2/ Squats with overhead presses:</b> Hold dumbbells at shoulder height and lower into a squat. Press the dumbbells directly overhead as you stand.<br /><br /><br /><b>3/ Pushups:</b> From a pushup position (or modified pushup position, with your knees on the ground), bend your elbows to lower your chest to the floor.<br /><br /></p>",

Just ask Regina Gunn, winner of our Fittest Friends contest on Facebook back in 2011. As a certified personal trainer and owner of Gunn's Fitness in Matthews, North Carolina, Gunn is constantly motivating her clients to get fit and achieve their goals. Check out some of her best fitness secrets for amazing results:<p></p><p><strong>Take in the Right Fuel</strong><br />It's not enough to overhaul your gym routine-you need to make changes in the kitchen, too. ""I honestly believe that nutrition is 80 percent of it,"" says Gunn. ""If you don't eat properly you're not going to see the results that you want to see."" </p> <p><strong>Choose Workouts that Work Harder</strong><br />You don't have to spend hours at the gym to get in a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/tags/total-body-workouts"">total body workout</a>-just opt for interval or circuit training. ""Whether you're on a treadmill, running outside, biking, or lifting weights, interval training is the way to go,"" says Gunn. How it works: You do something to get your heart rate way up, then your body works harder to bring it back down, meaning you'll burn more calories. Circuit training is another one of her favorites. ""Any kind of cardio in between a strength training exercise,"" says Gunn. ""You can do that for 45 minutes or an hour and then you're done. You don't have to lift for an hour and then do cardio."" </p><p><strong>Make it Personal</strong><br />It can seem daunting (and expensive) to get a personal trainer, but it's often the best way to maximize your workout. ""You need to educate yourself on what to do and how to do it correctly, because every body is different,"" says Gunn. She suggests finding a nationally certified personal trainer in your area and trying it out for even just a month. If you think you're motivated enough to do it on your own, you can take what you've learned and go solo.</p> <p><strong>Give Yourself Days Off </strong><br />""Resting is extremely important, because that's when your muscles repair,"" says Gunn. ""You don't want to get burnt out either, because then you're going to give up and not want to go back to it."" Make sure to take at least one day off from your workout, and if you need extra rest days you can always swap in some yoga. ""Adding yoga into a workout regimen is good for your mind, body, and soul."" </p><p><strong>Use the Buddy System</strong><br /> Her biggest motivation tip: ""Find an accountability partner,"" says Gunn. ""You keep each other motivated and a lot of times personal trainers will give discounts to groups."" Plus, you'll have someone to celebrate with when you meet those fitness goals. </p><p><strong>Make a Quickie Count</strong><br /> Don't let a busy schedule get in your way of fitness. Gunn's solution: Get up thirty minutes earlier and do super tough <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/tags/quick-workouts"">quick workouts</a>. If you're running low on time, it's fine to cut a workout down to a half hour (or even less!) if you keep the intensity high the whole time, says Gunn. And knowing you can still squeeze in a good workout in thirty minutes means you're less likely to skip the gym altogether just because you're running late.</p> ",

""Also, it makes the leather more supple-almost like 'breaking them in.'"" </p><p>Once you've identified your hot spots, preemptively slather on a slicking solution that can bulletproof the area. It feels like lotion but acts like wax. ""The solution covers your skin with a light film that acts as a barrier between your skin and the shoe,"" says Weisenfeld. It won't help you after you have a blister, but if you reapply whenever you start to feel irritation, you can keep one from popping up. </p><p>Try Dr. Scholl's For Her Miracle Shield, $6.99, <a href=""http://drscholls.com/drscholls/index.jsp"">drscholls.com</a>.

To sterilize, wash needle with soapy water, dry and rub down with alcohol. Make sure to leave the roof of the blister intact and never cut skin that hurts when you pierce it (dead skin-like the tops of blisters-won't hurt, but healthy skin will). </p><p>Apply an antiseptic or antibiotic cream and cover with gauze and moleskin.

Don't Worry,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0511-chocolate-0473.jpg,"Who says<a href=""http://recipes.womenshealthmag.com/homepage.aspx""> health food </a>has to be boring? Study after study proves that chocolate - sweet, rich, and delicious - is good for more than curing a broken heart. The secret behind its powerful punch is cacao, also the source of the sweet's distinct taste. Packed with healthy chemicals like flavonoids and theobromine, this little bean is a disease-killing bullet. The only problem? Cacao on its own is bitter, chalky, nasty stuff. Enter milk, sugar, and butter - good for your taste buds, not always good for your health. Besides adding calories, these can dilute the benefits of cacao. So snack smart: Stick to <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/eating-green-tea"">healthy chocolate</a> with at least 70 percent cacao (or cocoa, which is cacao in its roasted, ground form). As long as the content is that high, says Mary Engler, Ph.D., a professor of physiological nursing at the University of California at San Francisco, you can reap the benefits from eating only small amounts. (Because of its high fat and sugar content, limit yourself to 7 ounces, or about four dark chocolate bars, a week.) Besides nixing that achin' heart, here are four more things that will go down easy when you have that <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/stop-food-cravings"">chocolate craving</a>.<br /><br /><b>Gives You: A Healthier Heart</b> <br />Studies prove that chocolate reduces blood pressure, increases the flexibility of veins and arteries, and cuts down on strokeand heart attack risk. Most of the credit goes to flavonoids, which kill off free radicals, the unstable cells that antioxidants fight. New research from the University of Athens, however, suggests that flavonoids may be only part of chocolate's heart-helping properties. The scientists plan more research to discover what those properties are (and, no, they aren't accepting volunteers). <br /><br /><b>TASTES BETTER THAN An apple, which has just 20 percent of the flavonoids of a bar.</b><br /><br /><b>Gives You: A Quelled Cough</b> <br />One study found that chocolate quieted coughs almost as well as codeine, thanks to the theobromine it contains. This chemical, responsible for chocolate's feel-good effect, may suppress activity in a part of the brain called the vagus nerve. Maria Belvisi, a professor of respiratory pharmacology at the National Heart and Lung Institute in London, says, ""It had none of the negative side effects."" <br /><br /><b>TASTES BETTER THANCodeine, which can leave you sleepy and dull.</b><br /><br /><b>Gives You: Happier Kids</b><br />Moms who ate chocolate daily during their pregnancy reported that they were better able to handle stress than moms who abstained. Also, their babies were happier and smiled more, a Finnish study found. <br /><br /><b>TASTES BETTER THAN Chewing on your screaming baby's pacifier. </b><br /><br /><b>Gives You: A Guard Against Diabetes</b> <br />Candy as a diabetes foe? Sure enough. In a small Italian study, participants who ate a candy bar's worth of dark chocolate once a day for 15 days saw their potential for insulin resistance drop by nearly half. ""Flavonoids increase nitric oxide production,"" says lead researcher Claudio Ferri, M.D., a professor at the University of L'Aquila in Italy. ""And that helps control insulin sensitivity."" <br /><br /><b>TASTES BETTER THAN Cherries, which have just 18 percent of the flavonoids.</b><br />",healthy eating

What the hell was Mother Nature thinking?<br /><br />That's what evolutionary biologists have been trying to figure out - with little success. <i>The Case of the Female Orgasm: Bias in the Science of Evolution</i> by Elisabeth Lloyd, Ph.D., a biology professor at Indiana University, shoots holes in virtually every theory that has ever attempted to pinpoint an evolutionary purpose to the female climax. ""The clitoris has the indispensable function of promotingsexual excitement,which induces the female to have intercourse and become pregnant,"" Dr. Lloyd says. ""But the actual incidence of the reflex of orgasm has never been tied to successful reproduction."" Translation: Because women can and do get pregnant without climaxing, scientists can't figure out why we orgasm at all.<br /><br />The good news is that most scientists do agree on the how. Here's what they know, so far - and how that knowledge can help the average girl hit her peak more often. Because even if the female orgasm does turn out to be pointless in terms of sustaining the species, it still feels pretty damn good.<br /><br /><br /><b>While You Were Blissing Out...</b><br /><br />When in the throes of an orgasm, you wouldn't notice if your dog, your cat, and your cockatiel started rearranging the furniture. Which makes it unlikely that you could track all the subtle changes that are happening in your body. Luckily, famous sex researchers William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson have done it for you in their seminal work, Human Sexuality. Here's what they found:<br /><br />That warm, sexy rush you feel during foreplay is the result of blood heading straight to your <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/vagina-information"">vagina</a> and clitoris. Around this time, the walls of the vagina start to secrete beads of lubrication that eventually get bigger and flow together.<br /><br />As you become more turned on, blood continues to flood the pelvic area, breathing speeds up, heart rate increases, nipples become erect, and the lower part of the vagina narrows in order to grip the penis while the upper part expands to give it someplace to go. If all goes well (i.e., the phone doesn't ring and your partner knows what he's doing), an incredible amount of nerve and muscle tension builds up in the genitals, pelvis, buttocks, and thighs - until your body involuntarily releases it all at once in a series of intensely pleasurable waves, aka your orgasm.<br /><br />The big bang is the moment when the uterus, vagina, and anus contract simultaneously at 0.8-second intervals. A small orgasm may consist of three to five contractions; a biggie, 10 to 15. Many women report feeling different kinds of orgasms - clitoral, vaginal, and many combinations of the two. According to Beverly Whipple, Ph.D., coauthor of <i>The G-Spot and Other Discoveries About Human Sexuality</i>, the reason may simply be that different parts of the vagina were stimulated more than others, and so have more tension to release. Also, muscles in other parts of the body may contract involuntarily - hence the clenched toes and goofy faces. As for the brain, a recent small-scale study at the Netherlands' University of Groningen found that areas involving fear and emotion are actually deactivated during orgasm (not so if you fake it).<br /><br />After the peak of pleasure, the body usually slides into a state of satisfied relaxation - but not always. ""Like their male counterparts, women can experience pelvic heaviness and aching if they do not reach orgasm,"" says Ian Kerner, Ph.D., a certified sex therapist and author of <i>She Comes First: The Thinking Man's Guide to Pleasuring a Woman</i>. In fact, Dr. Kerner says, ""many women complain that a single orgasm isn't enough to relieve the buildup of sexual tension,"" which can leave us with our own ""blue balls."" Don't worry: Like the male version, it's harmless.<br /><br /><b>Big ""O"" Blockers</b><br /><br />So what goes wrong on those nights when the fuse gets lit but the bomb never explodes? ""Nine times out of 10 it's because [the woman isn't] getting enough continuous clitoral stimulation,"" Dr. Kerner says. Often, ""A woman will get close to orgasm, her partner picks up on it, and [then he either] orgasms immediately or changes what he was doing.""<br /><br />That's why Dr. Kerner frequently recommends the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/the-best-sex-position"">woman-on-top position.</a> Because you control the angle and speed of the thrusts (try a back-and-forth motion so that your clitoris rubs against your partner's abdomen), it allows for the most constant clitoral stimulation. Another solution is to find a position that mimics <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/masturbation-1"">how you masturbate.</a> If you have solo sex by lying on your belly and rubbing your clitoris with your hands tucked beneath you, then your man can enter you from behind in that position. By watching you he'll also get a better sense of the stimulation you need.<br /><br />""Spectatoring"" is another problem that can trip women up. ""It's when a woman is too concerned with her appearance and/or performance to actually enjoy herself,"" Dr. Kerner says. There's no way you're going to have an orgasm if you're fretting about your cellulite or stressing over whether your newest as-seen-on-late-night-cable moves feel good for him. Instead, you have to let the erotic sensations register in your mind. Focus. Breathe. Let go. ""It may seem counterintuitive,"" he says, ""but you need to relax to build sexual tension.""<br /><br />The best preparation for a big orgasm is probably a long, steamy shower, full-body massages by and for your man - or 10 minutes of steady oral sex, if you can get it. It's not so much your body that needs the R&R as your mind. ""Many women need a transition period between dealing with the stress of everyday life and feeling sexual,"" Dr. Kerner says. ""A few minutes of foreplay usually isn't enough."" Doing something ritualistic and soothing that will clear your head of to-do lists, work issues, family problems, and whatever else might be distracting you from connecting with your body is essential to feeling ecstatic.<br /><br /><b>A Hormone Worth Getting Excited About</b><br /><br />The most fascinating orgasmic sideeffect of all happens in the brain. During the big moment, the hypothalamus releases extra oxytocin into your system. Called the ""cuddle hormone,"" oxytocin has been correlated with the urge to bond, be affectionate, and protect (new moms are drunk on the stuff). Since an increase in oxytocin has been shown to strengthen the uterine contractions that transport sperm to the egg, those findings are giving evolutionary biologists new hope. According to Dr. Lloyd, it's conceivable that the additional oxytocin gives enough of a boost to contractions that orgasm could play a part in conception after all. ""Of all the avenues of orgasm research, I think the oxytocin avenue is the most promising,"" she says. It's even been hypothesized that having an orgasm and releasing that tide of oxytocin is a woman's subconscious way of approving of her partner as a potential dad.<br /><br />The latest news is that this cuddle hormone might also be linked to our ability to trust. In a recent study at the University of Zurich, scientists asked 178 male college students to play an investment game with a partner they'd never met. Half of the students used an oxytocin nasal spray (not yet available in the United States) beforehand; half used a placebo. Those with the spray containing oxytocin were more than twice as likely to feel comfortable giving all of their money to their anonymous (but legitimate) partner. If oxytocin can help women feel more at ease about letting go and intensify orgasmic contractions, we might all want a bottle of the stuff stashed in our bedside drawers someday soon.<br />",orgasm

Operating on different time zones.</b> Everyone has a different internal clock. On vacation, it's important to match up activities with times when you have the stamina to do them. Ask yourself: Which time of day is each of your high focus times? Do you thrive before noon? Does he need an afternoon nap? Do you like to sleep late and party till dawn? Does he turn into a pumpkin at midnight? Talk about what will be the most refreshing for you both and plan ahead so you both get what you need. </p><p><b>2. Disagreeing on what to eat.</b> How many times will you have fine dining? Will you picnic? What is your ideal? His? Plan for specific things and leave the rest to the natural unfolding of the vacation. Sharing your expectations will make adjusting easier on the trip.</p><p><b>3. Shopping.</b> Opposite shopping styles can be frustrating to all. If you are a browser and he is a buyer, it is definitely a problem. Minimize the amount of time that you spend doing incongruous activities; while it's good to be together, if your browsing makes him grumpy, perhaps you can speed things up and take an afternoon alone to really ""get your browse on"" while he does something more to his liking.</p><p><b>4. You want wine; he wants coffee.</b> What do you expect in terms of drinking and other indulgent behaviors? If your idea of a trip is wine with dinner and his is a cocktail poolside at noon, you could have a problem. When it comes to a vacation, you want to try and be on the same page related to indulgences and knowing ahead of time what his expectations are will help you to manage yours.</p><p><b>5. Mood swings.</b> Irritability in even the most loving couples can run high when traveling, due to extra stress and confined areas-car, train, stateroom or plane. Arrange for some alone time every day so you can, literally, get some space. </p><p><b>6. Disrupted sleep.</b> If one of you is a snorer or you are used to sleeping separately, sleep arrangements should be thought out in advance, especially if your trip spans more than two nights. Arguments over the expense of hotel rooms are common, but remember that sleep deprivation can breed nastiness. Make sure you don't sacrifice too much nighttime comfort to save a few bucks-it will backfire ten-fold and won't be worth it. If your honey starts snapping at you due to sleep issues, be compassionate. If two separate beds and earplugs or a white noise machine won't handle the issue, book a suite if you can manage it. </p><p><a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.yourtango.com/experts/10-red-flags-look-out-when-traveling-couple/page/2"">4 More Secrets to a Successful Getaway: Read them on YourTango.com</a></p><p><b>More from YourTango.com:</b><br /><a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.yourtango.com/201177549/10-best-wedding-planning-books-and-websites"">The 10 Best Wedding Planning Books and Websites</a><br /> <a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.yourtango.com/201177953/long-commute-can-ruin-your-marriage"">The Truth About Sexual Chemistry</a><br /><br /></p>",travel
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/male-infertility,Health,25,32,14,38,1,0,6,0,,Infertility in Men: Are His Swimmers Stuck?,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1107-his-swimmers.jpg,"<p>Men like to boast about their virility, but many don't think about how to protect their baby-making power. They just assume that when the time comes, they'll step up to the plate and hit a home run with their bat. Big mistake. According to new research, one in five guys ages 18 to 25 is ""subfertile,"" and fertility rates among men of all ages have been dropping steadily for the past 60 years. So what qualifies as male subfertility, exactly?</p><p>His testes produce too few sperm. (Fifteen to 20 million sperm per milliliter of semen is considered normal.)</p><p>A big percentage of his boys move slowly or not at all.</p><p>A bunch of his sperm are misshapen. For maximum fertility, more than 4 percent of sperm at any given time should be physically perfect.<br /></p><p><b>Modern-Day Dilemma</b><br />""Many of the things that make our lives easier may be affecting sperm production and vitality,"" says urologist Jeanne O'Brien, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical Center. Chemicals like phthalates (used to make plastic items durable), parabens (the preservatives in grooming products), and pesticides can interfere with sperm, leaving a man with too few or a whole lot of damaged ones. Certain UV filters in sunscreens, as well as additives fed to livestock, can also curb a guy's fertility. ""Even birth-control pills may be having an effect,"" says Marc Goldstein, M.D., surgeon-in-chief at the Cornell Institute for Reproductive Medicine. Most filters can't catch the Pill hormones that women pee out, allowing them to seep back into the water supply.</p><p>The majority of the above chemicals are endocrine disrupters, or xenoestrogens, substances that mimic the female sex hormone estrogen and interfere with a body's normal balance of androgens, the messengers between the brain and the reproductive system. Normally, a man has small amounts of estrogen in his body, but too much of the stuff can kill sperm cells. (Most of these chemicals aren't great for women either, but men are particularly sensitive to too much estrogen.)</p><p>Sadly, some of the havoc wreaked by xenoestrogens can take place even before a man is born. Exposure in utero to phthalates, pesticides, and preservatives may lead to a lower sperm count, says O'Brien. What's more, studies show that fetus testicles exposed to endocrine disrupters can develop abnormally, a growing problem known as testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS). Because it causes defects in a man's reproductive tract, TDS has been linked to testicular cancer and-you guessed it-subfertility. It's one reason so many men are experiencing issues at such a young age.<br /></p><p><b>The Party in His Pants</b><br />Acting like a cast member of <i>The Hangover</i> may seem fun, but smoking (cigarettes or pot) and excessive drinking are tantamount to spermicide. ""The active ingredient in marijuana binds to estrogen receptors in the testicles,"" says Goldstein. As a result, pot smokers often have defective sperm that can't hang on to an egg long enough to fertilize it. (While occasional tokers compromise their short-term fertility, long-term partyers may become permanently subfertile.) Similarly, booze puts the kibosh on the body's absorption of zinc, a mineral needed to form strong sperm.</p><p>Another way a dude may decrease his potency? By heating things up. ""There is a reason the testicles hang outside the body,"" says Goldstein. ""They need to maintain a slightly lower temperature in order to manufacture sperm."" Frequent hot-tub or sauna sessions can crank up scrotal temperatures and interfere with sperm production. And early research shows that if a guy keeps his cell phone in his front pocket, or props a laptop or iPad on his lap, he could be raising his testicular temperature by more than two degrees. Some doctors go so far as to suggest that patients switch from tighty-whities to boxers and avoid crossing their legs in order to keep their coconuts cool, though no studies prove either is a big risk.</p><p>Packing on excessive body fat has also been linked to elevated estrogen levels-and, therefore, to subfertility. (Doctors say it's best for men to maintain a BMI of 30 or under.) Stress, too, may cancel out the hormones that help a man produce healthy sperm.</p><p>But while experts continue to study the particulars, there is ample evidence that lifestyle adjustments can help a guy score physically perfect swimmers, says David Tourgeman, M.D., a fertility physician in Los Angeles. And male subfertility is often reversible, sometimes in as few as three months. ""The life cycle of sperm is 54 to 72 days,"" says O'Brien, ""so if a man stops sperm-damaging behavior, he has a good chance of turning things around.""<br /><br /><br /></p>",

Most treatment plants dose tap water with chlorine to kill things like parasites and viruses found naturally in freshwater sources.</p><p>Harmful effects In small doses, chlorine is literally a lifesaver: It zaps dangerous contaminants. But studies show that long-term exposure to chlorine by-products can lead to miscarriage or birth defects, says Gina Solomon, M.D., a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p><p>Your action plan Chlorine by-products evaporate naturally, so let your glass of tap sit for five minutes before drinking it. Another option: Buy an inexpensive charcoal filter (a freestanding pitcher, a faucet attachment, or a built-in fridge device).</p><p><strong>Lead</strong><br />How'd it get in there? Water facilities strip out nearly all traces of the heavy metal, but if you live in a home built before 1975, chances are you have pipes that contain lead, which can leach into your water.</p><p>Harmful effects Even a small amount is bad news; lead can trigger irritability, anemia, and nerve damage. Women trying to conceive should be especially careful: Lead poisoning can cause <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/conditions/miscarriage"">miscarriage</a> and a host of fetal problems.</p><p>Your action plan Lead can seep into water that's been sitting stagnant in pipes, ""so run your tap for two minutes to flush it out,"" says James M. Symons, M.D., author of <em>Plain Talk About Drinking Water</em>. (Rather than waste that water, use it to wash your hands or the dishes.)</p><p><strong>Bacteria</strong><br />How'd they get in there? Gnarly bacteria like E. coli can make their way into water from human and animal waste that runs into reservoirs from broken pipes and sewage systems.</p><p>Harmful effects ""Just a tiny bit of bacteria can make you sick,"" says Suzanne R. Steinbaum, D.O., an internist in New York City. The last time you had a ""24-hour stomach bug,"" it was likely caused by waterborne bacteria. Most people recover quickly, but pregnant women can be laid up for days.</p><p>Your action plan Purifiers nix most bacteria. But if your immune system is compromised, first boil your water for five minutes.</p><p><strong>Hormones and Drug By-Products</strong><br />How'd they get in there? Every time you pop a pill-whether it's a Tylenol or Xanax- traces of it come out in your pee. And (ick alert!) that urine can eventually find its way back into our tap water. Scientists haven't yet figured out how to remove most drug by-products from water.</p><p>Harmful effects ""Traces of things like aspirin probably aren't a big deal,"" says Solomon. However, the presence of prescription drugs ""may contribute to the growth of antibiotic-resistant illnesses like MRSA, and hormones from meds like birth-control pills could be affecting pregnant women and their babies in ways we don't know yet.""</p><p>Your action plan Filters are fairly useless against drug residuals. So for now, just sit tight: The Environmental Protection Agency is assessing what regulatory action to take.</p>",

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/health-reform-law,Health,31,32,28,23,0,0,11,0,,"Birth Control: Your Rights, Right Now",http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1104-planned-parenthood.jpg,"<p><b>Q: Health-care reform is under fire. What are some significant changes women will see if the new policies stick?</b><br />As complicated and imperfect as the process was, it was the biggest increase in health-care coverage for women and their families that they will ever see in their lifetimes. It is historic. Getting rid of insurance bias for preexisting conditions is huge. Being a victim of domestic violence, having a cesarean section, or being pregnant are no longer reasons to deny someone insurance coverage, and in the past they have been.</p><p><b>Q: What will the impact be on a woman's basic health-care needs?</b><br />It will be tremendous. One of the most exciting things is that under the women's healthcare amendment put forth by Senator Barbara Mikulski, further preventive care will be available without co-pay; the Department of Health and Human Services is now deciding what this will include. Lots will be covered under this, including mammograms.</p><p><b>Q: Will birth control be covered without co-pay?</b><br />This is a major issue that's yet to be decided. But if <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/birth-control"">birth control</a> is covered, it will become radically more accessible. A lot of women choose a particular contraceptive because it's cheap, not because it's effective. Women who get pregnant unintentionally usually do so because they ran out of pills, forgot to take them, or didn't like the way the pills made them feel so they decided not to take them anymore, not realizing that there are many kinds of pills. And the Pill is not supposed to make them break out in pimples or feel sick or bloated.</p><p><b>Q: How will coverage affect women's choices?</b><br />Women will start to decide what works best for them rather than [automatically] going on the Pill just because that's all they know about or can afford. Long-term contraceptives like an IUD, which can work for up to 12 years, have higher up-front costs-between $500 and $1,000-but they are less expensive over the long haul. [The initial cost] can be a disincentive for some women, even though an IUD is more effective at preventing unwanted pregnancies than any other reversible method currently available.</p><p>You can talk to any women-on the bus, at the park, at the grocery store-and when they learn that birth control might be covered with no co-pay, they immediately get the difference it will make for them. It's an economic difference.</p><p><b>Q: Will better birth-control options mean fewer abortions?</b><br />Yes! Nearly half of all pregnancies in this country are unintended, and 42 percent of those-that's 1.3 million pregnancies a year-are terminated by abortion. The United States leads the Western world in numbers of unintended pregnancies and abortions.</p><p>The investment we make as a country in birth control will save so much in unintended-pregnancy costs-emotional and financial-later on, and it will lower the number of abortions. Covering birth control without co-pay is great health-care policy. The medical profession supports it. The public supports it. Science supports it. This is a trifecta that you rarely have.</p><p><b>Q: What's going on in the area of so-called crisis pregnancy centers?</b><br />These centers, which are also known as pregnancy ministries, are anti-choice centers that imitate being health facilities in order to scare pregnant women who are seeking health care into not terminating their pregnancies. They have a history of using deceptive tactics and giving women biased and misleading information. For example, they'll say there's a link between abortion and breast cancer, or abortion and future infertility, both of which are false. Many are designed to look like health centers, even though they aren't licensed health facilities.</p><p>Planned Parenthood of Maryland was instrumental in getting a law passed in Baltimore that would require local pregnancy ministries to post signs stating clearly that they do not provide or refer to birth control or abortions. The new law essentially required truth in advertising. It was a significant win for women's health; it highlighted the deceptive tactics anti-choice organizations use to scare women when they're making a personal, private decision. Unfortunately, a U.S. district court recently struck down the law-but the city of Baltimore is appealing the decision.</p>",healthy eating

Menstrual cramps. <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/bikini-waxing-dangers"">Bikini wax</a>. You'd think women would have solved the problem of pain right after giving the apple to Adam. Instead, studies show that men handle pain better because they focus only on its physical effects. ""For women, pain is not just a sensory experience,"" says Ed Keogh, Ph.D., a psychologist and leading pain researcher at the University of Bath in England. ""Emotions and psychology all have an impact."" Translation: We overthink it. So take a tip from the guys and stop being so thoughtful. Here are three ways to distract yourself the next time the pain sets in.<br /><br /><b>The relief:</b> Rent <i>Wedding Crashers</i> tonight.<br /><b>The reason:</b> The pain threshold of female subjects increased and remained elevated for 20 minutes after watching a funny video clip, according to a new study in the International Journal of Humor Research. Like exercise, laughter releases endorphins - morphine-like molecules produced by the body to clobber pain. The more you laugh, the higher your pain tolerance.<br /><b>When to use it:</b> Cramps, joint pain, postsurgery.<br /><br /><b>The relief:</b> Listen to yourself on your <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/ipod-workouts"">iPod</a>.<br /><b>The reason:</b> Brain music therapy (BMT) - a new procedure that translates an image of your brain waves when you're relaxed into a custom CD of classical music - combats pain because your brain knows your best soothing patterns, says Galina Mindlin, M.D., Ph.D., a psychiatrist and BMT pioneer. (Find out more at brainmusictreatment.com.) If that's too big a leap, a little John Mayer - or any music that relaxes you - will help reduce pain, says Marion Good, Ph.D., a music therapy researcher at Case Western Reserve University. <br /><b>When to use it:</b> At the dentist, bikini wax.<br /><br /><b>The relief:</b> Open the blinds.<br /><b>The reason:</b> The brighter the room, the less pain medication patients require, a recent study found. ""Light alters the brain's chemical balance by increasing the levels of serotonin, making you less aware of the pain you feel,"" says Bruce Rabin, M.D., of the University of Pittsburgh. Dim rooms are fine for relaxing, but when beating the pain is the main objective, let there be light.<br /><b>When to use it:</b> Hospital stay, doctor's office. <br /><br /><b>The Mother of All Pain</b><br /><br />Childbirth: The one pain he'll never know. But for the 40 percent of women who go through labor without an epidural, there's not even a close second. So train yourself to better handle the pain with this technique from Pam England, midwife and author of <i>Birthing from Within</i>: Hold an ice cube in each hand and concentrate on your surroundings, the temperature, sounds, colors, and, yes, that stinging sensation in your palms. This exercise channels your pain outward instead of inward, England says. Practice the technique when you're relaxed first; then put it into action to ease childbirth or any acute pain. <br />",

Ask her what made her do it, and she humbly says anyone else would have done the same.<br /><br /><br /><br />But not everyone would have. When it comes to answering the call of duty, many people would rather let it go to voicemail. On the ABC show What Would You Do? hidden cameras capture nice, ordinary folks ignoring the bullying of an overweight stranger or saying nothing as a waitress is sexually harassed. ""Fear, conformity to authority, and aversion to risk run deep,"" says Frank Farley, Ph.D., a psychologist at Temple University in Philadelphia. ""Most people don't want to take heroic action if it will put them in danger.""<br /><br /><br /><br />In fact, he adds, some people may be, in part, genetically predisposed to avoiding such action or the risk-taking that he believes is a necessary component of it. Even those who have Wonder Woman DNA may still be held back by the ""bystander effect,"" the psychological phenomenon that occurs when multiple witnesses to a crime or confrontation each assume someone else will intervene-so no one does anything.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sounds bleak, but despite the natural human instinct to flee danger rather than put ourselves in the middle of it, 20 percent of people have intervened in ""heroic fashion,"" according to a Stanford University study of 4,000 adults. Asked whether they had ever accomplished an act or deed that other people considered heroic, respondents noted a range of behaviors, including helping another person in a dangerous emergency, blowing the whistle on an injustice, and sacrificing for a stranger. ""It's not always a big physical risk,"" says Christine Carter, Ph.D., a sociologist at the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California at Berkeley. ""It can be just as heroic to take a big emotional or social risk.""<br /><br /></p><p></p><p>It's still not totally clear whether heroism is something you're born with (or without) or a quality you develop over time, but more experts are beginning to believe it's the latter. ""Many different traits go into being a hero, and some of those can be learned,"" says Farley. He estimates that anywhere from 20 to 60 percent of risk-taking characteristics can be inherited. ""That still leaves quite a range for environment and upbringing to play a role,"" he says.<br /><br /></p><p>Empathy, another vital hero trait, begins to develop during early childhood. Kids who are taught how their behavior affects other people are better able to put themselves in others' positions, and that can lead to a desire to help. Connolly, the oldest of three girls, had plenty of experience with empathy and helping. As a teen, she worked as a lifeguard and grew comfortable with the idea that she might one day need to jump into a situation and save someone who was in trouble.<br /><br /><br /><br />""People can develop skills that make it more likely they'll act heroically,"" says Carter.<br /><br /><br /><br />""The first step is not believing that a hero is something you either are or aren't. It involves a set of skills that you can learn and practice."" Here are some ways to start:<br /><br /></p><p></p><p><b>Think Like a Hero</b></p><p>In other words, practice empathy. One way to do that is to follow the lead of Philip Zimbardo, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at Stanford University: Last year, he launched The Heroic Imagination Project (HIP) to teach regular citizens how to be heroes. HIP encourages daily good deeds-not because they are heroic, but because they help sharpen your social focus, which makes you better able to notice when people are in need or when a situation might escalate in a dangerous way. Carter calls these small acts ""radical kindness"" and says they help us cultivate our capacity to act when needed.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Nurture Your Inner Daredevil</b><br /><br />""It may sound simplistic, but even altering your route to work or what you eat each day so that you're trying new things can build your tolerance for risk, change, and uncertainty,"" says Farley. ""Engaging in new experiences is a way to push yourself along the risk-taking continuum."" Start small and gradually work your way up to something that you've been nervous about doing, whether it's rock climbing or speaking in front of a group.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Practice Positive Conflict Resolution</b><br /><br />Heroes don't run from confrontation, they engage in it. ""When you avoid conflict, you aren't dealing with it in a constructive manner,"" says Carter. So the next time you have an argument with a coworker or your guy, rather than agreeing to disagree or avoiding him, make an active attempt to see his point of view. This simple act will start to build your confidence for dealing with conflict.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Reach Out</b><br /><br /><br />""Empathy is a key component of heroism, and in our culture it's on a massive decline,"" says Carter. ""As a society, we're focused on achievements and status symbols like jobs and cars, and we're losing our sense of responsibility toward others. If your primary identity is tied to helping others, rather than your social status, you're much likelier to act heroically."" That may be why research has found that people who volunteer are more likely to be heroes.<br /><br /><br /><br />Find a way to donate some time to helping others and you'll develop your ability to empathize, which not only increases the odds of your rising to the occasion when duty calls but also boosts your confidence and happiness. And that's a double payoff.<br /></p>",

Want to know why? To reveal that sexy, sculpted middle, you have to target more than the small section of abs that crunches hit, say Alwyn Cosgrove and Lou Schuler in their book <i>The New Rules of Lifting for Abs</i>. You need to work your entire core by encouraging it to do the job it's meant to do: stabilize your spine.<br /><br /><br /><br />Cosgrove and Schuler's groundbreaking program is based on the concept that a healthy, sculpted body is the result of your muscles working the way they were intended. Because your core's main function is to keep you upright, each unique exercise in the program falls into one of the three stabilization categories below.<br /><br /><br /><br />Progressively incorporate the moves on<a href=""/fitness/ab-workout-women"">The No Crunch Zone Workout</a> into your regular workout, and in a matter of weeks that stubborn pooch will vanish.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Stabilization</b><br /></p><p>Exercises in this category stabilize your spine and pelvis by holding your body in a static position for a set amount of time. We know what you're thinking: Not that boring old plank! But this much-maligned move develops your deepest core muscles, which cinch in your waist like a corset, and it just may be the key to that coveted flat belly.<br /><br /><br /><br />Your first goal is to master holding the basic plank with solid form for 90 seconds (45 seconds for side planks). Then you will be ready to move on to more advanced versions-and that's where things get interesting. Minor tweaks, such as holding one of your arms or legs above the floor, become challenging variations that shift your center of gravity and work your deep stabilizing muscles in new ways. Plus, there's nothing boring about holding a plank with your forearms on a stability ball-your core muscles have to adjust to keep your lower back steady and prevent you from face-planting on the gym floor.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Dynamic Stabilization</b><br /></p><p>This category ups the ante: You'll move your arms or legs instead of holding them in a static position. Your core remains still, so those muscles continue to work hard to support your spine, but the added movement forces the surrounding muscles to get in on the action too. The key to performing these exercises successfully is moving the body parts that are supposed to move-and <i>only</i> those parts. It's harder than it sounds, as you'll quickly learn when you try the stability-ball mountain climber and the side plank and row. These moves may take some patience and perseverance, but the payoff-increased coordination, balance, and athleticism (as well as, duh, fantastic abs)-more than make up for the tough learning curve.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Integrated Stabilization</b><br /></p><p>The goal of the moves in this category is to challenge your core muscles to support your spine under conditions that most closely resemble what you encounter in everyday life-from carrying groceries to lugging a suitcase to chasing after a toddler. So while the dumbbell offloaded farmer's walk and the suitcase deadlift and lateral step-up may not look like traditional core exercises, to pull them off you have to engage your entire midsection. And rather than moving on to a tougher variation, you add weight, reps, or distance to make these exercises more difficult.<br /><br /><br /><br />Relax, you don't need to commit all this to memory: <a href=""/fitness/ab-workout-women"">The No-Crunch Zone workout</a> makes it a breeze.

And with thousands of miles of new bicycle lanes across the United States, the two-wheeled commute has never been easier.<br /><br />Still, most of us opt for driving, armed with an arsenal of excuses for not peddling our way to work. <i>Bicycling</i> magazine has solutions to all of them.</p><p><strong>Traffic Scares Me</strong><br />Two simple principles greatly improve your safety: ride predictably and ride visibly. How? On wide roads, ride just to the right of the traffic lane; on narrow roads, stay just inside the traffic lane so vehicles must partly cross the middle line to pass. (This removes the temptation to try to squeeze by you.) For turns, work your way into the proper lane 150 feet early; if you can't get there 40 to 50 feet before the turn, go straight and double back. And stay at least a foot away from curbs--passing autos push debris to the curb, creating a littered path. </p><p><strong>I Don't Have Time</strong><br />Studies by groups such as New York City's Transportation Alternatives have shown that trips of less than 3 miles are often quicker by bike, and urban trips of 5 to 7 miles usually take about the same time. Plus, you can use your ride to work as an extra cardio workout. The average American drives 29 miles per day. If you substitute one day's worth of driving with riding per week, in a year you'll burn enough calories to lose 19 pounds. You'll also reduce auto emissions by 1,248 pounds of CO2, and save more than $800 on gas and maintenance. </p><p><strong>I'll Smell</strong><br />If your office has showers, drive once or twice a week, carrying a few days' worth of clothes you can store there. Or, you could shower at your gym if it's near your office. If neither of those is an option, wear a sweat-wicking jersey and bike shorts on your ride in. After arriving, wait 10 to 20 minutes for your body to stop sweating, then wipe off with baby wipes (especially your pits, crotch, face and feet). If you showered that morning, you should be suitably fresh. </p><p><strong>There's No Place to Keep My Bike</strong><br />To lock your bike safely out on the street, use two different types of locks, such as a U-lock plus a chain-and-padlock. (That forces thieves to carry several tools--which means they'll look for easier prey than your bike.)</p><p><strong>I Live Too Far Away</strong><br />Can't commit to 15 miles or more each way? Cut the mileage in half: The first day, drive to work with your bike, then ride home that night. Ride to work the next morning, then drive home. Repeat euphorically. </p><p><strong>I Have to Drop the Kids Off</strong><br />Drive your kids to school and ride the rest of the way to work. Or, organize a car pool in your neighborhood. Or best of all, ride with your kids to school--they'll be the envy of their class. If you carry them in a trailer or a trail-a-bike you can often arrange to leave it at the school until you return. </p><p><strong>My Boss Says No</strong><br />Tell her it'll improve productivity and reduce absenteeism: 80 percent of people who switch from driving to bike commuting improve the function and health of their heart, lungs and blood vessels in 8 weeks, according to the advocacy group Transportation Alternatives.</p>",
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/detoxing,Health,22,30,30,12,0,0,9,0,,Do You Have a Detoxifying Obsession?,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1104-worried-sick.jpg,"It all started, innocently enough, with the dryer sheets a few months ago.<br /><br />While they might make your laundry smell like a summer day, I had just read that the flimsy leaflets actually coat your clothes with a thin layer of toxic chemicals. As a health writer, I regularly come across a fair number of startling facts about contaminants, but this time was different: I had an infant in the next room. I threw our box of dryer sheets in the trash that day.<br /><br />Problem solved. Until I read about dust.<br /><br />A little online searching revealed that not only is common house dust loaded with noxious particles and allergenic dead bug bits <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/allergens-1"">like dust mites</a> (eww), but the cleaning solution used to wipe it up could cause just about every ailment known to mankind (breast cancer, diabetes, memory impairment...oh my!). And then there were our bedsheets and towels, all crawling with germs that could be killed only by bleach-the same bleach that could lead to respiratory problems. What's more, wearing your sneakers indoors tracks dangerous pesticides (and other nasties you pick up outside) through the house.<br /><br />So I banned chemical-laden cleaning products, made guests remove their shoes at the door, and launched an all-out assault on dust and dirt. Soon what little free time I had was spent vacuuming toxins off the lampshades. All worth it, I figured, to keep my family safe from crippling illnesses and premature death.<br /><br />Of course, feeding them was another challenge entirely. I began paying double for organic, pesticide-free produce and hormone-free milk. Free-range chicken at the co-op set me back $9 for three small halves. But even as these changes lightened my wallet, they did nothing to ease my mind, because the threats were piling up faster than the laundry. One week it was the electromagnetic-frequency-emitting cell phone I used as an alarm clock; the next, the baby monitor. After I'd banished both, I still found myself lying awake at night, plagued by worry.<br /><br /><b>Unhealthy Extremes</b><br />It was money that finally brought me to my senses. Not the small fortune I was shelling out for elite food and eco-cleaners, but the actual greenbacks themselves. A new study trumpeted that bills are tainted with bisphenol-A (BPA), which, according to the National Toxicology Program, can have negative effects on ""the brain, behavior, and prostate glands in fetuses, infants, and children.""<br /><br />With that news, I was done. It made no difference how many hours I spent researching dangers, naturally disinfecting surfaces, arguing with my laidback husband (who insisted I was driving myself crazy over nothing), and fighting the world's worst case of static cling. I couldn't quit cash.<br /><br />Surprisingly, instead of feeling defeated, I felt free. I realized I couldn't be expected to purify every aspect of my family's life. News headlines emphasize life's dangers and then tantalizingly offer solutions for ridding your home, your food, and your body of contaminants. I'm not the first to be sucked in by those claims-or hopelessly confused by them. Just to be sure, though, I called a few experts for a second opinion.<br /><br />""'Detoxing' can become a coping skill that's used to gain a sense of control when life feels overwhelming,"" says psychotherapist Julie Hanks, M.S.W. In other words, you may not be able to control stock-market crashes or terrorism, but you can nix pesticides from your kitchen.<br /><br />But this control tactic can backfire: When you spend all of your time worrying about everything that could possibly harm you, and spend a hunk of your money trying to delete those dangers from your life, the intense stress it causes can have a bigger impact on your lifestyle than BPA or any other scary-sounding acronym.<br /><br />""Detoxing is about taking a break and renewing and rejuvenating ourselves,"" says Gerard E. Mullin, M.D., an associate professor of medicine at The Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. ""But if you take it to extremes, you may do yourself more harm by living in a state of anxiety.""<br /><br />Balance is the only approach that works for me. Some changes are so easy that it doesn't make sense not to make them-toting a stainless-steel water bottle in lieu of a BPA-containing plastic one to the gym, for example. I'm still not ecstatic about the static in my clothes, but because it's easier and cheaper-as well as healthier-not to use dryer sheets, I'm willing to put up with a little shock therapy. But I gave up the $8 organic shampoo and went back to my $3 suds. I still buy my toddler organic, hormone-free milk, but my husband and I stick with the regular stuff.<br /><br />And something amazing has happened: I've stopped lying awake at night, worrying that our toilet-bowl cleaner will give me cancer or that the carpeting in the nursery might off-gas and melt my son's brain. Even though I've let my guard down, my family and I are way happier than we were when I was spending my precious spare time hunting down pesticides, synthetic chemicals, and stray electromagnetic waves. I can now actually enjoy our home-and start letting good things in instead of keeping bad things out.","clean living,eco-friendly"

But by the time you're a serious couple-maybe even <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/6-things-to-consider-before-shacking-up"">living together</a>-you probably assume you know your bedmate's every last habit, flaw, and idiosyncrasy. Don't be so sure.</p><p>According to new research published in <i>The Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy</i>, one in 10 men are harboring serious <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/guys-secrets"">sex secrets</a> of one kind or another. ""There are two kinds of secrets guys keep,"" says Les Parrott, author of <i>Crazy Good Sex</i>. ""Things they wish their wives or girlfriends would understand but are scared they won't, and things they're just plain trying to get away with."" </p><p>With that in mind, we polled hundreds of men to learn what they hide at each stage in a relationship and enlisted experts to offer their insights. We discovered there's a decent chance your man is keeping at least one dirty secret. Read on to find out what, if anything, you should do about this potentially huge <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/relationship-advice-0"">relationship</a> issue.</p><p></p><p><b>When You're Dating...</b></p><p><b>What he's hiding: The number of women he's had sex with</b><br />Some men exaggerate to sound more sexually experienced; others lowball so you don't dismiss them as players. ""Men know that if they confess to a large number of partners, it sends the message that they're unlikely to commit to one. That is, to you,"" says David Buss, a professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin and author of<i> The Evolution of Desire</i>. </p><p><b>What you should do</b> Take him at his word, but protect yourself. Be vigilant about using a condom every time you have<a href=""/sex-and-relationships/sex-myths-busted""> sex</a>-at least until you've both been tested for STDs and you feel secure that you're in a committed relationship. If you do somehow discover that he's deceived you about his sexual history, get it out in the open, but give him a chance to explain. ""He could have fibbed out of embarrassment, insecurity, or sincere interest in you,"" says Ian Kerner, Ph.D., author of <i>She Comes First: The Thinking Man's Guide to Pleasuring a Woman</i>. </p><p><b>What he's hiding: He looks at porn-maybe a lot</b><br />According to a study at Brigham Young University, 87 percent of men have looked at some form of porn in the past year, and one in five help themselves to X-rated fare daily. Men like to look at naked chicks-no surprise there-but what is shocking is how quickly they can become dependent on those erotic images. A powerful pleasure cocktail of endorphins and epinephrine (hormones responsible for arousal and alertness) are released while a man watches porn, Parrott says. And that feeling can become addictive.</p><p><b>What you should do</b> Occasional porn isn't the problem; it only becomes a wrecking ball when it starts to intrude on your sex life together. ""The two big questions are 'Is it interfering with your life and relationship?' and 'Is he using it to avoid something?'"" says sex therapist Sandor Gardos, Ph.D. If he actively hides his material and makes excuses to avoid having sex, be concerned. </p><p>Broach the subject when you're calm and rational. ""Angry accusations never go over well,"" Gardos says. Another tactic: Suggest watching together. ""It becomes compulsive when he feels like he has to hide it,"" he says. So if you're willing to share it with him, you'll take the compulsion out of the equation. Plus, experts say, viewing erotic images together can enhance your sex life. </p><p><b>What he's hiding: He compares you to his last girlfriend</b><br />It's true: Your guy whips out his ex ruler and measures everything about you: your looks, your bedroom abilities, how well you get along with his friends. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. ""It's normal to make comparisons, and an ex is his most recent reference point,"" says Christopher Blazina, Ph.D., associate professor of psychology at Tennessee State University. </p><p><b>What you should do</b> Nothing. He'll inevitably come to the conclusion that you blow away anyone else he's ever been with, and the silent comparathon raging in his mind will cease. When you should do something: if he frequently blurts out things like ""My ex always..."" or ""My last girlfriend never..."" It's not necessarily a sign that he hasn't gotten over her, but it can still be hurtful, Blazina says. When that happens, it's fair to tell him, for example, that you don't want him bringing up the details of their trip to Mexico. Chances are, he's not even aware he's been doing it and will be happy to stop.</p><p><b>When You're Seriously Dating or Engaged</b></p><p><b>What he's hiding: He still masturbates-probably more than you think</b><br />Twenty percent of the guys <i>Women's Health</i> polled admitted to taking matters into their own hands daily; another 33 percent fessed up to self-pleasuring three times a week-usually alone, often in the shower. </p><p><b>What you should do</b> It depends on how much his habit affects you. Masturbation itself is normal behavior, but if he's avoiding sex or having trouble peaking when he's with you, those could be signs it's gotten, uh, out of hand. ""There are guys who will have sex with a partner once or twice a month, and masturbate 20 to 25 times,"" says psychologist Barry McCarthy, Ph.D., co­author of Discovering Your Couple Sexual Style. </p><p>If you suspect that's the case, try to refocus his hands where they belong: on you. Kerner suggests sharing a hot fantasy or dirty thought with him and seeing if that will draw his attention back to the relationship. Some men are going solo more often these days to relieve their economic stress. Sound like your guy? Treat him to extra physical affection (give him a back rub, scratch his head). This will help him associate comfort and calmness with you.</p><p><b>What he's hiding: He's been talking to at least one past love online </b><br />Technology has made it easier than ever to reconnect with former flames. In the past four years, the number of adults with profiles on social-networking sites has quadrupled. Experts say that men may reach out to an ex as a sort of insurance policy. ""People like to have backups, not necessarily to form a long-term relationship with now, but to have as a placeholder so they're not left high and dry should their existing relationship end,"" Buss says.</p><p><b>What you should do</b> ""Often these placeholders are never used, so there's no need to worry or do anything about it,"" Buss says. But if you're spotting signs that his new Facebook friend may be more than just a platonic e-pal-he regularly finds excuses to go online, he tries to conceal his correspondence-he may be up to no good. ""Say every time you two get into an argument he immediately goes online-that's a concern,"" Gardos says. ""And in that case, you might need to evaluate his commitment to you.""</p><p><b>What he's hiding: He's afraid he won't be able to stay faithful for life</b><br />Affairs are on the rise. A recent analysis of data from the General Social Survey found that up to 20 percent of men under 30 have been unfaithful, a 5 percent increase since 15 years ago. To make matters worse, our culture does a lot to propagate the myth that sex starts to suffer as soon as you say ""I do,"" Parrott says. A University of North Texas study found that married couples in movies are rarely depicted as having a good sex life. ""It's a common male perspective, especially in the early years of marriage,"" he says. </p><p><b>What you should do</b> Fact is, many couples do find that sex starts to wane after exchanging wedding vows. So your objective should be to assure him that you two will beat the odds. Spice things up by suggesting new positions and get it on in new places, from the kitchen counter to a backyard hammock. </p><p></p><p><b>When You're Married...</b></p><p><b>What he's hiding: He wants sex twice as much as he's having it with you</b><br />His concerns about post-wedding sex (see above) may have been well-founded: One study showed that men want 50 percent more action than they're currently getting. Even so, most guys would rather suffer in silence than bring up the subject with you. ""He might be afraid that talking about it will go badly,"" Blazina says. He may also fear that the reason you're not in the mood as often as he'd like is that his skills in the bedroom are less than mind-blowing.</p><p><b>What you should do</b> If he's always the one to initiate sex and you're often batting him away, you need to change course. Since research has shown that a satisfying sex life is connected to long-term stability, it's important to try to find middle ground-be the one to get things started once in a while and respond to his advances a little more often. ""Your desire levels are not always going to be equal, but you need to be reasonably compatible,"" Blazina says. ""Otherwise, those little moments of rejection grow into a sense of deep separation."" </p><p><b>What he's hiding: He flirts with someone he works with</b><br />Two-thirds of Americans report that their workplaces are full of flirtations, says Janet Lever, Ph.D., a sociologist at California State University, Los Angeles. Experts say it's only natural for work crushes to spring up: ""Our coworkers are prime targets,"" Lever says, ""because the office is where we spend so much of our time."" </p><p><b>What you should do</b>Overwhelmingly, workplace infatuations are innocent, not serious: ""In my research, only 9 percent of flirtations led to someone leaving his or her partner,"" Lever says. Signs you have something to worry about: he starts paying more attention to his appearance; your sex life suffers; he mentions one colleague's name more than others'; he's suddenly working late a lot. If you don't spot these red flags, it's safe to assume the threat is minimal. </p><p><b>What he's hiding: He's fantasized about a guy-and maybe acted on it</b><br />According to McCarthy's research, this is more typical than you might guess. ""The fourth most common sexual fantasy among straight men is sex with another male, especially receiving oral sex from a guy,"" McCarthy says. But the great majority of men do not act on the fantasy. </p><p><b>What you should do</b> Stay calm, and don't jump to conclusions. ""The majority of males with this fantasy are not gay or bisexual,"" McCarthy says. ""What makes a fantasy erotic is that it's different from the reality of your sexual life."" Even if you do find out he's been with another man in the past, there's probably no reason to panic. ""Some men have done it, either as part of a threesome or alone,"" Kerner says. ""If it was a one-time thing, chalk it up to experimentation."" However, if you find a stash of gay porn or he's constantly pushing for a three-way with another man, you need to talk to him honestly about his sexual orientation. </p>",Gear

But have you ever wondered just <em>how</em> fit you are? Just for fun, test your fitness and see how fit you really are by taking our series of fitness challenges in this video, below. Here's how each of the challenges works. Then watch the video to see proper form, and scroll all the way down to see how you tested.</p><p><strong>The Challenges:</strong></p><p><strong>Endurance Challenge: Leg Matrix</strong><br />You'll do each of these four moves back to back without resting. The moves: <br />1. Squat<br />2. Squat Jump<br />3. Lunge (right leg, then left leg)<br />4. Lunge Jump (right leg, then left leg)</p><p>Do the correct form of each move and immediately move on to the next one without resting. See how many you can do with proper form before you have to take a break. The number or reps you can do with correct form without resting will tell you how fit your endurance is - see below the video to see how you stack up.</p><p><strong>Agility Challenge: Four-Point Touch</strong><br />To do this test, you'll set up four cones in a square, five yards apart. You'll start in the center of the cones with your knees bent and your hips slightly forward. Set a timer to 15 seconds, and then move as quickly as possible to the front left cone, touch it, and move back to the center. Then move to the front right cone, touch it, and move back to the center. Continue running to each of the four cones in order. You're trying to see how many times you touch the cones in the 15 seconds. See what your results mean after the video.</p><p><strong>Balance Challenge: Single-Leg Balance and Touch</strong><br />You'll measure both legs separately. Perform the Single-Leg Balance and Touch, doing it in perfect form on one leg over and over for 60 seconds. See how many you can do in that time, and then repeat the test on the other side. Check your results below to see how you did for each side.</p><p><strong>Lower-Body Strength Challenge: Three-Rep Single-Leg Squat</strong><br />You'll test both legs individually, starting with the right leg. You'll perform the the single-leg squat with proper form, where the move gets progressively harder (see the video for a demonstration). Then see below to see how you did.</p><p><strong>Hip Flexor Flexibility Challenge: The Thomas Test</strong><br />Perform the move as demonstrated in the video below, then check your results.</p><p><strong>Core Stability Challenge: The Walk Out</strong><br />Perform the move as demonstrated in the video below.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/improve-senses,Health,12,29,12,25,0,2,7,0,,How to Improve Your Senses,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/senses-art.jpg,"<p>Imagine the following scene: You're softly swinging in a hammock, on a black sand beach in Maui...sipping a banana-mango smoothie...listening to the waves crash against the shore. A cool ocean breeze caresses your face...the scent of orchids fills the air...your cocoa-butter-scented guy softly runs his fingers through your hair....</p><p>Pretty freakin' nice, right? OK, now press ""rewind"" and try to imagine the same scene without your senses working full throttle-your ears plugged up, your taste buds on hiatus, and your sense of touch as finely tuned as the old guitar in your parents' attic. Not so mind-blowing this time, is it?</p><p>The problem is, most of us take our senses for granted-and that's so not a smart thing, because life's a lot less interesting when they're not operating at peak capacity. But thanks to blaring iPods, long stretches on the PC, even the occasional nasty sunburn, you may be slowly and imperceptibly chipping away at your five functions. So we've come up with these easy ways to sharpen your senses to Ginsu-knife perfection. Because that beachside hammock is empty, kiddo. And just waiting for you.</p><p><strong>Vision</strong><br />Your eyes may be tiny, but they're as complex as the plot of a David Lynch movie. A quick tutorial: Vision occurs when light reflected off of an object enters the eye through the cornea (the transparent covering) and reaches the lens, which projects the image upside-down onto your retina (the nerve layer lining the back of the eye). These nerves send the image to the brain, which then flips it right-side-up and...heelloo there! If you have 20/20 vision, you can make out what a normal-sighted person can see from 20 feet away. Some lucky folks can see 20/10, and some birds' vision is 20/2, meaning they can see clearly at 20 feet what the average person can see only from two feet away. Smoking, shunning sunglasses, and aging all contribute to less-than-stellar vision, but we have ways to protect your peepers:</p><p><strong>Take the long view.</strong> Sure, it's hard to tear yourself away from that YouTube video of the incredible waterskiing squirrel, but keeping your nose planted just a few inches from the monitor will strain your eyes. ""Close-up vision uses a 'focusing' muscle that relaxes when you're looking at something in the distance,"" says Ruth Williams, M.D., clinical correspondent for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. ""To give your eyes a rest, stop every 10 minutes and gaze out the window-for at least 30 seconds-at a spot that's at least 100 feet away.""</p><p><strong>Get all teary-eyed.</strong> The average person blinks up to 15 times per minute (that's more than 14,000 times a day), but long stretches spent staring-whether it's at an important Excel file or a marathon of The Hills-can slow your flutter rate to three or four times a minute. That leads to dry eyes, a leading cause of blurry vision. Drop a few bucks on a bottle of artificial tears (like GenTeal Lubricant Eye Drops, $12.50, <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.drugstore.com"">drugstore.com</a>) and squeeze out a drop or two anytime your eyes start to feel parched.</p><p><strong>Make like a bunny.</strong> That would be Bugs, not one of Hef's babes. Lutein and beta-carotene, antioxidants found in carrots, have been shown to help stave off macular degeneration, a disease that causes a blurred or blind spot in the middle of your field of vision. A recent National Institutes of Health study found that beta-carotene supplements don't do bupkis, so get your nutrients at the dinner table. (Other rich sources of beta-carotene include sweet potatoes, apricots, and broccoli.)</p><p><strong>Kick someone's butt in a game of Halo 3.</strong> According to a recent study at the University of Rochester, playing video action games improves the spatial resolution of your vision. That means it's easier to zero in on and pick something out of a crowd-like locating Waldo's striped shirt.</p><p><strong>Hearing</strong><br />When Christina's stratospheric riffs travel across the radio waves and out your speakers, the vibration travels down your ear canal and hits your eardrum. That membrane picks up the vibes, activating the 15,000 hairs in your inner ear, which move the melody through your nerves up to the brain...and let the slow-dancing begin. What sucks: Almost everything we're exposed to these days-from honking SUVs to the Foo Fighters at Red Rocks-can hurt those delicate hairs. Nearly 10 percent of twentysomethings have already done so much damage that they have trouble hearing higher frequencies. But you can help preserve what you've still got:</p><p>Get micro with music When listening to a song, pay close attention to each instrument. Don't concentrate on just the cowbell in ""Don't Fear the Reaper""; focus on the guitars, then the drums, then the lead singer's pseudo-British pronunciations. ""By training your ears to single out individual sounds-which helps your brain recognize them more easily in the future-you can sharpen your hearing,"" says William Luxford, M.D., an associate at the House Ear Institute in Los Angeles.</p><p>Nuke the noise Chuck the standard-issue iPod earbuds and replace them with clamor-canceling headphones. ""Blocking out background sound enables you to keep the volume lower,"" says Sergei Kochkin, Ph.D., executive director of the Better Hearing Institute in Washington, DC. If you're willing to drop some cash and don't mind looking like a DJ, go top drawer: Bose QuietComfort 3 ($350, <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.bose.com"">bose.com</a>). Low on dough? The JVC HA-NCX77 Noise Canceling Earbuds ($45, <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.circuitcity.com"">circuitcity.com</a>) leave you with cash for downloads.</p><p><strong>Smell and Taste</strong><br />Even the ripest, juiciest pear will taste like cardboard if your nose is as stuffed as a sports bar on Super Bowl Sunday. That's because your 10,000 taste buds pick up only four basic flavors: sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. Your body relies on your sense of smell to fill in the rest. How this works: Odor molecules float inside your nostrils and attach themselves to tiny hairs, which trigger cells at the back of your nose that detect smell and taste. The average person can differentiate from among 4,000 to 10,000 odor molecules. Unfortunately, cigarette smoke can deaden both your taste buds and your nose's scent receptors, so you can be susceptible to long-term damage if you puff. Our advice: Toss out the smokes and try these taste-and-smell tips:</p><p><strong>Keep your nose clean.</strong> You know that a head cold can temporarily play havoc with your sense of smell. But did you also know that the more colds you get, the more you risk hurting your sniffer for good? ""If the receptor cells inside your nose become damaged by cold viruses, it can cause permanent injury,"" according to R.I. Henkin, M.D., of the Taste and Smell Clinic in Washington, DC. So cold prevention is key. Top on doctors' lists: Keep your hands clean: Scrub up for at least 30 seconds each time you wash.</p><p><strong>Banish the bleach.</strong> Germophobes, beware: Noxious fumes from sprays and scouring products can kill your sense of smell along with all that nasty bacteria. Instead, scrub down your tubs, basins, and countertops with vinegar-based or other ""green"" cleaning products, like Deidre Imus's Greening the Cleaning spray ($5, <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.lnt.com"">lnt.com</a>).</p><p><strong>Become a pot head.</strong> Studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison have shown that nasal irrigation helps improve both smell and taste by getting rid of scent-blocking gunk inside your schnoz. How to do it: Dissolve a quarter-teaspoon of salt in eight ounces of warm water. Press your ear to your shoulder and, using a neti pot (<a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.amazon.com"">amazon.com</a> sells 'em for $12 a pop), pour the solution into your upper nostril...then watch it stream out the lower one.</p><p><strong>Give it a whiff.</strong> ""Ever wonder how a wine connoisseur can distinguish subtle scents that the average person can't?"" says Terence M. Davidson, M.D., director of head and neck surgery at the UC San Diego Nasal Dysfunction Clinic. No, it's not a golden nose-it's training yourself to pick apart smells and tastes. At the mall perfume counter, try to pinpoint the individual notes in a fragrance. Or sample a new dish at your favorite restaurant and name all the flavor nuances you detect in each bite.</p><p><strong>Touch</strong><br />What an ingenious system: Your guy plants a wet one on you, and sensory receptors under the skin signal your brain to release various chemicals, including the happy juice serotonin. But you could be missing out on the joys of subtler touches (like your guy gently stroking your hair). That's because, starting in our twenties, we lose about 1 percent of our sense of touch every year-and the damage can be accelerated if you play rough with your skin (yipes, sunburn!). Fortunately, we have ways to keep your fingertips happy:</p><p><strong>Glove it or leave it.</strong> Remember the time you Krazy-Glued your fingers together? Not fun. Harsh chemicals and solvents can burn away the cells on your skin's surface, leaving your epidermis...well, words like sandpaper and lizard come to mind. To keep your skin safe during DIY projects, make like a neurotic hand model and slip on gloves anytime you're going to be in direct contact with things like bleach and turpentine.</p><p><strong>Get creamed.</strong> The rougher and drier your skin, the harder it is to arouse those sensory receptors underneath, which slows down the flow of messages they send to the brain. Keep your dermis well-hydrated and your nerve endings fired up by slathering on a creamy moisturizer. One we love: Boots Expert Instant Soothing Lotion ($7 for 500 ml, <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.target.com"">target.com</a>). It's fragrance-free and packed with moisture-locking ingredients like glycerin, vitamin E, and cocoa butter.</p><p><strong>Say hello to Lars and his magic fingers.</strong> Massages don't just feel toe-curlingly good-they're truly good for you. That's because repeated pressure stimulates sensory receptors in the skin tissue, making them even more hair-trigger sensitive. (Think of it as toning up your sense of touch.) But indulging in sessions with Lars isn't the only way to get stimulated. You can rub down your skin with an exfoliating scrub, go for a swim, or do the horizontal mambo (man, the things we do in the name of health!). For that last one, a luxurious body oil will increase the hydration; try Babeland Lickable Oils ($10 for 1 oz, <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.babeland.com"">babeland.com</a>).</p><p> </p>",

But the hips aren't only the most overlooked joints in the body, they're also the most crucial to your overall health and well-being. ""Your hips are the foundation of your anatomy,"" says Natalie Nevins, D.O., an osteopathic physician with a private practice in Hollywood. ""If hips are not stable, nothing above or below them will be either.""</p><p></p><p>The good news: Working your hips is easy.The best way to stretch them: Get down. Literally. ""On the floor, you can sit in a pose from 10 breaths to 10 minutes and notice some improvement,"" says Seane Corn, a renowned yoga teacher at Sacred Movement in Santa Monica, California. ""The more your body has an opportunity to melt into the shape, the deeper your experience will be physically and psychologically.""<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>If after a couple of practice sessions your muscles still feel stiffer than John Kerry delivering a punch line, tight hips may be in your DNA, Corn says.

Instead, simply do these poses without folding.</p><p></p><p>The first pose in this sequence is ""very passive for a reason,"" Corn says. But don't be mistaken, that's not to say it's easy.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/understanding-men,Sex And Relationships,15,29,8,4,0,1,0,0,,Understanding Men,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0811-get-inside-his.jpg,"<p>At breakfast the other day, I made the mistake of opening my laptop when my wife felt like talking. I was happily trolling YouTube, but Ruth wanted to dish about how her friend's nanny is becoming a total hoochie mama.</p><p>""You're fun this morning,"" Ruth sniffed when she realized I wasn't <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/communication-advice"">listening</a>. (I was watching clips of lunatics who like to parachute off of skyscrapers.)</p><p>On the surface, we were at a typical male-female impasse. Ruth wanted to <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/men-and-phone-calls"">connect</a>; I just needed a little space. Moments like this happen all the time with us--like the previous night, when I became a jaw-­gritting mute after Ruth casually mentioned that an ex-boyfriend from college had made her a Facebook friend. She was like, ""Omigod! His kids are so adorable!"" I was like, ""Rrrrrrr.""</p><p>Clearly this pattern was telling us something, and not just that we should spend less time online. It turns out that her craving for chitchat and my habit of shutting down are pre-existing conditions--gender differences that go back hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p><b>A Great Divide</b><br />The female brain, and therefore Ruth, has a meatier frontal cortex than this grunting, monosyllabic husband of hers. That part of the brain is associated with complex functions--like language and decision making. Ruth also packs more power in parts of her limbic cortex, which stokes her feelings and her need to ""share."" Finally, because guys tend to process <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/understand-his-emotions"">nonverbal expressions</a> less efficiently than women do, I was too slow to read Ruth's facial cues telling me, ""Laptop down and listen up, buddy boy.""</p><p>In short, it was our biology talking (or avoiding talking), at least if some fresh scientific findings are true. Until recently, neuroscientists believed that brain differences between the sexes were confined mainly to reproductive behavior. But a surge of research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and other noninvasive scans of male and female brains suggests that sex plays a role in memory, hearing, vision, emotion, even how we chill out. By extension, we could be on the verge of solving such imponderables as why men leave the toilet seat up and women dig Josh Groban.</p><p>""The brains of men and women, while similar in many ways, are more different than most scientists ever realized,"" says Larry Cahill, Ph.D., an associate at the University of California, where he researches emotion, memory, and the brain.</p><p>Consider the brain idiosyncrasies Cahill discovered by doing scans on men and women at rest. His team noticed stark differences in the behavior of the amygdala, the almond-shaped structure that helps regulate human emotion. ""Men's amygdalas interacted more with brain regions involved with the external world, like vision and hearing,"" Cahill explains, ""while women's amygdalas interacted more with their internal world--the organs, including those involved with reproduction and feelings."" In English, that means guys fixate on their surroundings--a primordial defense against predators, including those of the Facebook variety (this might also explain a raised toilet seat as a territory marker). </p><p>Last year researchers at the University of Pennsylvania used scans to try to understand how men and women handle stress. Among the findings? Anxiety activates the ""tend and befriend"" reaction in women's limbic systems and the ""fight or flight"" response in men's prefrontal cortexes. Translation: Under pressure, women reach out, while guys go Rambo. In 2004, researchers at Emory University discovered differences in how men's and women's brains respond to sexual stimuli--the takeaway being that sexual images fire male emotions (visible as activity in the amygdala) faster than a clip of Michael Jordan's farewell game. Women's brains go, Eh.</p><p><b>A Gray Matter</b><br />Of course, neat conclusions like this can lead to trouble. A couple of years ago, Louann Brizendine, M.D., a researcher with modest credentials (Harvard med school, Yale med school, blah blah blah), made a splash and then drew criticism for suggesting that the female brain was practically a species all its own. Her point was that female hormones like estrogen, progesterone, and oxytocin, as well as unique qualities in the size and function of parts of a woman's brain, radically distinguish the female mind. The result, she argued, citing colorful scans, is that women tend to be more communicative, more cooperative, less aggro, and generally more empathetic than men. ""These differences in function and structure tell the story of how different men and women are,"" Brizendine says.</p><p>Begin to tell the story, is more like it. Some researchers say that structural differences in the brain don't mean squat when it comes to behavior. Others argue that there are far more overlaps among male and female brains than there are differences and that other factors--environment and upbringing, for instance--are every bit as important as your hormones and the size of your hippocampus in influencing how you behave. </p><p>It's easy to draw provocative conclusions, says psychologist Susan Pinker, author of The Sexual Paradox. ""But people are individuals, so they don't divide cleanly into camps on most psychological measures,"" she says. Even so, average differences in how men's and women's brains look and function do suggest a biological basis for, say, why he's not getting your hint that cargo shorts are not appropriate attire for dinner with your parents.</p><p>At the very least, all this brain gazing helps me understand why my wife talks and I tune out. That's not to say I'll be adding Josh Groban to my play-list, but at least I'll try harder to listen when Ruth wants to sing his praises. Meanwhile, I shared some of this research with her, and she likes knowing that something older than us is at work inside our heads when I appear not to have evolved beyond the Neanderthal.</p><p>""We're only just beginning to understand how men and women operate neurologically,"" Cahill says. ""We know differences do exist, but we don't know yet what those differences mean. Check back with me in 30 years and I'll tell you where we're at."" I wonder if Josh Groban will still be singing the same goopy songs then.</p><p><b>Mind games</b><br />Better communication in three easy steps</p><p><b>Tell him to quit solving already</b><br />""Some studies show that men's brains respond to stress by activating a part of the limbic system that prompts action,"" psychologist Susan Pinker says. What does that mean to you? ""If you want a man to listen sympathetically instead of solving the problem for you, you'll have to say so,"" she says. </p><p><b>Give him a chance to respond</b><br />""Men don't pick up emotional nuance as quickly as women do, and women put emotion into words faster,"" says researcher Louann Brizendine, M.D., author of The Female Brain. In women's brains, the left and right hemispheres more often work simultaneously. This means women relay messages from the amygdala, where emotions are triggered, to the brain's left hemisphere, where those emotions are verbalized, more quickly. </p><p>It can be a difference of just milliseconds, but that often means the difference between having a normal conversation and thinking accusatory thoughts like ""You're not really listening to me."" </p><p>So be patient, and give him a chance to formulate a response to whatever you're saying.</p><p><b>Talk about it tomorrow</b><br />Sandra Witelson, Ph.D., and her team of researchers at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, found that women have more neurons in parts of the cortex of the temporal lobe, which is associated with processing and understanding language, than men do. ""That plays a role in why women, on average, perform better than men on verbal tasks,"" UC Irvine neuroscientist Larry Cahill, Ph.D., explains. Bottom line: Sometimes not talking about his emotions is the only way he can deal with them. Letting a day go by before coming back to the issue might get him to open up.<br /></p>",Simplify Your Life

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/haiti-stories,Life,53,28,51,4,0,0,0,0,,Survivor Story: Healing After Haiti,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1009-haiti.jpg,"<p>It's late on a Sunday afternoon, and sunset has crept up on Christa Brelsford. The 25-year-old is trying to clean the grapefruit juice she spilled on the kitchen floor, fold the laundry she left cooling in the dryer, and do a few things around the house before Monday sweeps in and carries the weekend away. The Arizona sun shines through the sliding glass door, bouncing off a flagging welcome home balloon hanging behind the couch.<br /><br /><br /><br />While a typical Sunday should have involved a run or a long bike ride, today Christa is focused on more manageable tasks like household chores. Taking a break, she sits down on the couch, picks up her laptop, logs on, and then notices her cat settling down comfortably on the floor in front of her. It's impossible, she thinks to herself. There's no way the cat can be sitting right there--my foot is supposed to be there.<br /><br /><br /><br />Supposed to be. Christa is now an amputee, her right leg missing from the shin down. And every now and then, she almost forgets.<br /><br /><br /><br />Christa's life was transformed during what is being described as the worst natural disaster in recent history. The 7.0 magnitude earthquake in and around the densely populated capital of Port-Au-Prince, Haiti, claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and affected millions of others. Christa was among those who narrowly survived.<br /><br /><br /><br />Christa had traveled to Haiti in early January with her brother Julian, 27, a volunteer with Heads Together Haiti, a literacy and environmental organization. He needed her help designing a retaining wall in a rural town just outside the city; the wall would be a barrier to help protect the town from the flooding caused by hurricanes. Christa was eager to spend some quality time with Julian, so it hadn't taken much convincing to get her to go, and she was perfect for the job: She was a Ph.D. student at Arizona State University, working on a degree in sustainability, the study of international development, infrastructure, water resources, and climate change. This wasn't the first time she'd volunteered her time abroad. Before studying civil engineering as an undergrad, she'd spent four months in Guatemala teaching English and math at an orphanage. This strong sense of purpose had been instilled in Christa and her siblings by their parents, who raised them in Alaska in the Quaker tradition, a religion that emphasizes selflessness and social justice.<br /><br /><br /><br />Christa was also in great physical shape to take on the challenge. She had been involved in sports her whole life, and athleticism runs deep in her soul: ""If I'm not moving, I'm not being,"" she says. After completing her undergrad degree, she had taken a year off to rock climb, her true passion. She loves everything about it--the feel of the rocks, the soaring heights, even the inevitable falls. ""Falling is the closest you can get to flying. I know the rope isn't going to break,"" she says. An accomplished climber, she had been featured in several climbing magazines and had just run her first half marathon.<br /><br /><br /><br />On the warm, quiet morning of January 12, Christa and her brother were visiting a friend. ""Earlier, Julian and I had walked an hour and a half up the mountainside to help with medical relief for a different project,"" says Christa. ""We were walking back down, and we went to someone's house that had an Internet connection."" The two sat down, and Julian was just opening his laptop when the building began to shake. Christa dropped the book she was holding and began to run, following Julian toward the staircase. The rumbling turned to wild shaking, the walls lost their purpose, and the floors began to give way. Julian stopped beneath a metal door frame to protect himself, but Christa didn't make it as far. She fell and found herself pinned under a large concrete slab.<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Her first instinct was a learned one: Cover your head and protect your neck from further falling debris. Earthquake drills were commonplace in her Alaskan school, so she knew to shield herself and wait. After what seemed like endless commotion (though in reality, the initial jolt lasted less than a minute), everything stopped and Christa found herself part of the destruction and devastation.<br /><br /><br /><br />The next 48 hours, while harrowing, went quickly. It took about an hour and a half for Julian and their friend Gerald Lumarque to pry out her leg, which had been jammed under the concrete slab at a 90-degree angle. They used their hands, and then a pickax. As Christa lay there, thoughts raced through her mind: Will I live? If so, will I ever walk again? Will I still have the life I've dreamed of? She thought about her family, about other rock climbers who had survived accidents, about her boyfriend back home, Ethan. She thought about everything and anything to take the focus off her leg. Shock set in, and her pain--which should have been unbearable--was deferred until much later. ""I felt like I was losing circulation in my leg because a house was sitting on top of it,"" she says. ""I didn't realize I was so injured--I just thought my leg had fallen asleep.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Once Christa's leg was freed, Gerald and another Haitian friend, Wenson Georges, sped her by motorcycle through Port-Au-Prince, Wenson holding her like an infant in his arms. ""I was mostly worried that my leg would get caught in the motorcycle's chain,"" says Christa. ""This was also probably the period when I saw the most destruction and raw chaos, because the dust hadn't even settled. Everyone was still digging out of buildings and figuring out what had happened."" They heard that the hospital closest to them had collapsed, so they took Christa to the only medical facility they could find, an army base, where soldiers from the Sri Lanka Army tended to her.<br /><br /><br /><br />There was little chance of saving her foot, but medics tried anyway. They bandaged her leg, gave her fluids, and kept her fever down. Wenson spent the night by her side, outdoors (""There were a few hundred badly injured Haitians there too,"" she says), as soldiers stabilized her leg and prepped her for the next flight out of Haiti.<br /><br /><br /><br />It wasn't until she awoke in a Miami hospital after her first surgery that the true pain and reality set in. Christa had always judged pain on a scale of 1 to 10, but ever since being injured in the earthquake, her old 10 is now her new 2. ""I remember holding on to the rail of the bed while they were pulling off the dressing after I came out of surgery,"" she says. ""I remember sweating. I remember how I was reacting as the doctors pulled the bandages off my leg in the most excruciating manner you can think of. It was horrible pain.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Lying there in that hospital bed, she wondered, Does my boyfriend even know where I am? And if so, will he still want to be with me in my condition? Christa had met Ethan, now 29, when they were both graduate students at Columbia University in New York City; they were avid rock climbers and spent many weekends climbing together in upstate New York. Their relationship continued over the next three and a half years, Ethan living in New York, Christa living in Arizona--both studying, rock climbing to unwind, and hoping to one day reside in the same city and make a life together. As coincidence would have it, Ethan's graduate work involves the study of mathematical tools for seismologists, scientists who analyze earthquakes. He receives an e-mail every time a major earthquake hits somewhere on the globe. On January 12, an e-mail alerted him that an earthquake had hit Haiti, not far from where his girlfriend was working.<br /><br /><br /><br />Christa was lying in a hospital room in Miami, two hours out of emergency surgery, when Ethan rushed in, panic dripping from his sleepless face. ""He'd been in constant contact with my parents,"" she says, and as soon as they heard she'd been put on a plane to Miami, he caught the next possible flight out of New York. A month earlier, Ethan and Christa had decided they'd wait to get married until they were both living in the same city at the same time. But that morning in the hospital room, ""he told me the past two days had been the worst of his life, bar none,"" says Christa. He proposed on the spot, and she said yes.<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>A month and four surgeries later, Christa and Ethan returned home to Arizona. She had to start rehab and get back to school. He moved in with her, working on his graduate school dissertation from afar and conferring with his advisors over the phone.<br /><br /><br /><br />Christa's right leg was fitted for a temporary prosthesis, but in the spring, while she awaited a more permanent one, she had to amble around on crutches. It took an hour longer to do just about anything. Instead of one trip around the kitchen to get breakfast, now it took three: one for milk, one for cereal, one for a bowl and spoon. Open fridge, balance on crutch, grab milk, rebalance on crutch, shut fridge, hobble to table with milk, repeat for cereal, repeat for bowl and spoon. Laundry became a multistep task, as did showering. And because she was still getting used to her new body, she'd occasionally find herself helpless. ""I could stand without my crutches,"" she says, ""and every so often I'd be standing somewhere and I'd pick something up and not have my crutches and realize, I'm stuck! I can't go anywhere.""<br /><br /><br /><br />The need to adapt extends to greater physical activities as well. For a while, the only approved exercise was swimming, one of the few she'd never really done. ""When I was growing up in Alaska, the only swimming I knew was, 'This is a life jacket. Put it on.' I could keep my head above water and doggie paddle, but I couldn't swim.""<br /><br /><br /><br />A friend showed her the basics, and now Christa swims at a local pool to keep her cardio strength up and her weight down. Her prosthesis is custom-made to specific measurements, including a set body weight so the amount of pressure placed on her right leg won't be disrupted. If her weight fluctuates too much, she may be forced to get a new prosthesis, which can cost upwards of $20,000. For the girl who had run a half marathon before leaving for Haiti and who biked everywhere and hiked as often as she could, this meant buying a scale for the first time in her life.<br /><br /><br /><br />In Christa's dreams at night, she's an able-bodied person, not an amputee: ""When I dream, I still have two feet, I'm running around school and trying to get my papers in on time, or I'm rock climbing or swimming."" She has dreamed about Haiti only a few times, but each time she does, it's about the country itself, not the catastrophe that struck. Perhaps that's because when she's awake, her thoughts are less about the past and more about the future. Christa is a survivor and a fighter. She refuses to feel sorry for herself, although she does have some survivor's guilt. ""I believe I'm alive because I'm American,"" she says. ""I mean, I might have survived if I were Haitian--if I had medical care and hadn't gotten infected and had a family that had food, maybe I could have survived. It's unlikely. But I certainly wouldn't be as healthy as I am now. I was lucky: I wasn't stuck for very long, I made it to Miami, I had health insurance, none of the rest of me was really injured.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Despite her amazing recovery, Christa has been forced to slow way down and take in the moments in life she once raced past, even the mundane and common ones. She is slowly planning her wedding--and for the honeymoon, she and Ethan plan to go on a rock-climbing excursion in Thailand. Eventually, she wants to rejoin her brother in Haiti. (Doctors are waiting for the swelling to reduce and for Christa's skin to fully heal around the amputation site before fitting her with her permanent prosthesis).<br /><br /><br /><br />In the meantime, she has managed to gain enough strength to again dangle from a rope on the side of a mountain. About a month after the quake, even before she got her first prosthesis, she scaled the wall in a climbing gym. On March 12, exactly two months after the quake, she went ice climbing. By mid-June, she was rock climbing in the Jemez Mountains in New Mexico, where she spent most of the summer doing research.<br /><br /><br /><br />These amazing feats are thanks in large part to prosthetist Michael Pack. ""He has been the most important part of my recovery and my return to a normal life,"" says Christa. ""There are two parts to a below-knee prosthetic leg: the socket--the part my leg sits in--and the foot. I can switch the feet out for different sports or to wear different shoes. Eventually, I'll have many prosthetic feet. I can have them for ice and rock climbing, biking, walking, running, and hiking. In many ways, climbing is easier for me than walking. It's still the same sport, just a different set of moves.""<br /><br /><br /><br />What happened in Haiti may have interrupted Christa's progress in crossing items off her life's to-do list, but she's back on track now: She wants to finish her Ph.D., master going down stairs without taking them one step at a time like a toddler, and continue working with the organization she helped create, Christa's Angels (see ""Helping Christa's Heroes,"" page 139), an initiative to support friends and colleagues in the town where she and Julian were working. And of course, there's that special stroll down the aisle. ""I'm definitely going with the long, white dress,"" says Christa, with a laugh. And she will definitely be walking.<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p>",

""This can include plunging deeply into a partner with a great deal of vigor and railing against the pubic bone.""</p><p>When looking at the <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/the-male-body"">male body</a> you'll see that the penis has two chambers of sponge called the corpora cavernosa. The thick membrane that surrounds this erectile tissue can tear when there's a powerful thrust. The result? A ""cracking"" sound, an immediate loss of erection, and probably a loud cry of pain coming from the unfortunate owner of the now ""fractured"" penis. Pain and a great deal of bruising may follow.</p><p>""The penis may be 'bent' to one side or the other,"" says Fulbright. ""In major cases, his urethra can be damaged, which affects his ability to urinate.""</p><p>Who's at risk?

But a strict eating plan--whether self-imposed or stemming from a popular program--isn't always the answer. </p><p>One study published in the journal <i>American Psychologist</i> reviewed all previous research that tracked dieters for 2 to 5 years and found that at least one- to two-thirds of dieters regained all the weight they lost (plus some) within 5 years. Other studies show that strict dieting triggers people to eat more than those who aren't on any diet, creating a vicious cycle of undereating and overindulging.

""Losing weight isn't just about physical activity and it isn't just about cognitive skills like counting calories, weighing portions, or not stocking junk in your pantry,"" says Alan Kristal, Ph.D., researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and co-author of the yoga study mentioned above. ""If you're going to lose weight and keep it up, you need to be mindful in addition to these things."" </p><p>In fact, there's been a surge of programs that promise weight-loss success based on a mindful approach to eating. These programs encourage people to weigh their hunger levels against emotions, such as anxiety, loneliness, or anger, to make sure they are eating for the right reasons. So rather than chomping on chips to tame tension or reduce stress, you can learn to calm your body and mind with meditation and deep breathing. ""Mindfulness gives people a better sense of control over food and makes eating a more comfortable experience,"" says Donald Altman, author of Meal by Meal: 365 Daily Meditations for Finding Balance Through Mindful Eating. The same techniques you use to stay focused and breathe through a challenging pose during yoga class can come in handy when you're in the kitchen or a restaurant. Since yoga practitioners feel more in tune with their bodies, they are responsive to their body's sensations--including hunger and satiety. When you're more aware of why you're eating or not eating, you could lose weight almost by accident.</p><p>An avid yoga practitioner himself, Kristal developed a scale to measure mindful eating, and his research found that the longer individuals practice yoga, the higher they score on the mindful eating scale. And high mindful-eating marks were strongly correlated with a low body mass index (BMI). Want to slim down mindfully? Here's how <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.slimcalmsexyyoga.com/?keycode=142685"">yoga</a> can help.</p><p><b>Yoga helps you bear discomfort without reacting to it. </b><br />A good yoga teacher will put you in awkward, tough postures--think <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/revolved-triangle-pose""><b>revolved triangle pose (parivrtta trikonasana)</b></a> and <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/king-pigeon-pose""><b>one-legged king pigeon pose (eka pada rajakapotasana)</b></a>--and ask you to stay there. Rather than grit your teeth, hold your breath, and curse your guru, yoga trains you to observe the tension in your body and the wandering of your mind and use your breath to coax both open. That is, tolerate your suffering as is. You can apply this same technique to other uncomfortable situations, such as an intense craving for ice cream or fries. </p><p>""I suggested one of my program participants try sitting with her feelings instead of eating junk food when she was unhappy,"" Altman says. ""The next time she had a craving, she drove into a fast-food restaurant's parking lot and sat in her car for 40 minutes. She realized that she had never given her unhappiness a name. That day she realized she was lonely and that a burger and fries wouldn't make that feeling go away.""<br /></p><p><b><br />Yoga teaches you to de-stress--on the spot.</b><br />Breathing deeply into your belly has an immediate calming effect on your mind, which is why pranayama is useful when we start freaking out in the middle of <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/half-moon-modified""><b>half moon pose (ardha chandrasana)</b></a>. We normally take spills when we're worrying about losing balance. Concentrating on your breath clears your head so you can align yourself deliberately. Similarly, if you don't manage stress, it can drive you to make poor choices, Altman says. That's why, when high anxiety induces a fight-or-flight response in your brain, you might zoom to the fridge or vending machine to divert yourself from mental anguish. Taking a pause with a deep breath during challenging portions of your day can help you take a detour from the Doritos. Try this breathing exercise the next time you need to center yourself.</p><p>Moon-piercing breath: This exercise has a calming effect on the body and the mind. It can be done at the beginning of a yoga practice or whenever you need to calm down.<br />Sit at the front of your mat in a comfortable cross-legged position. Allow your eyes to close, ground your tailbone to the floor, and lengthen upward through the crown of your head. Lift your right hand to your face. Place the tips of your index and middle fingers on the space between your eyebrows. Direct your focus there as you breathe.<br />Block your right nostril with your thumb and inhale through the left nostril.<br />Block your left nostril with your ring finger, pause a second, and then exhale through the right. Repeat, breathing slowly and deeply from the left side to the right for 10 to 20 rounds of inhale and exhale. </p><p><b>Yoga coaches us to change.<br /></b><br />Think about your very first, second, or third <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/downward-facing-dog-pose""><b>downward-facing dog pose (adho mukha svanasana)</b></a> and how fluid it has become in your practice. Yoga can cultivate the confidence needed to take a step toward change in general, such as making healthier food choices. ""We create new neural networks in our brain every time we do something unfamiliar,"" Altman says. ""It gives us hope that we can eat a meal and approach it in an entirely new way--and that helps us keep at it.""</p>",

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/women-and-alcohol,Health,15,28,13,3,0,6,0,0,,Women and Alcohol,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0911-drinks-on-table.jpg,"<p>Samantha* rang in the big 3-0 with endless rounds of vodka tonics and overflowing flutes of bubbly. Wearing a bright blue dress that set off her strawberry-blonde hair, the single optometrist wove through the Manhattan bar with the grace of a slalom skier rounding gates, boisterously greeting friends as they arrived. Before she could finish a drink, another one would be placed in her hand. Samantha giggled, flirted, and danced to the beats of Lady Gaga and old-school Madonna until nearly sunrise, when she finally poured herself into bed.</p><p>Samantha may have justified her night of excessive drinking as a milestone celebration, but ask any group of women why they drink, and the answers you're likely to get will be as varied as their cocktails of choice: to unwind, to de-stress, to feel confident, to have fun, to sleep, to loosen up, to forget. <a href=""/health/what-you-should-know-about-alcohol"">Alcohol indulgence</a> crosses all geographical, racial, and economic boundaries. In a survey in the <i>Journal of Studies on Alcohol</i>, 80 percent of women ages 21 to 40 reported that they drink-a significant increase over 10 years ago. And most aren't just sipping a single glass with dinner. Nearly 63 percent of women ages 21 to 34 report binge drinking (defined as downing five or more alcoholic beverages on a single occasion), according to recent research from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that drinking too much has serious mental and physical consequences. ""It can send people hurtling down a dangerous path toward psychological dependence and depression while raising the risk for <a href=""/health/foods-that-lower-your-cancer-risk"">cancer</a>, heart disease, liver damage, and more,"" says Samir Zakhari, Ph.D., director of the Division of Metabolism and Health Effects at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA).</p><p><b>Stress Elixir </b><br />What's behind the uptick in imbibing? ""A common reason women say they drink is to <a href=""/nutrition/stress-busting-foods"">ease stress</a>,"" says Suniya Luthar, Ph.D., a psychologist at Teachers College at Columbia University. Working women claim they need a cocktail to take the edge off at the end of the day; mothers seek an escape from their babies' unrelenting needs; college students crave a break from studying. </p><p>""Today it's more difficult than ever to get into good schools, and it's tougher to get and keep jobs,"" says psychologist Carrie Wilkens, Ph.D., cofounder and clinical director of the Center for Motivation and Change in New York City. ""So many women live a pressure-cooker existence; [that lifestyle] helps to explain why heavy drinking is on the rise.""</p><p>Alcohol does, in fact, work as a relaxation catalyst-at least in the short term. <a href=""/nutrition/beneficial-effects-of-alcohol"">Drinking in moderation</a> can depress the central nervous system, slow the heart rate, and quiet mental chatter. ""As soon as I take a sip, I feel my brain begin to turn off, and I can just let go of the day,"" Samantha says.</p><p>Tracy,* 38, who has a 3-year-old son, says downing a few glasses of wine or an icy beer at day's end is a way for her to seamlessly switch gears. ""When I drink with my husband we're more flirtatious and less apt to talk only about our son. I immediately feel a sense of calm creep in. It's a joyful, relaxed feeling I look forward to at night.""</p><p>Last year, Tracy started Mommy Drinks, a neighborhood social club of about 30 mothers who meet up at a local bar, sans children, on the first Friday of every month. ""I used to push my son's stroller past this bar and see everyone inside having a good time,"" she recalls. ""I thought, 'Why can't I be in there, too?'""</p><p>Which gets at another reason women tie one on: It's a way for them to connect. ""Women are more motivated by social incentives to drink than men are,"" Wilkens says. ""Alcohol can make you less self-conscious and willing to be silly and funny. Women tend to rely on alcohol to help them forge friendships, especially when they're in the midst of a transition, like moving or starting a new job.""</p><p><b>DUI: Dating Under the Influence</b><br />Alcohol plays an integral role in many women's romantic relationships, often from day one. ""Young women I've talked to have a very difficult time imagining going on a date without a couple of drinks,"" Wilkens says. ""Many of them are so used to texting or e-mailing that they get nervous with face-to-face interactions."" Samantha, who typically meets guys on dating websites, says: ""I had one date where we met for coffee, and I felt very exposed. I am far more comfortable when the lights are turned down low and there's a glass of wine sitting in front of me."" </p><p>Downing drinks may also be a method women use to level the playing field with male peers. ""During my freshman year in college, I met a lot of girls who took pride in telling guys, 'Hey, I can outdrink you,'"" says Katie,* a 21-year-old senior at Indiana University. ""I found that guys were attracted to girls who could take whiskey shots and beat them at drinking games."" In fact, when researchers at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles surveyed more than 3,000 undergrads, they found that 26 percent of the female respondents thought men were most likely to be friends with a woman who drinks five or more drinks at a time.</p><p><b>Sobering Health News</b><br />Despite their bravado, women are at a disadvantage when it comes to withstanding the effects of alcohol. Even if equally matched in size, a woman's higher body fat percentage and lower water content means she'll get intoxicated faster than a man. Women also suffer the health consequences of frequent drinking, such as liver disease, more quickly than guys do. </p><p>""Drinking to excess is one area where it's very dangerous for women to compete with men,"" Wilkens says. Binge drinking raises your risk of high blood pressure, stroke, and brain damage and increases the chances that you'll contract an STD or have an unintended pregnancy.</p><p>It's also associated with being obese or overweight-not surprising, she points out, considering that the average mixed drink has 300 calories. Knocking back three adds almost 1,000 calories to your <a href=""/nutrition/liquid-sugar-intake"">daily caloric intake</a>.</p><p>Even the stress-relieving aspect of alcohol has a downside once you blow past the two-drink mark. ""Alcohol raises levels of cortisol and adrenaline, the hormones that are released when you're stressed,"" Zakhari says. In other words, though a cocktail may seem like a one-way ticket to the Land of Ahhs, it's a temporary trip. When the buzz wears off, the heightened cortisol and adrenaline make you feel even more overwhelmed than before. And that's not taking into account the lingering effects of a hangover.</p><p>But what about the headlines proclaiming that the occasional alcoholic beverage is good for your health? Moderate alcohol consumption (for women, one drink a day) has been shown to decrease the risk of coronary artery disease and diabetes, and it may slow the onset of dementia. A new study in the journal Nutrition finds that female beer drinkers have better bone density than nondrinkers. Another new study, published this year in <i>The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Journal</i>, explained how resveratrol, a natural anti-inflammatory compound in red wine, could eventually be used to treat diseases as diverse as sepsis (a life-threatening overreaction to an infection) and atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).</p><p>However, the promising health news may simply be attributed to the fact that compared with teetotalers or excessive drinkers, those who drink in moderation also tend to be wealthier, better educated, and more physically fit and have greater access to health care, says Tim Naimi, M.D., an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Confusing matters more is a watershed study published earlier this year in the <i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i> that revealed a connection between alcohol and cancer. Even moderate drinking raises cancer risk by an alarming degree. Researchers followed more than a million women for an average of seven years and found that regularly having just one drink per day increased their chances of common forms of cancer including those of the breast, rectum, liver, esophagus, oral cavity, and pharynx. For example, one daily drink upped breast cancer risk by 12 percent. ""Family history increases breast cancer risk by about 60 percent, so having about five drinks a day raises your risk by the same amount as if your mother had the disease,"" says lead study author Naomi Allen, Ph.D., of the University of Oxford.</p><p>The bottom line when it comes to alcohol's pros and cons: The jury is still out. The National Institutes of Health aren't ready to say that women shouldn't drink as a result of just one study (however scary it may be). So if you already drink, keeping to the one-drink-per-day limit is still generally considered safe, provided that you don't have a family history of serious diseases like alcoholism or depression. And in light of the most recent studies, experts also say that women who are carriers of the BRCA gene mutations should consider abstaining.</p><p>Says Sharon Wilsnack, Ph.D., a psychologist at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences who has studied women's imbibing behaviors for decades: ""Keeping your drinking in check will protect your physical health- and it can also improve your entire well-being.""</p><p>*<i>Source's name has been changed.<br /></i></p>",Celebrities

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-and-food-cravings,Weight Loss,31,28,7,6,0,115,0,0,,Got a Craving?,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0610-mind-over-1161.jpg,"<p>You already know the secret to <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss"">women's weight loss</a>: Eat fewer calories than you burn and you'll be zipping up those size 4 jeans in no time. So why aren't we all as svelte as Heidi Klum? Because lasting weight loss has little to do with crunching numbers. ""In focusing on calories in and calories out, the field of nutrition has ignored the most critical variable: behavioral and cognitive changes,"" says Stephen Gullo, Ph.D., a weight-loss expert in New York City. <br /><br />In other words, if you don't want to fall headfirst off the diet wagon the next time Mom rips into your new haircut, you have to retrain your brain. ""To deal with unhealthy eating behaviors, we must challenge the thoughts, feelings, and cues that have been built up over a lifetime,"" says Cynthia M. Bulik, Ph.D., the Jordan Distinguished Professor of Eating Disorders at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Not to get too Freudian, but many doctors and weight-loss experts say that permanently altering your waistline means permanently altering your relationship with food. <br /><br />That means recognizing and curbing <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/stress-busting-foods"">emotional eating</a>, of course-and exploiting your psychological makeup to make healthy eating easier. Behavioral psychologists have found that changing your negative thoughts, one by one, can eventually create a habit of positive thinking. It's the same with eating. And with the tips and exercises here, you won't have to lie on a leather couch to learn how.</p><p></p><br /><b>Figure Out What the Heck You're Feeling</b><br /><br />Do your pants start pinching after a big fight with your boyfriend? It's normal: Women tend to use food for comfort. A University of Minnesota study found that we are almost twice as likely as men to binge when we're <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/yoga/meditation-fights-depression-and-stress?page=2"">depressed</a>, though researchers aren't sure why exactly. What they do know, according to research in the journal <i>Physiology & Behavior,</i> is that what women choose to fill up on is usually loaded with sugar, because eating carb-heavy foods temporarily boosts levels of serotonin-a brain chemical that regulates mood. ""There are many ways people respond to difficult emotions,"" says Kelly D. Brownell, Ph.D., director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University. ""Some people drink, some take drugs, and some eat.""<br /><br />So the next time you feel like mainlining a pint of mint chocolate chip, stop, take a step back, and ask yourself: What's my emotional state right now? And why? For example: ""I'm humiliated because my boss embarrassed me during a staff meeting."" Write that down, along with a list of things-unrelated to ice cream-that you can do to make yourself feel better anytime you're angry, sad, or anxious. Maybe you could quietly confront the person who told the whole world that you let one rip during a headstand in yoga class. Other good alternatives: hopping on your bike, going to see the latest Vince Vaughn flick, carving jack-o'-lanterns with the kids. Keep this list with you so you'll have it the next time the lady at the checkout counter asks you when the baby's due.<br /><br /><b>Spot Food Frenemies</b><br /><br />Experts have found that the same people and situations can trigger emotional eating time and time again. Ann Kearney-Cooke, Ph.D., director of the Cincinnati Psychotherapy Institute and author of <i>Change Your Mind, Change Your Body,</i> suggests asking yourself these four questions: Who are the three people I'm closest to? How do I eat before, after, and while I'm with them? What are my expectations of them? (For example, is my boyfriend there for me when I'm having a crappy day and need someone to talk to? Does he turn off the TV when I want to spend time together without <i>The Simpsons</i>?) Finally, what can I do when these people don't meet my expectations without straying from my weight-loss plan? You may find that you're infuriated when your mom calls you during a busy workday to ""chat"" or that you always feel guilted into meeting your best friend over margaritas. Once you recognize these things, strategize accordingly: Screen your calls so you can call your mother back when you have a free moment, or ask your friend if you can do a late dinner in lieu of happy hour. <br /><br /><b>Track Your Thoughts</b><br /><br />Here's a shocker: The way you feel about yourself strongly affects how successful you are at weight loss. ""People who are trying to lose weight are often held back by negative core beliefs about themselves, their capabilities, their attractiveness, and their worth as human beings,"" says Rene D. Zweig, Ph.D., director of the American Institute for Cognitive Therapy's eating disorders and weight management program in New York City. <br /><br />Challenge these beliefs with an exercise that Dr. Zweig gives her patients-it sounds cheesy, but it works. Write ""I am"" 20 times along the left side of a sheet of paper, then fill in the blanks. Answers can vary from positive things (""I am good at making people laugh"") to negative ones (""I am an unlovable cow""). Take out the list every night and write down something that happened that day that's inconsistent with each negative statement. For example, for ""I am a failure at work,"" write ""I met all my deadlines today."" Doing this exercise every day for a week will show you that the facts just don't support your beliefs. Continuing to challenge the negative thoughts about yourself with little reality checks will do wonders for your self-esteem (and your waistline). <br /><br /><b>Keep a Food Diary.</b><br /><br />To change your eating habits you have to know what they are. A handful of Junior Mints, the three slices of provolone you ate over the sink-all those calories add up. ""At the end of the day, many people have no clue what they ate or why they ate it,"" says Robert F. Kushner, M.D., medical director of Northwestern Memorial Hospital's Wellness Institute. <br /><br />Writing down what you eat is one of the most effective ways to control your weight, plain and simple. Record every morsel that passes your lips-from your morning coffee to the free hors d'oeuvre sample you snagged at the supermarket. Write down the time of day you ate it, plus what you were doing before and afterward. The point of all this anal behavior? You'll start noticing patterns that you can easily fix. For example, if you find yourself drawn to the vending machine at 3 P.M. every day, you may realize you just want something to kick you out of your afternoon slump. Go for a short walk instead-it can have the same pick-me-up effect as a Twinkie. <br /><br /><b>Stop Multitasking </b><br /><br />""Eating should be an activity in itself,"" Dr. Kushner says. In other words, not something you should do while you're reading, typing up a memo, or watching <i>Entourage.</i> It takes the brain 15 to 20 minutes to register signs of fullness, so slow down and focus. Really take the time to taste and chew your food. Try eating with your nondominant hand and putting your fork down between bites. Make the meal last at least 20 minutes, and when you feel satisfied, stop. Take these steps and we guarantee you'll eat less than if you'd scarfed your BLT between e-mails. <br /><br /><b>Use Your Inner Eye</b><br /><br />""We know from sports psychology that when people visualize themselves changing a behavior, it's more likely to happen,"" Dr. Kearney-Cooke says. So before heading to your grandma's (where there are enough pastries to feed the Dallas Cowboys), visualize Granny's sweet spread-and her insistence that you dig in. Then prepare yourself to say something like: ""They look delicious, Gran, but I'm here to see you."" Once you've got your plan down, you'll be better able to survive Thanksgiving dinner or your friend's bridal shower unscathed. <br /><br /><b>Don't Get too Hungry</b><br /><br />""Recognizing hunger and fullness cues is essential,"" Dr. Bulik says. If you eat when you're moderately hungry, not ravenous, you'll be less likely to inhale that box of Ding Dongs. To figure out what ""moderately hungry"" means, give your hunger level a numerical value between 1 (not hungry) and 10 (could eat a dirty sneaker) and eat only when you're between 5 and 7. <br /><br />To avoid level-10 hunger, eat on schedule. ""One of the principal predictors of failure at weight control is skipping meals and not establishing a regular pattern of eating,"" Dr. Gullo says. The first reason is physiological-the body functions more efficiently if you eat every 3 to 4 hours. The second is psychological-skipping breakfast can lead to thoughts like: ""I didn't eat this morning, so I can have this giant piece of cake."" Every night, write down in your food journal the times you're going to eat the next day (say, 7 a.m., 10 a.m, 1 p.m., 4 p.m., and 7 p.m.). Then stick to that plan like white on rice-over time it will become a habit. <br /><br /><b>Wait Out Temptation.</b><br /><br />Studies show that when it comes to food cravings, the mind is easily distracted. Remember that the next time you think the only thing that will ease your discomfort during an awkward dinner with your husband's family is one of his mom's honey buns. ""In the moment, people think their craving will last forever-or at least until they eat the food,"" Dr. Zweig says. ""In reality, 5 minutes is long enough for many people to forget they had the craving in the first place."" Set a timer, then pick up that half-knitted scarf, take a bubble bath, or do a Sudoku puzzle.<br /><br /><b>Relax</b><br /><br />It's no secret that stress can make you tear through the cupboards faster than Lance Armstrong on race day. ""When the demands in your life are really high and your resources to deal with them are low, your eating habits can suffer,"" Dr. Kearney-Cooke says. Taking time to unwind is just as important as dieting to your weight-loss efforts. Set aside some time each day (even 10 minutes helps) for a little mental vacation: Make a massage appointment, read the tabloids, or just sit somewhere quiet and breathe. Go to bed an hour earlier, too. Studies show that those who don't get enough sleep eat more than those who get their 8 hours. Why? Being short on shut-eye can alter your levels of appetite-regulating hormones like ghrelin and leptin-so you mistake feeling fatigued for feeling famished. <br /><br /><b>Reward Yourself</b><br /><br />Dr. Gullo believes it takes-gulp-a full year for dietary changes to really sink in: ""Success at weight loss is, in some ways, like overcoming a loss. When a loved one dies, you have to get through that first birthday, summer vacation, and holiday season without the person. When changing your lifestyle, you have to get through that whole cycle without your old habits."" <br /><br />So take it slowly, and give yourself a big pat on the back for meeting mini goals as you go. For example, promise to buy yourself that pair of pink Pumas you've been coveting if you manage to dodge your doughnut cravings for a week. ""Don't fall into the trap of thinking you don't deserve a new outfit until you've lost weight,"" Dr. Zweig says. Get those jeans now, even if they aren't a size 4. <br /><p></p>","healthy eating,Eating Strategies"

And if it's this difficult now, imagine what it's going to be like in 10, 20, 30 years. But before you begin planning your future as a wobbly, overweight hunchback, understand that getting in the shape of your life for the rest of your life doesn't have to be daunting.<br /><br />In fact, if you find your fitness workout groove now, you'll set yourself up for success in the future. Studies show that working out may lower a woman's risk of <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/surviving-breast-cancer"">breast cancer</a> by 37 percent, osteoporosis by 45 percent, and <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/heart-health-3"">heart disease</a> by 14 percent. So we tapped dozens of doctors and fitness experts to find out exactly what you should do to add years to your life.<br /><br />The bottom line: Whether you're fresh out of college or funding Junior's tuition, the moment to launch your lifetime fitness plan is now. Then simply adjust your total-body workouts throughout the years to give your muscles, bones, and heart what they need to keep working well enough to keep up with you.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/total-body-workout-2""><b>RELATED: The Best Workout for Your 30s!</b></a><br /><br /><b>Fate Says: Your Stamina is Flagging </b><br />Over the next 10 years, lazy ladies will lose up to 6 percent of their aerobic capacity. Good thing you're not one of them. Put your lungs and heart to work now-and in the decades to come-and you'll be an oxygen queen forever.<br /><br /><b>Cheat Fate: Do Integral Intervals </b><br />Those sprints you dreaded in high school are your BFF these days. Try this <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/running-to-lose-weight#axzz1l5CPUAa6"">interval workout</a>: Warm up with 5 minutes of walking. Next, sprint for 30 seconds, trying to reach 90 percent of your best effort. Then walk or jog lightly for 90 seconds. Repeat this sprint cycle 10 times. To make it harder, reduce your 90-second rest period.<br /><br /><b>Fate Says: Zero Time, Zapped Motivation</b><br />When researchers at Toronto General Hospital asked women in their 30s why they didn't exercise, 40 percent said they didn't have the time. Another 40 percent said they didn't have the willpower.

University of Tennessee researchers found that women who took at least 10,000 steps per day had 9 percent less body fat by the time they were 50 than those who took between 6,000 and 9,999 steps. If you go for regular walks, try to add more steps in the same amount of time; you'll automatically improve your fitness level without increasing your exercise time.<br /><br />If you're coming up short of 10,000 steps, start making small changes: Next time you go to the grocery store, carry only one bag inside the house at a time. (And try not to unpack the Baked Lays between the car and the kitchen.)<br /><br /><b>Fate Says: Your Back Is A Royal Pain</b><br />About 70 percent of women will report lower back pain at some point in their lives, and it often starts at age 30. During pregnancy, as many as 80 percent of women experience <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/yoga/yoga-poses-for-back-pain"">back pain</a>.<br /><br />The key to preventing it is not just muscular strength but endurance, too. ""Your back muscles don't need to be overly strong to support your spine; they need to be able to support it for long periods of time,"" says Lori Incledon, author of <em>Strength Training for Women</em>. In other words, it's about how much force those muscles can exert as well as how long they can go before pooping out.<br /><br />That's doubly important when you're expecting because your abdominal muscles stretch to make room for your growing uterus and can't support you the way they usually do, which forces your lower back to bear the brunt. Not to mention your levels of the hormone relaxin are on the rise, loosening not only your pelvic ligaments (get that baby outta there!) but also the joints of your spine.<br /><br /><b>Cheat Fate: Shore Up Your Core </b><br />Do the <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/side-plank-2?workout=23236"">side plank</a> three times per week. Lie on your left side with knees straight and upper body propped on your left elbow and forearm. Place your right hand on your right hip and slowly raise your hips until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees. Hold this position for 5 to 10 seconds, breathing deeply. That's one rep. Repeat four times, then switch to your right side. Do one to two sets for each side.<br /><br />If that's too hard, bend your knees 90 degrees so that they rest on the floor. If you're pregnant, do the exercise with your back against a wall for support.<br /> </p><p> </p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/?keycode=197495&cm_mmc=whcom-_-edit-_-lookbetternaked""></a></p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/?keycode=197495&cm_mmc=whcom-_-edit-_-lookbetternaked""><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/images/Look-Better-Naked.jpg"" /><br /><br /></a> <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/?keycode=197495&cm_mmc=whcom-_-edit-_-lookbetternaked""><b><i>Look Better Naked</i> at Any Age!</b></a><p></p><p> </p>","healthy-30s,You and Improved"

But it turns out there's another hidden cancer contributor that occupies much of our daily lives: sitting.</p><p>In a study published in the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em>, researchers report that people who spend more hours of the day sitting have up to a 66 percent higher risk of developing certain types of cancer than those who aren't as sedentary.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://healthland.time.com/2012/07/10/get-up-sitting-less-can-add-years-to-your-life/?xid=rodale"">Get Up! Sitting Less Can Add Years to Your Life</a></p><p>These results go beyond the advice by most health professionals for everyone to become more physically active. In reviewing 43 studies in which volunteers were asked about their daily activities and their cancer incidence, the investigators found that the link between sitting and cancer remained strong no matter how physically active the participants were. In other words, even people who worked out regularly but who spent more hours on the couch watching TV, for instance, showed higher rates of cancer than those who didn't sit as much.</p><p>Sedentary behavior was associated with a 24 percent greater risk of developing colon cancer, a 32 percent higher risk of endometrial cancer, and a 21 percent increased risk of lung cancer. When the researchers delved deeper into different types of sedentary habits, they found that watching TV was linked to a 54 percent higher risk of colon cancer and a 66 percent greater risk of endometrial cancer. For every additional two hours that participants spent sitting during the day, their risk of colon cancer rose by eight percent, and their risk of endometrial cancer went up by 10 percent. They didn't find a link between sedentary behavior and other types of cancer, including breast, prostate, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://time.com/8773/now-theres-another-reason-sitting-will-kill-you/?xid=rodale"">Now There's Another Reason Sitting Will Kill You</a></p><p>The findings highlight the difference between being physically active and being sedentary, says Graham Colditz, M.D., of Washington University School of Medicine, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. It's not enough to just be active-it's also important to sit less. But most public health messages aren't stressing the distinction. ""People are not talking about sitting time in the same way as physical activity,"" he says. ""Guidelines say limit the time spent sitting without drilling into how long or what types of sitting they are talking about.""</p><p>The difference is important, especially since the latest research suggests that sitting too much may have its own, independent harms on our health. A recent study, for example, found that people who got up and did light to moderate walking after lunch had lower blood sugar levels and less of a peak in blood sugar than people who didn't get up after eating.</p><p>What's more, sitting can lead to weight gain, and obesity is strongly tied to endometrial cancer. That's because obesity can promote cancer-causing processes such as inflammation and may enhance certain hormones that are linked to tumor formation. Weight gain can also lead to lower levels of vitamin D, and that can raise your risk of colon cancer.</p><p>The authors also point out that TV viewing, in particular, may be associated with higher rates of certain cancers since TV watchers tend to drink more sugary sodas and unhealthy, processed snack foods that can both contribute to obesity and increase exposure to potential food-based cancer-causing agents.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1914450,00.html"">Watching TV: Even Worse for Kids Than You Think</a></p><p>Cutting back on sitting time may not be easy, however, since most office workers tend to sit at a desk in front of computers. But Colditz says there are ways to be less sedentary, either at home or at the office. Try to take breaks every couple of hours to take a quick walk around the halls or to step outside (bathroom breaks don't count). And not eating lunch at your desk can also be a way to schedule a physical break in your day. What you don't want to do, he says, is to make a habit of sitting (in a car or bus or train) on the way to work, sitting at your desk for most of the day, eating lunch at your desk (again, while sitting), and then finally getting up to go home, where you may spend several more hours sitting in front of a TV.</p><p><strong>More from <em>Women's Health</em>: </strong><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/sedentary-lifestyle-hazards"">How Sitting Too Much Can Seriously Endanger Your Health</a> <br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/is-sitting-also-bad-for-your-mental-health"">Is Sitting Also Bad for Your Mental Health?</a> <br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/make-a-change-try-a-standing-desk"">Make a Change: Try a Standing Desk </a></p>","need to know,self care,cancer"

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/barack-obama,Life,18,26,0,1,1,1,0,0,,President Barack Obama's 7 Secrets to Success,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0901-obama-rules.jpg,"<a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/obama-sin-tax"">Barack Obama</a> is about to be tested as never before. But things haven't exactly been easy for him up to now. If George W. Bush was born on third base, Obama was a charter member of the knothole gang: on the outside looking in. His father abandoned the family when Barack was 2, and he and his mother left for Indonesia four years later. At age 10, he moved to Hawaii to live with his grandparents, who sometimes relied on food stamps. And yet that bumpy road delivered him to the presidency of the Harvard Law Review, to the side of a first-lady-in-waiting who is already being compared to Jackie Kennedy, and into a family portrait that includes two of the brightest-eyed little girls ever to cross the public stage. Oh yeah, and it allowed a guy with the middle name Hussein to take over for a president who was obsessed with ridding the earth of Saddam. What does <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/smoking-and-tobacco"">Barack Obama</a> know that the rest of us don't? WH contributing editor Peter Moore met with him last August on his campaign plane to find out. Read on for Obama's flight plan.<br /><br /><br /><b>Lesson 1: Be there for your family, even if you're not around</b><br />I joined the campaign on August 4, which also happened to be Obama's birthday. But <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/michelle-obama-interview"">Michelle Obama</a> and their daughters, Malia and Sasha, were nowhere to be seen.<br /><br />""The birthday celebration was yesterday,"" he said. ""We get everything in, just not always on schedule. I sat on a lounge chair in a friend's backyard, watching my girls and <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/michelle-obamas-workout"">Michelle</a> dance. It was as nice a moment as I've had in a long time. I don't miss the important things. I haven't missed a dance recital. I haven't missed a parent-teacher conference. But there are some things I do miss. Those are trade-offs you make.<br /><br />""I'd like to say that quality time replaces quantity, but sometimes it doesn't. A lot of the best moments of family life happen spontaneously. If you have less time to devote to them, there are fewer of those. What I've been able to do is create a zone of normalcy for my kids. Michelle's been wonderful about that. I have been able to transmit to them my absolute interest in them and my absolute love for them."" <br /><br /><br /><b>Lesson 2: Make the future your focus</b><br />An unavoidable sacrifice: the way a child's life changes under the glare of campaign lights. Obama noted that his daughters were young--5 and 8--when he had to explain the upheaval that was about to shake their family. The girls' first order of business: their now-famous request for a First Dog. ""They did also ask about what they called 'secret people,' which were the Secret Service folks: 'Are we going to have to have those people with sunglasses and earpieces following us around all the time?' And I told them, well, not right away. They've adjusted wonderfully.""<br /><br /><br /><b>Lesson 3: Learn from your father, even if he wasn't a good one</b><br />Citing the complex relationship between Bush I and Bush II, I asked the then-senator if his absent father would have an impact on an Obama presidency. ""I would like to think that most of the issues related to my father have been resolved,"" he replied. ""That's part of what writing <i>Dreams from My Father</i> was about: understanding him, his own personal tragedy. He wasn't a presence in my life; he was an idea that I had to wrestle with for a long time.<br /><br />""Somebody once said that every man is either trying to live up to his dad's expectations or make up for his dad's mistakes. And I'm sure I was doing a little bit of both. But somewhere in my late twenties or early thirties, I sort of figured out what his absence had meant. It's part of what I think has made me a pretty good dad. There's no doubt that it has contributed to my drive. I might not be here had it not been for that absent father prodding me early in life.""<br /><br /><br /><b>Lesson 4: Organize distractions right out of your life</b><br />Clearly, Obama knows how to manage groups. By the time your outfit has its own plane, it had better have a solid pilot.<br /><br />""I'm part of an organization,"" he said, speaking of his campaign team, ""and one of the things I really try to push is to make sure that everybody is focused on the two or three things that are really going to make a difference. I ask them to design my schedule in a way that focuses on being active instead of reactive. <br /><br />""The most difficult thing is to carve out time to think, which is probably the most important time for somebody who's trying to shift an organization, or in this case, the country, as opposed to doing the same things that have been done before. And I find that that time slips away."" <br /><br />His solution: delegate. ""I don't spend a lot of time returning calls or e-mails. If somebody needs something, usually somebody else can handle it. Eliminating TV has been helpful."" <br /><br />But, he confesses, ""I'm still a sucker for <i>SportsCenter</i>."" <br /><br /><br /><b>Lesson 5: Use workout time to focus your mind</b><br />In the epilogue to <i>The Audacity of Hope</i>, Obama recounts how, after a long day in the Senate, he would jog to the Lincoln Memorial, where he'd pull a patriotic Rocky on the steps. Now those head-clearing runs are over: ""One of the things about this job is the loss of anonymity. I can't run outside anymore. Looks like I've got to find other ways to exercise.""<br /><br />Along with impromptu hoops games, Obama follows a six-day workout schedule that alternates cardio and weight training. But fitness is just the side benefit: ""My blood pressure is pretty low, and I tend to be a healthy eater. So I probably could get away with cutting back a little bit. The main reason I work out is just to clear my head and relieve stress. It's a great way to stay focused.""<br /><br /><br /><b>Lesson 6: Quit smoking (as often as you need to)</b><br />For all of Obama's fitness, he's carried around the ultimate health taboo--smoking--for most of his adult life. And he inhaled, alright. Then came word that he'd quit smoking.<br /><br />""There wasn't some dramatic moment,"" he said. ""Michelle had been putting pressure on me for a while. I was never really a heavy smoker--probably at my peak I was smoking seven or eight a day. More typical was three. So it wasn't a huge challenge. There have been a couple of times during the campaign when I fell off the wagon and bummed one, and I had to kick it again.""<br /><br />He does have advice for people wrestling with the dependency. ""Eliminate certain key connections--that first cigarette in the morning, or after a meal, or with a drink. Eliminating those triggers should help.""<br /><br /><br /><b>Lesson 7: If you want to avoid disappointing others, don't disappoint yourself</b><br />No surprise here. It's something Obama has thought about a lot: ""I always try to make sure that my expectations are higher than those of the people around me,"" he says. ""The American people are having a tough time. And I never want people to feel as if I've overpromised to them. I try to explain in a real, honest way how difficult some of the changes will be. But I never want the effect to be that I'm not working as hard as I can on their behalf, that I'm not continually trying to improve. I'm actually glad for the high expectations. One of the interesting things about a campaign is that it really does push you to the limit and then some. And it turns out that you have more in your reservoir than you expected.""<br /><br />",

We set out to uncover the insiders's secrets that will help you get more from your practice. Here's the candid view from the head of the class.</p><p><b>""These mats were last cleaned when the first Bush was president.""</b><br />Fact is, some studios are very diligent about cleaning, and others...not so much. ""I've been working here for years, and I have yet to witness a cleaning of the mats,"" says one New York City instructor. ""If you see dirt on the floors, usually it means the mats aren't as clean,"" says a teacher in California. Buy a mat and unroll your own in <a href=""/life/finding-a-new-yoga-teacher"">yoga class</a>, or follow our NYC teacher's lead: ""If I need to borrow a studio mat, I use those antibacterial wipes to wipe it down first."" </p><p><b>""I'm not your shrink.""</b><br />""People come up to me after class and talk about serious issues like sexual molestation and <a href=""/weight-loss/healthy-success-story"">bulimia</a>,"" says the New York teacher (who like others here did not want to be named). ""I want to support them, but when I'm not qualified, I give them my therapist's number."" Look beyond the so-centered visages and impeccably picked anecdotes and yoga teachers are humans with plenty of their own issues. Like you, they're still working things out.</p><p><b>""I don't get all this chakra stuff myself.""</b><br />Teachers are also on a journey down the yogic path, and may be only a few steps ahead of you. Often their training is based more in the physical than the philosophical. ""Most teachers have a basic understanding of the <i>chakra</i> system, for example, but they're just scratching the surface,"" one says. ""Often they will relearn something right before class."" Look for a teacher who did a 200- to 500-hour certification. Or read up yourself: Try <i>The Heart of Yoga</i> by T.K.V. Desikachar and <i>The Seven Spiritual Laws of Yoga</i> by Deepak Chopra and David Simon. </p><p><b>""I could make more at Starbucks.""</b><br />To you, an empty class means you can sweep your arms up without whacking your neighbor's head. To your teacher, it's a crappy payday-even if she's way too enlightened to think of it that way. Studios often pay instructors a flat fee, say, $25, plus $5 or so per head. Gyms may pay them a larger fee and nothing extra per student.</p><p><b>""The show-off in the front row is annoying me too.""</b><br />""If I notice anyone trying to stand out, I remind them that it's not a competition-they're not there for me,"" says Nancy Nielsen, an instructor at Zenergy Yoga and Pilates Studio in Greenwood Village, Colorado. ""They need to come back into their breath and their own practice.""</p><p><b>""I didn't feel like coming to class today, either.""</b> <br />""Yoga teachers are not gods,"" Nielsen says. Like you, sometimes it's hard for them to motivate for class. So if you're on the fence, do what they do: Remind yourself that once you get to class and get started, you'll be glad you did. ""It's not always easy to do it, but those are the breaking points that are really important,"" Nielsen says.</p><p><b>""Be your own teacher...""</b><br />""Teachers often have limited viewpoints because they get so wrapped up in the particular school or style they choose,"" says Keith Cini, former owner of Heaven and Earth Yoga in New York City. ""So you need to educate yourself by trying different yoga studios and styles."" Sample a few instructors too. Different teachers have different strengths-alignment, sequencing, philosophy-and you should capitalize on all the wisdom available to you.</p><p><b>""...but not in my class.""</b><br />Deciding you really want to work on <a target=""_self"" href=""/yoga/triangle-pose""><b>triangle pose (trikonasana)</b></a> when the teacher is leading <a target=""_self"" href=""/yoga/warrior-2-pose""><b>warrior II (virabhadrasana II)</b></a> is distracting and disrespectful. Goofing around isn't cool either. ""I kicked a woman out of class once,"" says the New York teacher. ""The theme for the day was 'being present,' and she was chewing gum and slouching and distracting the whole class. You don't have to be perfect but you have to try to be present.""</p><p><b>""There's more to yoga than that.""</b><br />The ancients practiced yoga solely to prepare the body for meditation, Cini says, and that's easy to forget. ""I would love it if students had a clue that yoga's not just a way to stretch your hamstrings,"" says Robin Rothenberg, owner of The Yoga Barn in Issaquah, Washington. ""Yoga has so much potential for developing the mind.""</p><p><b>""I can smell what you had for dinner last night."" </b><br />Put a dozen bodies in a hot, crowded room and there will be noises and odors that aren't always pretty. ""It's cool to be all free and earthy and natural,"" says one teacher, ""but coming to class with B.O. is human cruelty. I won't adjust people who smell bad."" And a minimal dress code should be observed, says another: ""Plumber's bum and excessive cleavage should be as illegal as cell phones in a yoga class.""</p>","Basics,Fix It"

In fact, the pain must rank somewhere between the sting of getting a tattoo on the forehead and genital piercing-three experiences we'd like to skip, thank you very much. However, a 2008 study found that, actually, people overestimate how devastating a split with their loved one will be. Northwestern University researchers followed 69 couples over nearly a year and asked them to report how in love they were and how crushed they would be if they broke up. They found that even those couples who reported being most deeply in love in the beginning of the study and broke up over the course of it weren't as distressed as they'd originally imagined they'd be. In other words, you're more resilient than you realize. </p><p>That's not to say that breaking up doesn't, to be frank, suck. But just as small tears make a muscle grow stronger, emotional bruises can lead to substantial resilience gains. What's more, your new solo status affords you a rare opportunity to revitalize and reconnect with yourself. What better way to do that than throughyoga, whose very meaning is ""union""? Whether you've never stepped onto a mat or are a seasoned practitioner, yoga can be an integral part of <a href=""/yoga/yoga-to-heal-a-broken-heart"">relationship recovery</a>. ""Breakups often stir up emotions that can throw us off-center, leaving us vulnerable, insecure, doubting, scared, and even angry,"" says Los Angeles yoga instructor Rainbeau Mars (check out her Revenge-Body sequence below). ""There is nothing more important than staying grounded, and finding a sense of safety and security despite the emotional rollercoaster.""</p><p></p><p>That's why we called on our yoga experts to create three distinct <a href=""/fitness/workouts"">fitness workouts</a>.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/guide-to-your-digestive-system,Health,22,26,22,6,3,13,0,0,,Your Digestive System,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0611-gut-check-1230.jpg,"No matter how good you look in a belly shirt, your innards are hardly a pretty sight. Your <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/decode-your-stomach-symptoms-3"">gastrointestinal (GI) tract </a>deals with the dirty work of your body: digesting food for nutrients and sending out the trash. This noisy, smelly, squishy system includes the esophagus, a 10 inch-long tube; the stomach, a fist-size bag of muscle; 20 feet of small intestine; and 6 feet of large intestine (aka the colon). With no Google map, we're often left wondering what the holdup (or the rush) is in there and why normally dependable routes suddenly cause trouble. But because of the unappealing issues that arise, talking about your own highway problems isn't as easy as discussing rush-hour traffic. ""There's definitely embarrassment, and women tend to suffer in silence,"" says Jacqueline Wolf, M.D., a women's GI disease specialist at Harvard Medical School. Still, considering that <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/cures-for-common-stomach-pains"">digestive problems</a> - from constipation to <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/decode-your-stomach-symptoms"">acid reflux</a> - affect up to 70 million people, we should muster the guts to find out what's going on beneath our navels.<br /><br /><b>How long does it take for food to travel through my system?</b><br />The majority of the trip averages 24 hours, says Patricia Raymond, M.D., a gastroenterologist in Chesapeake, Virginia. Once a steak hits <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/flatten-your-belly"">your stomach</a>, roughly 3 liters of hydrochloric acid begin to turn it into paste. About 30 minutes later, the food sludge travels to the small intestine, which immediately absorbs the nutrients and sends them to your bloodstream. The leftovers move into the colon, where any remaining liquid is sucked out, and they solidify into feces. This detritus takes from 1 to 4 days to snake its way through your colon and into your sewer system, depending on how much fiber your waste contains, says Michael Levitt, M.D., director of research at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center.<br /><br /><b>Is eating lots of fiber really that important?</b><br />Uh, yeah. Fiber is a component of all plant-based foods, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. You don't <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-tips-2"">digest</a> fiber, so it acts like a Brillo pad for the intestines, scrubbing out bad cholesterol and soaking up water so that waste can glide through. Chances are you're not eating enough (the average person ingests only 7 grams daily, though the RDA is 25 - about six servings of fruit or vegetables and two slices of whole-grain bread). To stay regular, beef up your produce intake. Or take a daily 1,500-milligram fiber supplement of psyllium husks, suggests Mehmet Oz, M.D., professor of surgery at Columbia University and coauthor of <i>You: On a Diet</i>. But if you need immediate action, try a laxative with sennosides, stool-softening agents that help liquids mix with the cement in your pipes. <br /><br /><b>Why does <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/stomach-quiz"">my stomach</a> gurgle when I'm hungry?</b><br />""It's very much like the Pavlov's dog effect,"" Dr. Raymond says. ""You see the food, you smell the food, your saliva glands start to go, and your stomach starts to go."" That sets off a chain reaction of churning, grinding, and spasms in the intestines meant to help food move through the system. If there's not much in there to move, there's nothing to muffle the noise, so the gurgling is louder. Dr. Raymond compares the effect to the way a partially filled water balloon makes more sound than a full one. But bellies rumble even after you've gorged. Called borborygmi, these are simply the sounds of digestive enzymes and gas moving through the intestines.<br /><br /><b>Is there any way to avoid farting?</b><br />Don't go to Jim Carrey movies.<br /><br /><b>Seriously, why do I fart? And can I prevent it?</b><br />We all expel up to 2 liters of gas a day. This gas comes from two sources: ""You either swallow air or you make it from various foods,"" Dr. Levitt says. When you take in air from carbonated drinks and chewing gum, it doesn't smell when it comes out the other end. Noxious emissions happen anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours after you eat, when bacteria that live in your colon dine on leftovers your small intestine can't digest, creating smelly gas as a by-product. <br /><br />Since everything we eat leaves a meal for bacteria, you really can't stop natural gas production. A liquid diet would eliminate most of the fumes because fluids usually leave too little residue for bacteria to get a hold of. A more reasonable solution is to avoid foods on date night that create especially pungent odors. Sulfur-rich items like eggs, broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage produce hydrogen sulfide, which smells like rotten eggs. Beans also create a mighty stink because we lack the enzymes to fully digest the complex sugars they contain (Beano, a natural supplement you take with food, provides the missing enzymes). The sound, however, is all you. A fart becomes audible when you tighten up, Dr. Raymond says. ""If you just relax and let the gas come out, you may have smell, but you won't have that noise."" <br /><br /><b>How often should I be making a deposit?</b> <br />Think quality, not quantity. At any given time, you're lugging around 5 to 7 pounds of waste, and you won't always need to discard the same amount. ""People fixate on their poop frequency,"" Dr. Oz says, ""but what they should look at is a range that is acceptable."" In general, you should be going at least once every 6 to 48 hours. ""It's when you're not comfortable that we worry,"" Dr. Raymond says. Straining to get anything out or to hold anything in could indicate problems, from lactose intolerance to irritable bowel syndrome, requiring medication. <br /><br /><b>What's a healthy bowel <br />movement supposed to look like?</b><br />C'mon, plenty of us watch <i>Extreme Makeover</i>, so we can bear taking a peek at what we leave in the toilet. A bowel movement should be shaped like an ""S"" or a banana because ""that's the shape of your rectum,"" Dr. Oz says. And, like a banana, it should be about 11/2 inches in diameter. Any wider and you're at risk for tiny cuts around the anus. Your stool should also be fairly full and soft, but not so light that it floats like a noodle?a sign you're not digesting fats properly. Under normal circumstances, bile dyes waste a range of brown, green, and yellow hues. But dark red or black stool could be caused by bleeding (a sign of a stomach ulcer), and white or very pale movements mean your gall bladder could be blocked - both cause to see a doctor.<br /><br /><b>Why does coffee open the gates?</b><br />Caffeine awakens nerve fibers in the colon, causing it to contract and move its contents south. (Incidentally, doctors speculate that nicotine also rouses the intestines.) But when you drink your espresso may be more the issue than what's in your cup. When your stomach senses the first food or drink of the day, be it coffee, oatmeal, or an Egg McMuffin, it sends a hormonal message to the colon to contract. This phenomenon, called gastrocolic reflex, gives whatever's sitting around a friendly nudge to make sure your previous meals don't stick with you for too long.<br /><br /><b>I hear that bacteria in yogurt are good for my stomach. Why?</b><br />Despite all the Purell and Lysol on store shelves, we actually need some bacteria. About 400 species of microbes reside in the large intestine. These one-celled creatures are essential for GI functioning: They help digest your food, strengthen your immune system, and manufacture some essential vitamins. Problems arise when antibiotics meant for germs wipe out the good guys as well. Killing good bacteria allows undesirable organisms to start growing, says Cynthia Robertson, M.D., integrative medicine specialist and gastroenterologist in San Diego. That's why so many of us get that lovely one-two punch of a yeast infection right after treating a bladder infection. Eating yogurt with acidophilus or taking probiotic supplements restores good bacteria.<br /><br /><b>Why do I get diarrhea right before my period?</b><br />Hormones. Estrogen, specifically, speeds up the intestines, so stool is looser and moves faster.<br /><br /><b>What causes Montezuma's revenge?</b><br />Diarrhea happens when stool moves so quickly through the intestines that the bowels don't have time to reabsorb water. Bacteria, viruses, and parasites are the main culprits. When you travel, foreign microorganisms in food and water can send you to the ba?o because we don't have tolerance to the bugs like the locals do. ""[Often] the reason you have diarrhea is your body is trying to get rid of that toxin you ingested,"" says Robynne Chutkan, M.D., founder and medical director of the Digestive Center for Women in Washington, D.C. If the runs come with a high fever, severe cramping, or blood, you likely have an infection - and you should not take medications like loperamide (Imodium) that slow the gut. Instead, pick Pepto: It contains bismuth, which absorbs the toxin, says Lucinda A. Harris, M.D., senior associate consultant at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona. If your symptoms are less severe, loperamide will safely dam the river, Dr. Chutkan says. Other instigators could include lactose, gluten, or fructose intolerance; fatty meals and alcohol; or stress, which causes the intestines to speed up and the colon to contract. See a doctor if diarrhea occurs for more than 3 days. <br /><br />You can also calm diarrhea or nausea by giving your upset stomach something to digest. Eating small portions of food helps combat the erratic convulsions associated with queasiness, Dr. Robertson says. You should drink clear liquids and eat bland foods like rice and toast. <br /><br /><b>What sorts of gut pains are signs of a problem?</b><br />The difficulty with diagnosing GI illnesses is that the nerves in the digestive system don't always flare up at the problem's source, so it's hard to pinpoint the cause of pain, explains G. Richard Locke, M.D., a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Most abdominal pangs are more annoying than alarming. ""A single episode that lasts only a few minutes, unless it's severe and doubles you over, isn't something that you should worry about,"" Dr. Wolf says. When should you worry? If pain persists or is accompanied by loose or bloody stool or weight loss, see a doctor - you could have gallstones or even heart problems. But a digestive disorder like lactose or gluten intolerance is most often the root of GI grief. (See ""<a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/article/0,,s1-3-70-1231-1,00.html"">Middle Management</a>,"" for more on GI symptoms.)<br /><br /><b>Do I need a colonic?</b> <br />Sticking a water hose up the dark side of your moon isn't something gastroenterologists endorse. ""It's basically useless and potentially dangerous,"" says Carol E. Semrad, M.D., an associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago. There's a risk of infection from improperly cleaned equipment, and a technician could puncture your colon with the nozzle. Besides, there's nothing hanging around your innards from the original Bush administration. And what's the point of polishing them up when your body will start building up waste all over again as soon as you pull the hose out? Cleansing is warranted only for severe constipation requiring hospitalization. ""That's not something to go to a spa for,"" Dr. Semrad says. <br /><br /><b>Why do some people get heartburn and others have cast-iron stomachs?</b><br />If your stomach is as temperamental as a PMS'ing Naomi Campbell, it's likely because certain foods are relaxing the muscle at the bottom of your esophagus. Called the esophageal sphincter, this muscle bars stomach contents from flowing up. With the seal open, acid reflux may occur: Digestive juices splash into the esophagus, causing burning sensations. Drinking alcohol or caffeine; eating fatty, spicy, or acidic foods; and eating before bed can relax the sphincter if you're sensitive to these irritants - doctors don't know why hot wings haunt some people and not others. And rising progesterone levels during pregnancy or the 2 weeks after ovulation cause heartburn because the hormone loosens not only uterine muscles but also the muscle around the esophagus. <br /><br />The ouch factor is significant. ""The esophagus is a very thin-walled structure,"" Dr. Oz says. ""It doesn't have specialized cells to protect it against acid like the stomach."" Like skin, a burned esophagus takes a couple of days to heal. And just as sunburns can progress to cancer, if your esophagus is singed too often, it can eventually develop cancer. If you have heartburn for more than 3 months (even just off and on), see a doctor before your esophagus is permanently fried. In the meantime, because acid can trickle down while you're sleeping, place a couple of James Frey books under your headboard to keep your noggin slightly elevated. <br /><br /><b>Can I get my stomach to?shrink without surgery?</b><br />No, Star, you can't. The stomach holds about 50 milliliters (3 1/2 tablespoons) when empty, but its lining has deep folds that expand once you chow down and can accommodate 4 cups of food. The good news is that you can feel like your stomach has shrunk. Think of the stomach as you would any other muscle: If you're not used to touching your toes, you can reach only to a certain point before discomfort sets in. If you reach a little farther (or add another scoop of Häagen-Dazs) every day, your threshold gradually rises. The opposite is true as well. ""The stomach essentially stays the same size, but the point at which you sense fullness can change depending on how much you eat,"" Dr. Chutkan says. Eat less and you'll feel full more quickly.  <br />","You and Improved,Be In The Know"

Female participation grew 20 percent between 2003 and 2012, while men's numbers have remained relatively flat, and a whopping 60 percent of bike owners today are women ages 17 to 28. Even the most famous bike race, the male-only Tour de France, is catching on: For the first time, it will offer a one-day women's race.</p><p>""I predict that cycling will continue to become more mainstream for women, much like running and yoga,"" says Elysa Walk, general manager of Giant Bicycle, parent company of Liv, the only full-line female-focused cycling brand. ""There's so much infrastructure coming in-like education and coaching-and brands are inviting women into this sport in a way that we never have before.""</p><p>In case you haven't noticed, women aren't just rolling around on cute cruisers. They're commuting to work, tackling trails, and training for century rides and triathlons. Get in on the fun with our female-centric cycling guide.</p><p><strong>ROAD CYCLING</strong><br />Whether you're commuting, running errands, or working out, going for a spin in your 'hood has never been easier, thanks to the nationwide expansion of bike lanes (find them on <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://mapmyride.com"">mapmyride.com</a>).</p><p><strong>KNOW BEFORE YOU GO</strong><br /><strong>Eyes ahead.</strong> Your bike will follow your gaze, especially when flying downhill. ""Look where you want to go, or about 20 feet ahead,"" says Evie Stevens, 2012 Olympian and Team Specialized-Lululemon pro rider. ""Then just stay focused and trust your bike.""<br /><strong>Go the distance.</strong> Riding about 80 to 100 revolutions per minute can help your muscles and legs last longer, says Stevens. To calculate your rpm, count how often your right knee rises in 15 seconds, then multiply it by four (20 to 25 equals a cadence between 80 and 100). On climbs, shift to an easier gear (90 to 95 rpms); your muscles should tire out more quickly if you push a slow cadence of 65 to 70.<br /><strong>Save your seat.</strong> Wearing bike shorts with underwear is a classic newbie mistake, says Kelli Emmet, a Liv/giant ambassador. The seams can rub your skin raw. ""Plus, we can all see your panty line under the Lycra!"" she laughs. Another no-no: Don't hang out in your shorts for too long after your ride. ""Take 'em off as soon as you're done to help prevent more chafing and moisture buildup,"" she says.</p><p><strong>YOUR BEST BIKES</strong><br /><strong>1.

Stand up on the pedals, elbows bent about 45 degrees, and think about separating your bike from your body, says Emmet. ""Let the bike move beneath you while keeping your weight centered, your arms relaxed, and your shoulders pointed in the direction you're headed.""<br /><strong>Save your tires.</strong> Proper tire pressure can help fend off flats. ""Fat tires"" (on mountain bikes) can take a max of about 50 psi, but that doesn't mean you want to fill 'em up all the way. ""Riding at a lower pressure helps with traction, cornering, and comfort while riding,"" says Georgia Gould, Olympic mountain bike bronze medalist and Luna Pro Team member. ""Start at around 25 to 27 psi [or 110 psi for road bikes], and work from there,"" she says.<br /><strong>Stay positive when you pedal.</strong> Off-roading can feel intimidating to newbies, but your mindset can have a big impact on your ride performance. When you ride with self-doubt, you may tense up, which can lead to mistakes, says Teal Stetson-Lee, a mountain biker on Luna Pro Team. ""It can become a vicious cycle,"" she adds.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/christina-applegate-interview,Health,104,25,3,9,0,9,1,0,,Christina Applegate's Life After Breast Cancer,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0910-applegate-interview-art.jpg,"Photograph By <p>You could say that Christina Applegate knows how to work a room-even a hospital room. When the actress was in the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles recovering from breast cancer surgery last year, her wicked sense of humor never failed her. ""I laughed more in the hospital than I ever have in my life, making fun of all the weird things that were happening to me,"" she remembers. ""My friends would walk in with this sad look, and I would throw something at them and say, 'Come on! This isn't the end of the world!'""</p><p>That's for sure. Today Applegate is the picture of health and radiance. Barefoot and dressed in a cotton tank and ankle-­grazing skirt, her buttery blond hair swept into two thick braids, she looks serene perched on a white sofa in her L.A. home for our interview. Her live-in boyfriend, musician Martyn Lenoble, 40, putters in the kitchen, and Tallulah, her dachshund-mini Doberman mix, naps on her lap.</p><p>Christina was sitting in this very spot when she learned she had cancer. An MRI had revealed something ""funky"" in her left breast, and a biopsy confirmed that the mass was malignant. Her oncologist had not intended to deliver the news over the phone, but when she called and asked her to come in to ""talk,"" Christina demanded to know the results then and there, because at home ""you can fall on the floor and cry,"" she says. Christina did just that until her mother, Nancy Priddy, arrived. ""I lay in her lap and just screamed and screamed,"" she says. (Nancy had been diagnosed with breast cancer at 38, when Christina was just 7 years old.) ""Even though it ran in my family, I never in a million years thought it would happen to me. I was scared shitless.""</p><p><strong>Facing the news-and the public</strong><br />The call set in motion a terrifying and life-changing chain of events. Because she had a family history of breast cancer, Christina then decided to be tested for a BRCA mutation. (Women with a mutation of these genes have a 40 to 85 percent risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer; it also increases the odds that the cancer will reappear if you do get it.) After the test came back positive, Christina elected to have a double mastectomy; reconstructive surgery followed in November-just four days before her 37th birthday. ""I've never had a year where I got hit hard that much,"" she confesses. ""The amount of things that happened in a really short period of time-devastating.""</p><p>In August 2008, less than a month after the double mastectomy, rumors about her diagnosis were leaked to the press, forcing her to go public with her experience before she felt strong enough to talk about it. The following month, she attended the Emmy Awards, as a best actress in a comedy series nominee for her role as a sassy amnesiac on the since-cancelled sitcom Samantha Who?, in a diaphanous blue Reem Acra gown that had been reconstructed at the bodice to conceal her missing breasts. (She received a second Emmy nod for her show this year.) ""It was my coming out, I guess,"" she says. ""I knew everyone would be looking. I just thought, 'Please don't cry, please don't cry, please don't cry.'""</p><p>She kept it together, and once she did start sharing, she found that words began to come more easily. ""Now I can talk about the ugly parts of it without losing it,"" says Christina, who has launched a foundation, Right Action for Women, to fund MRIs for high-risk young women who are uninsured or can't get their insurance companies to cover the expensive testing. ""I found out that there was something wrong after my MRI,"" she says. ""Had it not been for [the test], I don't know what would've happened."" The organization has also given her a chance to connect with other survivors. Says Christina: ""There's a real kinship when we meet. We hold each other tight because we know where the other has been: to hell and back.""</p><p>Christina has also found other ways to spread the word. Last year she joined breast cancer survivors Sheryl Crow and Melissa Etheridge onstage at a ""Stand Up to Cancer"" benefit in L.A. ""Backstage, Jennifer Aniston said something like, 'I don't like having to see my three girlfriends up there, but I am so proud of you.' That was nice,"" she says.</p><p>She's also the ambassador for Lee National Denim Day, a fundraiser for breast cancer research held every October (she's also wearing a pair of Lee's on this very cover). ""It's good to encourage others, but if you don't feel sorry for yourself once in a while, you're just not normal,"" Christina says. ""I'm grateful that I caught it before I needed chemo, but the whole experience really sucked.""</p><p>Her candor extends to her take on the new breasts too. ""It's really hard, because they just aren't the same-and I had really good ones,"" she says with a laugh. ""If you have boobs you don't like, you can go and choose the size you want, and then get a brand-new present. But it's different [when it's not your choice]. And they feel really weird. There's a numbness--my back is still numb. Even exercising feels strange. It'll take two years [for the sensation] to come back. But I hold on to the fact that I don't have to wear a bra, which is great!""</p><p>Post-recovery, she's focused on restoring balance and banishing all stress from her life. ""I gained 10 pounds [after] the surgery, so I'm trying to get back in shape,"" Christina says. Her plan includes high-octane boot-camp fitness classes and a macrobiotic diet of mainly kale, rice, beans, and tofu. ""I allow myself a piece of pizza every once in a while, and I'm not filled with shame when I do,"" she says. Nor did she feel any remorse after eating untold plates of fresh mozzarella and tomato on a recent jaunt to Italy with Martyn. ""If I see another Caprese salad, I'm going to lose it! We kind of went balls out.""</p><p>Other temptations, though, have triggered a much more serious backlash. Last April, a photograph of Christina smoking a cigarette appeared on the web-a hypocritical move for a cancer survivor and advocate. The incident still makes her cringe. ""I'm a human being, and I make mistakes. I fall back on things,"" she says of the habit. ""[Not smoking] is always a struggle.""</p><p><strong>Living in the moment</strong><br />Though Christina Applegate literally grew up on TV-she was 3 months old for her first role on Days of Our Lives, alongside her actress mom-there's still a part of her that's squeamish about being in the spotlight. ""I'm shy and don't like all eyes on me,"" says the actress, whose mother and record-producer father divorced soon after she was born. ""If I go to a party, I'm uncomfortable. I'd rather just stay home, watch an old Katharine Hepburn movie, put a fire in the fireplace, and hang out with Martyn.""</p><p>Martyn, as Christina is quick to point out, has been her rock throughout the ordeal. ""I don't think I would have been able to get through any of it without him,"" she says of the Dutch-born bass player, whom she first met at an L.A. music club over 10 years ago. The couple reconnected last year after running into each other at a local children's hospital where both happened to be volunteering. ""He's just a well-adjusted, happy person. All the love and calm he adds to my life is really valuable,"" she says, beaming.</p><p>Talk of recent proposal rumors makes her shake her head and sigh-though she admits that she would like to have a family one day. ""Can a girl please wear a ring on her left hand and not have it be all, 'Is she engaged?'"" asks Christina, whose four-year marriage to actor Johnathon Schaech ended in 2005.</p><p>Right now, Applegate would rather focus on the day-to-day than look far into the future. ""I've never been one to pull the covers over my head. I have to push through things,"" she says. To help her cope, she has adopted a set of life rules, some serious (""If you get too caught up in the outer, you forget about the inner"") and others kind of silly (""If you know you can't fit into those jeans, then don't even try to put them on"")</p><p>And then there are those messages she sends to herself. On her bathroom mirror she has written empowering mantras in siren-red lipstick. I am a miracle of health, reads one; I am joy, proclaims another. If there's anything left in that little tube of red, she might consider adding one more message: I am an inspiration.</p>","breast cancer,breast cancer survivor stories"
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/de-stress-for-better-sleep,Health,4,25,13,5,0,1,0,0,,Sleeplessness and Stress,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/images/sleep-center/sleep-back-button.gif,"<p>Finding yourself wide awake after a few hours of <a target=""_blank"" href=""/health/sleep-better-0"">sleep</a>, or waking often during the night is called ""parasomnia"" or ""sleep maintenance <a target=""_blank"" href=""/health/battle-insomnia"">insomnia</a>,"" and it's much more common than people think. A 2005 National Sleep Foundation poll found that 75 percent of adults frequently have <a target=""_blank"" href=""/health/sleep-encyclopedia"">symptoms of sleep dysfunction</a>, including waking during the night. </p><p>Just as the victims in slasher flicks make fatal errors (why are you running up the stairs?), we are often our own worst enemies when it comes to a solid <a target=""_blank"" href=""/health/sleep-aids"">night of sleep</a>. ""People think that because they're able to fall asleep they'll stay asleep, even if they've had too much caffeine,"" says Rubin Naiman, Ph.D., a sleep and dream specialist at Andrew Weil's Program in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona. </p><p>But for most of us, trouble sleeping isn't usually caused by that espresso at 5 p.m. ""The root of most sleep problems is <a target=""_blank"" href=""/nutrition/stress-busting-foods"">stress</a>,"" says Jeffrey Thompson, director of the Center for Neuroacoustic Research and creator of an audio sleeping aid called the Delta Sleep System. </p><p>We're overloaded, over-stimulated, and overwhelming our bodies' ability to relax. ""Our nervous system is built for a sprint, but we're living in a stress marathon,"" he says. ""If you go to bed worried you're probably going to wake up in the middle of the night,"" Dr. Naiman adds. And when sleeplessness happens, as you probably know, the next day is pretty much shot. </p><p>A new generation of sleep scientists are overturning the conventional wisdom about parasomnia. (Counting sheep? Out.) The <a target=""_blank"" href=""/health/the-top-doctors-in-america"">doctors</a> say: You can do it. With a few simple changes in your routine, a little visualization, a couple of surprisingly counter-intuitive moves and perhaps an attitude adjustment, a peaceful night of slumber can be yours. Here's their best advice: </p><p><b>Throw out your definition of a good night's sleep </b><br />Just as <a target=""_blank"" href=""/nutrition/healthy-eating"">three meals a day</a> has given way to all-day grazing and smaller portions, ""what's good for you"" has changed here, too. </p><p>""Thinking it's necessary to stay asleep for 8 hours straight may be unrealistic,"" says David Neubauer, M.D., associate director of the Johns Hopkins Sleep Disorders Center and author of <i>Understanding Sleeplessness: Perspectives on Insomnia.</i> ""Just as we experience a dip in alertness mid-afternoon, the inverse is a dip in sleepiness in the middle of the night. There's strong evidence that there's a kind of awakening that's totally normal."" History supports this take, Dr. Naiman says. ""Before the industrial revolution, people had their first sleep for 3 to 4 hours, awoke for an hour or two, then slept for another 3 or 4 hours."" </p><p>Even waking every 60 to 90 minutes can be part of a healthy sleep pattern. The deeper stages of sleep, or REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, occur about every 90 minutes and get longer as the night goes on, so your brain might become more alert between those cycles. </p><p>Since we're conditioned to think that waking during the night is a problem, when it happens, we <a target=""_blank"" href=""/health/how-to-handle-panic-attacks"">panic</a>. That reaction causes our brains to awaken even further, Dr. Neubauer explains. </p><p>If you find yourself awake in pre-dawn hours, Dr. Naiman advises first assessing your physical state. Do you have an ache, a cramp, or need to go to the bathroom? If so, take care of it. </p><p>If you don't have a physical complaint, then chances are you are experiencing a normal stage of the sleep cycle. Knowing this ""helps replace worries that you'll be useless without 8 solid hours of sleep with more neutral thoughts,"" suggests Sat Bir Khalsa, Ph.D., instructor in medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital at Harvard Medical School. ""The useful thought is: 'I can handle the disruption and still feel rested.'"" </p><p><b>Get bed-ready </b><br />After an action-packed day (or one equally packed with worry), our brains need some time to catch up, to make order of things, and to slow their frenetic firing before we're ready to sleep. Pure bodily exhaustion can probably get you at least that first hour of dozing, but then worries will rise to the surface and cause you to stir. How can you get your mind to chill? </p><p>""We need to learn to apply the brakes before the car is in the garage,"" Dr. Naiman says. ""Clearing your head is key to a good night of sleep."" Simply taking 15 minutes to sit quietly, meditate, pray, or do rhythmic breathing can allow your mind to slow down enough to sleep through the night. </p><p>Establishing any ritual that you do before bed-anything but checking your e-mail!-will do more than relax you right then and there. The repetition also conditions your brain and body for sleep, Thompson explains. </p><p>While you're transitioning to Z-mode the same way night after night, you're also creating a Pavlovian response to your ritual. So simply sitting in the spot where you do your breathing or turning on the shower water signals your mind that it will be sleeping soon, Thompson says. </p><p>Another way to condition yourself sleepward is by playing off the body's internal clock. Dr. Naiman suggests simulating dusk about an hour before you plan to go to bed and dimming the lights significantly. This triggers natural circadian rhythms that help us prepare for sleep. </p><p><b>Make the breath-brain connection </b><br />Dr. Khalsa recently supervised a small Harvard study using specific breathing techniques to treat insomnia, and all subjects reported an improvement in the quality and quantity of sleep. ""There is evidence that long, slow abdominal breathing will reduce anxiety and arousal,"" Dr. Khalsa explains. Dr. Naiman recommends one breathing exercise (similar to those Dr. Khalsa used) called the 4-7-8 breath exercise. With your tongue resting on the roof of your mouth, just behind your upper teeth, exhale completely. Close your mouth and inhale through your nose for four counts. Hold your breath for seven counts. Then, exhale while mentally counting to eight. Repeat the cycle three more times. Both are important for restful sleep. </p><p><b>Take a pose to the doze </b><br />""There's a feedback loop between the muscles and the brain,"" Dr. Naiman explains. ""When you stretch and release tension, the brain relaxes too."" The deepest meditative state is known as ""sleepless sleep."" </p><p>To get to a sleepful state, Dr. Khalsa finds the <a target=""_blank"" href=""/fitness/bedtime-yoga"">yoga</a> Bridge pose especially useful. Lie on your back with knees bent at a 90-degree angle and your heels parallel, close to your butt. Lift your hips and arch up onto your shoulders. Lace your palms together underneath your body and press your arms into the floor or mat. Hold the posture while taking 10 to 15 long, slow breaths. </p><p><b>When you wake up anyway </b><br />Despite all your best efforts, here you are, awake at an hour even a fisherman would call ungodly. What do you do now? First, here's a big don't: ""If you open your eyes and see the clock, that's it for many stressed people,"" Dr. Walsleben says. ""Seeing the time can trigger them to become fully awake."" Keep your eyes closed, roll over, or move the clock so the display isn't visible. </p><p>If you're still far from dreamland try a mantra. Silently repeat any word that's soothing or pleasant to you, or simply think ""inhale"" as you inhale ""exhale"" as you release your breath. Thinking the words over and over focuses and relaxes you, but requires less energy and attention than counting sheep, which can actually be too engaging to work the way it's supposed to. </p><p><b>""Get out, get out!"" </b><br />After 15 minutes of lying awake in bed, you need a change of venue. ""When someone can't sleep, the bedroom can become a torture chamber,"" Dr. Khalsa says. ""Staying there is counter-productive."" And you risk associating the bed with your trouble sleeping, which will exacerbate the problem in nights to come. </p><p>Go to go to another room. You don't want to become too alert, so make sure you have a nightlight in your hallway and won't need to turn on brighter lights. Occupy yourself with something calming like knitting, listening to chill music on your iPod, or even performing your pre-sleep ritual again. Only when you feel drowsy, Dr. Khalsa says, should you go back to bed. In a very short while, you should be the picture of blissful sleep. </p><p><b>Getting your nap on </b><br />It's not just for toddlers. Napping makes great sense for adults, whether or not it puts you in touch with your inner child. When adults napped between 2 and 4 p.m., one recent study showed, they performed better on tests and had no problems falling asleep at night. </p><p>NASA found that military pilots and astronauts who took a 40-minute nap improved alertness by 100 percent and performance by 34 percent, and recent Harvard University research also revealed that college students who napped between tasks performed better than those who stayed awake. </p><p>How does napping work its brain magic? ""It may protect brain circuits from overuse until those neurons can consolidate what's been learned about a procedure,"" says Robert Stickgold, Ph.D., coauthor of the Harvard study. </p><p>Unless you know the correct way to conduct a daytime doze, however, you could snooze and lose. ""Napping can steal the drive for nighttime sleep, so you need to be cautious,"" says David Neubauer, M.D., associate director of the Johns Hopkins Sleep Disorders Center. ""The key is to nap early and short."" </p><p>By early he means daylight hours, at least five hours before you plan on going to sleep that night (between 2 and 4 p.m. is prime). Any later and your circadian rhythms will kick in, possibly making you feel disoriented upon waking and likely preventing you from conking out come your regular bedtime. As for short, keep your naps to less than an hour; 20 to 30 minutes is enough for most people to get the benefits. </p><p>To help stick to this nap-plan, stay out of the sack-likely not a problem at the office-since you associate your bed with long periods of rest. Find a quiet couch or carpeted floor where you can lie down. Even shutting your eyes in your office chair for 20 minutes will relax and refresh you. (That's if you can stifle your phone; if not, find an unused conference room.) </p><p>Home or work, you'll find that-just like in kindergarten-after a nice restorative nap, you'll play much better with others. </p><p>More from <i>WH</i>:<br /><a href=""/health/sleep-deprivation"">The Cost of Lost Shuteye</a><br /><a href=""/health/sleep-away-from-home"">The Best Hotels for Sleeping </a><br /><a href=""/health/alarm-clocks"">The Best Alarm Clocks</a> </p><p><a href=""/health/sleep-better-0""></a></p><a href=""/health/sleep-better-0""></a><p></p>","You and Improved,Be In The Know"

""People tend to feel more sexual in warm weather because they're visually stimulated by all the flesh on display,"" says Debby Herbenick, Ph.D., author of <em>Because It Feels Good</em>. ""And we're subconsciously reminded of sex because the sun flushes the skin in a very similar way to the glow people have when they are aroused."" So embrace the sultry season, full on.</p><p><strong>1. It's a Great Time to be Spontaneous.</strong><br />After spending nearly two decades in school, we're conditioned to look for play in June. And leaving behind that cooped-up, cabin-fever attitude triggers a carefree, ready-for-anything mind-set that stokes the relationship fires. ""Keeping each other guessing increases the production of dopamine, a hormone associated with excitement and anticipation that makes couples feel more sexually attracted to each other,"" says Scott Haltzman, M.D., author of <em>The Secrets of Happily Married Women</em>.</p><p><strong>2. You Have Hot-Weather Lust</strong><br />. Most of the nation experienced below-normal dips in the mercury this past winter and spring, so we're all pumped for rising temps. ""Exposure to sunlight triggers the body to produce mood-boosting dopamine and serotonin, plus a hormone called MSH-all of which spur your libido,"" says Michael F. Holick, Ph.D., M.D., author of <em>The Vitamin D Solution</em>. Also, since the days are longer, you'll feel the sun's effects even more. Celebrate the Summer Solstice (June 21), when you'll have 15 hours of sunlight at your disposal.</p><p><strong>3. Sex Will Feel More Intense.</strong><br />You were caged in all winter, so now that the sun is beating down, take to the sexy outdoors to experience magnified sensations. ""The beauty of having sex in nature is that it engages all of your senses-the aroma of fresh flowers, the cool breeze on your warm skin, the soft earth under your body,"" says Gilda Carle, Ph.D., author of <em>99 Prescriptions for Fidelity</em>. ""These new stimuli make sex more of a mind-body experience."" There are plenty of outdoor venues available (think private beach, backyard...), so get busy.</p><p><strong>4. Your Nose Can Act As A Sexual Spy.</strong><br />A woman can subconsciously smell whether or not a man is into her just by standing close to him, according to the Journal of Neuroscience. ""A man who's attracted to a woman will secrete chemicals through his sweat glands that her brain instinctively encodes as sexual interest,"" says Helen Fisher, Ph.D., author of <em>Why Him? Why Her?</em> And according to Alan Hirsch, M.D., director of the Smell & Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago, a woman's superior sense of smell is even sharper in the summer, thanks to the added moisture in the air. So right now, you're in prime position to weed out the guys who just want to be pals. ""Pay attention to your gut,"" says Fisher. If you find yourself feeling especially confident and attractive around a guy, it's probably because he digs you.</p><p><strong>5. Your Sex Appeal Is Smokin'.</strong><br />Warm weather means you don't have to try very hard to look hot-you're already baring more of your bod in cutoff shorts and strapless dresses. Just don't go overboard with the flesh flashing. ""Novelty is the driving force behind male attraction, so if you show all of your goods, he may not be motivated to discover any more of you,"" says Bethany Marshall, Ph.D., author of <em>Deal Breakers</em>.</p><p><strong>6. Love Feels Like a Vacation.</strong><br />Even if you can't jet off on a vacay as easily as Jay-Z and Beyonce can, try to make a mini escape with your man. ""Couples tend to have more explosive sex on vacation, because without the stressors of the daily grind-a major libido killer- they can really focus on their relationship,"" says Carle. ""After all that undivided attention, you'll feel closer because you'll remember why you fell in love in the first place.""</p><p><strong>7. You'll Widen Your Dating Pool.</strong><br />Basking in warm, pleasant weather for 30 minutes makes people more open-minded and receptive to new situations, according to research conducted at the University of Michigan. ""Being outside readjusts your outlook,"" says Holick. ""The sun represses melatonin levels, making you feel alert, open to new ideas, and willing to put yourself in unfamiliar territory."" You can also apply that creative streak in the bedroom by spending time in the sun before getting busy, then mixing up your moves. Have sex without kissing, or just ditch foreplay and go straight to intercourse.</p><p><strong>8. You're So Hot, You Turn Yourself On.</strong><br />Steaming bowls of carb-heavy chili and gooey pizza are winter comfort foods, but they're not exactly bikinifriendly. It's lucky, then, that in the summer we naturally crave a different family of foods that boost our mood and appreciation of our body. ""In the summer, when people are more dehydrated from the sun, they're more likely to eat energizing, tummy-flattening, water-based foods such as citrus, spinach, and cold soup,"" says Bonnie Taub-Dix, R.D., author of the upcoming book <em>Read It Before You Eat It</em>. That has a cool payoff: ""When people feel healthier and lighter, they feel more comfortable in their skin. And that newfound confidence creates a sexy frame of mind, prompting you to hit the sheets more often.</p>",

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/stay-motivated,Fitness,15,24,2,5,0,1,3,0,,Keep Dropping Your New Workout? ,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0907-blonde-runner.jpg,"<p>There's a totally legit reason you always seem to fall off the workout wagon: The conventional approach to exercise almost forces you to bail out. So we asked experts who specialize in the science of motivation to explain how to keep your butt in gear. As it happens, just a few simple behavioral tweaks can silence the call of the couch. </p><p><b>Why We Quit (And The One Thing That Can Keep Us Going)</b><br />Research shows that 50 percent of people who start a<a href=""/fitness/workouts""> new workout </a>program drop out within six months. That's because the most common reasons given for exercising-""My boyfriend says I should lose five pounds""; ""My doctor keeps bugging me about it""-have very little to do with you, says Edward Deci, Ph. D., a professor of psychology at the University of Rochester, who has studied motivation for decades. In fact, working out to make others happy is the least successful way to compel you to break a sweat. One study found that people who signed up for exercise classes because they wanted to feel good were more likely to attend than those who did it to look good. </p><p>Curing the motivation problem is at the crux of a theory developed by Deci and his colleagues called Self Determination Theory (SDT ). It boils down to this: The more you do stuff you like to do and not what you think you should do, the more you'll keep doing it. The benefits of this intrinsic motivation have been proven in studies across the board, from education to health care to parenting. In exercise research, intrinsically motivated exercisers were more likely than those who were nagged by friends or family to continue working out for six months or more. </p><p>Experts say these three subtle shifts in your outlook can keep you on track, here are their<a href=""/fitness""> fitness tips</a>: </p><p><b>Step 1: Take charge </b><br />Appoint yourself CEO of your fitness decisions. Don't let well-meaning friends (or mothers or spouses) force you into another gym membership you won't use. Psychologists call this autonomy, and it's one thing you must develop if you want to harness intrinsic motivation. ""People who feel as if they're making their own decisions report feeling higher levels of self-worth,"" says Philip Wilson, Ph. D., an associate professor of psychology at Brock University in Ontario who studies SDT and exercise. ""And that leaves them feeling more motivated."" </p><p>How do you take the wheel? Start by asking yourself why you want to exercise at all. If the answer is that your boyfriend casually dropped the phrase ""muffin top"" when you were jeans shopping, your efforts are probably doomed. But if you decide to get fit because you want to feel stronger or healthier, you're more likely to be successful, because the end result means something to you. </p><p>Next, find a form of exercise you enjoy so much you'd do it even if it weren't good for you. If the mellow vibe of Hatha yoga brings you bliss, light up some incense and roll out a mat. If slamming a tennis ball is more your thing, join a league or sign up for lessons. Perhaps most important: If you truly despise running on the treadmill (or doing crunches or taking spin class), don't! If you're invested in what you're doing, your performance will improve-and that will feed your desire to go back for more. </p><p>If you honestly can't equate exercise with fun, flex your take-charge muscle by setting specific personal goals. Working your way up to three no-cheating-allowed pullups? Finishing your first 5-K? Whatever your goal, it can help you stay motivated for the short term and the long. </p><p>""People thrive on feedback, and having goals provides that,"" says WH contributor Rachel Cosgrove, co-owner of Results Fitness, a Santa Clarita, California-based gym. Eighty percent of the clients there renew their memberships every year- double the industry standard. </p><p>Cosgrove helps clients create meaningful goals by getting them to focus on tangible accomplishments, like completing an hour-long workout twice a week, doing five pullups or 10 pushups. At the same time, she discourages them from stepping on the scale. </p><p>""Goals should be based on feeling good-that's what keeps people coming back to the gym,"" she says. Deci's research supports Cosgrove's approach. Physical accomplishments give you positive feelings about yourself and increase motivation because they're intrinsic; looking for validation via external motivators, like the scale parked in your bathroom, does not. </p><p></p><p><b>Step 2: Give yourself props for progress</b><br />How many times have you said to yourself during a workout, ""I'm getting nowhere""? Nothing evaporates motivation faster than feeling like you're not making any noticeable improvement. </p><p>The problem: When it comes to working out, women are notorious for seeking a comfort zone. Once we master a new skill (like holding plank position for 60 seconds or running at a 10-minute mile pace), we stick with it because, hey, we know we can do it. But it also impedes progress and breeds big-time boredom. </p><p>""The less interesting something is, the less motivated we are,"" Wilson says. Some of his earliest SDT studies showed that humans have a basic need to feel engaged-take away the novelty, and motivation vanishes. And Groundhog Day-style monotony isn't just bad for your head; eventually your muscles stop responding and you really hit a wall. </p><p>The solutions: Mixing things up and pushing yourself. ""Changing the intensity and type of exercise trains the muscles differently, and you'll start to see improvements more quickly,"" Wilson says. For example, increase the weight you're lifting and the number of reps and sets by 10 percent every week. The same goes for your cardio-increase the amount in 10 percent increments each week. Do this for three weeks, and then drop back down to where you started on week four to let your body rest, Cosgrove says. </p><p>Next, write everything down. A workout log functions not only as an exercise checklist but as a concrete record of how far you've come-a way to motivate yourself if you become frustrated. In researcher-speak, this is called establishing competence, and it's at the core of the second step in fueling motivation that lasts. To make it work, keep the focus on what you can do, rather than what you can't, Wilson says. And don't compare yourself to anyone else. Once you start focusing on you, your confidence will grow and ignite a cycle of positive reinforcement that will keep you hooked. </p><p><b>Step 3: Make it social</b><br />Besides the dirty martinis, there's a reason you go to happy hour every week. You get to socialize, laugh, and hang with friends. It makes you feel connected. According to the principles of SDT, making your workouts more like happy hour will put you well on your way to stoking your inner motivator. </p><p>Start by finding like-minded workout buddies. A study by Canadian researchers found that a congenial atmosphere, rather than a competitive one, helps people stay motivated by providing a source of encouragement. In Cosgrove's gym, clients work out in small groups of three to five people with similar fitness goals. ""The group provides built-in support, and it's way more fun than working out alone,"" Cosgrove says. Members push each other to reach goals and cheer each other on. And when someone has a bad day, the group is there to lift spirits and sympathize. </p><p>If you go to a gym, get to know a few trainers-even if your relationship is limited to their giving you pointers on form. If you don't love gyms, Wilson recommends hooking up with a friend with a similar fitness level or searching the message boards of local leagues or clubs to find people who share your definition of fun. If you're a lone ranger at heart, don't sweat it. Just focus more on taking charge of your fitness and feeling good about your progress, Wilson says. </p><p>The ability to stick to a workout-and get the body that makes you happy-isn't the sole domain of professional athletes and Type A exercisers. You already have what you need within you: It's just a matter of tweaking your perspective so you can tap into what really gets you going.<br /></p>",Better Sex

So she designs what she calls ""integrated programs"" -- a fancy way of saying that each move works as much of the body as possible. Two areas that get top priority: glutes and hamstrings. Because women's hips are wider (the better to pop out babies with), our knees tend to collapse inward, which can cause muscle strains and tears. Working your bum and the backs of your legs will help keep the knees stable.<br /><br /><b>Steal This: Double-Arm Airplane Row</b><br />""This all-in-one move stretches and strengthens nearly every muscle in the body. It also builds muscles while they're elongated, which is when they're weakest,"" McMillan says. This means more results in less time.

Forgive us if we skip to, um, dessert, but for the last 10 minutes of every session, Cheung delivers a little slice of heaven. He calls it Stressage, half massage and half assisted stretching. He focuses on trigger points (those little knots of pain) and applies rolling pressure to every muscle, especially those along the spine, neck, and shoulders -- where tension sets up base camp. This post-workout drool session is actually good for you, too. ""It helps the body recover by realigning muscles,"" Cheung says.<br /><br /><b>Steal this : Foam Roller Lat and Shoulder Release</b><br />""Stretching on a foam roller lets you get the benefits of Stressage on your own,"" Cheung says. ""This particular exercise releases lats and shoulders, which get knotted up if you spend a lot of time at a computer.""<br /><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/images/secretstoptrainers/foam-roller.jpg"" /><br /><br /> <br /><b>Do It:</b> Lie on your left side on top of a foam roller positioned below the bottom of your armpit, forming a T with your body. Your left arm should be extended. Rest your right arm on your right side <b>(A).</b> Shift your body down to move the roller up along your armpit, moving steadily at about an inch per second. When you find a sharp, painful spot, rest there for 10 to 15 seconds. Once you reach the top of your armpit <b>(B),</b> roll back down and repeat once before switching sides.

His feats of strength and balance (we've seen him do one-arm pushups on a stability ball) are a testament to his system -- he calls it ""hybrid training"" -- which includes everything from rope climbing to power skipping. ""Combining methods like weight lifting, yoga, and plyometrics produces more well-rounded fitness results,"" Santana says. But one thing he believes every move must do: work your body through its full and natural range of motion. Most exercises challenge the body in two directions -- usually straight up and down -- which doesn't always prepare you for hoisting a Crate & Barrel delivery up the stairs or slicing an ace on the court.<br /><br /><b>Steal this : Side-to-side Chop</b><br />""The twist in this move helps reverse problems caused from sitting, which everyone does too much,"" Santana says.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/new-american-diet,Weight Loss,14,23,11,2,0,8,0,0,,Healthy Eating: Unlock Your Weight-Loss Power ,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1003-new-american-diet.jpg,"<p>In the book <em>The New American Diet</em>, <em>Men's Health</em> editor-at-large Stephen Perrine and coauthor Heather Hurlock blow the lid off the stealth diet crushers that scientists are just now understanding. They're called obesogens, nasty chemicals that act as fat-building catalysts, regardless of how often you hit the gym. <em>WH</em> sat down with Perrine to find out where obesogens lurk and how you can outsmart them.<br /><strong></strong></p><strong></strong><p><strong>What-and where-exactly are obesogens?</strong></p><p><em><strong>SP: </strong></em>They're natural or synthetic chemicals that disrupt the way your hormones operate. For example, leptin is the hormone that tells your body it's full; <a target=""_self"" href=""/nutrition/how-sugar-harms-you"">fructose</a>, an obesogen, can interfere with leptin and trick you into thinking you're starving right after a big meal. Some obesogens mimic the hormone estrogen, high levels of which promote fat storage. They're in plastics used in food packaging and other consumer goods. Many pesticides are obesogens, as are steroids and antibiotics fed to or injected into animals. Obesogens also occur naturally in soy.</p><p><strong>But if we're healthy, what's there to worry about?</strong></p><p><em><strong>SP:</strong></em> Obesogens make it much easier to become obese and to develop <a target=""_self"" href=""/nutrition/vitamin-c-and-diabetes"">diabetes</a>. Plus, researchers believe that some obesogens are changing the way our genes behave, causing our bodies to create not only more fat cells, but also larger ones that are more effective at storing fat. And some studies have indicated that the more obesogens a woman is exposed to during her pregnancy, the more likely her children are to be obese as adults.</p><p><strong>You say obesogens are in water. So we can put on weight while hydrating at the gym? </strong><br /><em><strong>SP: </strong></em>Well, that water probably traveled through PVC piping and contains traces of pesticides. And hard-plastic water bottles can contain the obesogen bisphenol A (BPA), which can leach into water. You need fluid, so the thing to do is cut down your overall exposure. <br /><strong><br />What about the soy you mentioned earlier? Isn't soy supposed to be good for you?<br /></strong><br /><em><strong>SP: </strong></em>Soy is great, but it does contain two natural hormones that act as obesogens. The big problem is we now have soy in everything. It's in many baked goods and even fried foods. Another offender? Fructose derived from corn. In my house, we don't allow anything that has high-fructose corn syrup. Cutting that one ingredient can change your body mass, because you're eliminating a massive amount of sugar from your diet. Go through your fridge and pantry; you'll be surprised by how much food contains soybean oil or highfructose corn syrup. </p><p><strong>Will that leave us with anything to eat? </strong><br /><em><strong>SP: </strong></em>The key is to focus not on all the foods you shouldn't eat, but rather on the 12 New American Diet superfoods. Look for sustainable fish and grass-fed, naturally raised chicken, beef, and pork that haven't been injected with hormones or antibiotics. Buy organic eggs and dairy products. Get food that comes in boxes or bags instead of BPA-lined cans. In terms of produce, generally look for organic versions of fruits with edible skin like apples, peaches, or pears; those with a tough skin, like avocados, bananas, and kiwi, are fine in conventional form. When you cut out obesogens and add in these high-nutrition foods, you can lose weight while eating however much you want. People who did our program for six weeks lost an average of 15 pounds, just by making simple swaps.</p><p><strong>Can you give us an ideal day on the New American Diet? </strong><br /><em><strong>SP:</strong></em> For breakfast, try a high-fiber cereal with low-fat organic milk, then have a snack of Greek yogurt with nuts. For lunch, lentil or bean soup is good; if you must have bread, make it whole grain. For dinner, eat organic chicken with a Caesar salad (use organic romaine). The bottom line is that everything is OK if you know its origin-even a cheesesteak. Just be sure the beef is grass-fed, the cheese is organic, and that the sandwich isn't made with refined white bread.<br /><strong></strong></p><strong></strong><p><strong>How do we know this isn't just another fad diet?</strong></p><p><em><strong>SP:</strong></em> A lot of diet rules we follow today are based on science from the '50s and '60s! We've ignored the fact that we've changed what we feed our livestock and how we grow our produce. We're still telling people it's healthy to have a salad with light dressing, but conventionally raised lettuce is often loaded with obesogens. And look at that dressing label. Often, the first ingredient is water, followed by high-fructose corn syrup. The point of this plan is to teach you how to swerve around weight-loss roadblocks by eating in a healthy, modern way.</p>",Celebrities

No, not in the bedroom! In your car. And the voice feeding you directives doesn't belong to your significant other-it emanates from your dashboard.</p><p>Yes, we're talking about the calm presence of your global positioning system (GPS). Where would you be without him, we mean, it? Probably driving around in circles.</p><p><b>Lazy Locators</b><br />Many drivers have become so attached to their navigation systems that they'd be lost-literally-if the get-me-there gadgetry stopped working. What's more, relying too much on technical assistance may be numbing people's noggins, according to a study by Veronique Bohbot, an associate professor of psychiatry at McGill University in Montreal. ""Becoming dependent on a GPS and no longer paying attention to the environment around you when you're going places can shrink your hippocampus-a section of the brain that helps with navigation and long-term memory-and compromise your own internal sense of direction,"" she says.</p><p>It's undeniable that some people have a stronger sense of direction than others, and to some extent, it's innate. But other factors influence how well people get their bearings. Some researchers believe that orientation is an acquired ability based on early experiences: Those raised in <a target=""_blank"">cities</a> learn to seek out familiar visual clues, such as landmarks, to figure out where they are, while people from rural areas tend to identify their whereabouts by examining the topography of the land (the slope of a hill, the shape of a forest boundary).</p><p><b>Kings of the Road?</b><br />Even our <a target=""_blank"">DNA</a> may play a part. Men, for example, are more likely to navigate intuitively and figure out where they are by using a cognitive map (examining the total lay of the land and sizing up where things are positioned in relation to one another) and computing metric distances (guesstimating how far they've traveled). Women, however, prefer to think logically by following routes and using landmarks to guide their way (drive two blocks, swing a right at the gas station), according to a study in the journal Nature Neuroscience. But regardless of how you navigate, there are easy ways to fine-tune your sense of direction.</p><p><i>Look at the big picture.</i><br />""Before navigating your way through a new environment, make a quick assessment of the topography by studying a map,"" says Mary Hegarty, a professor of psychology at the University of California at Santa Barbara. (In other words: Don't just zero Improve Your Inner Life Skills GPS in on your specific destination; study the area around it.) If you have a better sense of where everything is situated, you'll be able to reach your destination from any direction, rather than depending on a familiar path.</p><p><i>Test alternate routes.</i><br />""Being flexible is the key to good navigation,"" says Bob Burg, a cartographer in New Jersey. If you always go the same way from home to work, try a new route. Those without directional talents tend to memorize the left and right turns they need to make. But the directionally talented aren't tied down; they use their cognitive maps to explore many path possibilities.</p><p><i>Change your perspective.</i><br />Always losing your car in parking lots? Try this: While walking to the store's entrance, look back at your car every 15 seconds. ""Seeing it from different angles not only helps solidify its location in your memory but also shows you how to reach it from a variety of points,"" says Arne Ekstrom, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of California at Davis.<br /><i><br />Tell a story.</i><br />If memorization works best for you, bolster the route in your mind by creating a story using landmarks that you pass (Lisa, who works at the library, drove three blocks to fill up her SUV at the gas station, so she could make it to the church in time). And don't mindlessly follow directions; really think about the path you're taking, says Colin Ellard, author of You Are Here: Why We Can Find Our Way to the Moon, but Get Lost in the Mall. Keep track of the time that goes by-or the landmarks you pass-before you hit your exit.</p><p><i>Relax.</i><br />Studies show that people with a poor sense of direction experience more anxiety when navigating a new route. ""When panic sets in, people tend to move faster, which makes things worse,"" says Ellard. Take things slowly, and start off 15 minutes earlier for any trip, to account for any unplanned detours.<br /></p>",
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/emily-deschannel-talks-to-womens-health,Life,44,22,46,4,0,163,0,0,,Interview with Emily Deschanel,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0407-emily-deschanel-1520.jpg,"Emily Deschanel is 10 minutes late. Rushing through the door of a West Hollywood café in a short, flowy dress and 4-inch heels, she looks slim, gorgeous, and worried. ""I am so sorry,"" she says. ""I hope you weren't waiting long.""<br /><br />Okay, so she's clearly no diva, though given her famous family, that would be no surprise. Her dad is Oscar-nominated cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, who shot <i>The Right Stuff</i> and <i>Apocalypse Now</i>. Her mom is actress Mary Jo Weir, and her sister is starlet Zooey. But over the past 6 years, Deschanel, 30, has built up a résumé of her own, starting with a small role in the 2002 miniseries <i>Rose Red</i>, which led to bit parts in <i>Cold Mountain</i> and <i>Spider-Man 2</i> and appearances on a smattering of TV dramas. In 2005, she finally scored the lead in the genuinely hair-raising Boogeyman.<br /><br />Now she's forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan on <i>Bones</i>, a role that allows her to play a three-dimensional human. ""I love that she's a strong, intelligent woman who has flaws,"" says Deschanel, referring to Brennan's tendency to treat victims like math problems. Lack of emotion isn't an issue in her real life: She's too sensitive to eat a hamburger and has cried over missing a line. Good thing she's toughening up...<br /><br /><b>I assume those heels aren't leather, because you're a vegan, right?</b><br />They're by Stella McCartney. All of her shoes are <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-success-story-12"">vegan</a>. I've been a vegan for about 15 years. I went to a pretty liberal high school, and we watched <i>Diet for a New America</i> [a 1987 exposé on how food choices affect health and the environment]. And I just stopped eating and wearing animal products after that.<br /><br /><b>Did you grow up in one of those no sugar-cereal families?</b><br />Totally. No sugar cereal. Hot dogs with no nitrates. We weren't allowed to have McDonald's. When the babysitter came, we could have Kraft macaroni and cheese.<br /><br /><b>Would you ever throw paint on anyone's fur coat?</b><br />No. But I think I can convince anyone to become a vegetarian. [<i>Bones</i> costar] David Boreanaz used to make fun of me for being a vegan, but then I started giving him vegan food to eat, and he loves it. Now he tries to eat vegetarian 1 day a week.<br /><br /><b>Do you practice yoga too?</b><br />I used to, but now I'm so busy that it stresses me out. All I can think the whole time is, ""How long am I going to be here?"" The last class I took was with my sister, who, by the way, used to be annoyed that I was so into yoga. The teacher was so slow I wanted to strangle her. That's not very Zen!<br /><br /><b>So how do you manage to fit into all those cute pants you wear on the show?</b><br />I have a treadmill, and I work out with my trainer, Julie Diamond, as often as possible. She's so positive. She's never like, ""Move your fat butt!"" It's more like, ""Think of how you'll feel when you're in great shape."" And she's right. There are weeks when I don't exercise at all, and I don't feel good.<br /><br /><b>What motivates you to get on the treadmill?</b><br />For me, it always has to be about health. That's why I'm a vegan. Well, I don't even do that for my health entirely, I do it for animals. The point is, there always has to be a better reason than looking good, or I won't stick with it.<br /><br /><b>Your <i>Bones</i> character strives for perfection. Do you?</b><br />Yes, especially when I first started the show. It was a very emotional time for me personally. I had just gone through a breakup, and I had started this big job that demanded a lot of me. After 15-hour days and no sleep, if I didn't know a line I would just break down crying. Now I'm a lot more understanding of myself.<br /><br /><b>Were you always a perfectionist?</b><br />I was a hostess in a restaurant in New York when I was 21, and I was too good of an employee. I was putting most of my energy into that instead of acting. But my father told my sister and me to look at whatever needed to be done and do that job well, no matter what it was.<br /><br /><b>What else do you and your sister have in common?</b><br />We both tend not to pay much attention to what's socially acceptable, and we like to do crazy stuff. We both love to dance and will dance whenever, wherever, whether there's music playing or not. My whole family is very sarcastic and constantly making jokes.<br /><br /><b>How are you two different?</b><br />In seventh grade this kid didn't invite Zooey to his bar mitzvah. And she went right up to him and shouted, ""Why didn't you invite me to your bar mitzvah?"" I just love that. She is fearless. I would have called my mom crying.<br /><br /><b>Is your mother a good shoulder to cry on?</b><br />She's wonderful and sympathetic, but she's not just going to listen to you complain. Whenever I was considering giving up acting entirely, she'd remind me that life is hard and that the world doesn't owe you anything. You have to work your butt off to get your dreams. She'll make you take action - which I think is a good thing. You can enable people to wallow if you just listen and don't encourage them to change.<br /><br /><b>You must be pretty fearless too.</b><br />Yes, because acting is 99 percent rejection. I really wanted this role in <i>Bones</i>, but I've had to learn not to be too invested so I don't collapse on the floor when something doesn't work out. But I was definitely jumping around my apartment when I got it.<br /><br /><b>Your career is taking off. How's the personal life?</b><br />I have a boyfriend - he's British, a screenwriter, and a vegetarian. We've been together for over a year. We met through friends and would see each other here and there, and later he asked me to coffee.<br /><br /><b>Wedding bells?</b><br />We don't even live together - we've really taken it slow. I think a lot of women can lose themselves in a relationship and forget who they are and what they want. I've definitely done it. I don't make time for myself, or I make little compromises. I think women feel obligated to compromise. That can be a good thing, but often we take it too far. I had a boyfriend who smoked around me all the time. I respected his choice, but I gave up something very important to me - my health. You give and give, and one day you realize you gave up things you need. Or you just never asked for them. I don't want to do that right now. My sister and I just bought a duplex together in West Hollywood, and I think it's time to just have some fun.<br />",Celebrities

It's getting there that's the problem. Like at the end of the workday, which suddenly becomes the perfect time to check the supply cabinet, IM about <i>Desperate Housewives</i>, and - damn, look at the time; you'll get that workout in tomorrow. Why are we paying personal trainers after we get to the gym? What we really need them to do is carry us there. Your motivation needs motivating, so we asked top trainers and athletes to help you firm up your resolve - and your glutes, thighs, and abs - with these stick-to-your-workout strategies. <br /><br /><p><b>1. Get in Over Your Head </b><br /><br />Sign up for a race and give yourself a reason to train. ""After I retired, it was hard to motivate myself to work out, so I set a goal to run a marathon,"" says Olympian Nikki Stone, the 1998 gold medalist in aerial freestyle skiing. ""It gives you something to work toward."" Just be sure to set realistic goals - winning your age group in a 5-K or teaming up with two friends for a triathlon relay. Otherwise, you can wind up more discouraged than inspired. If you want help before you jump into a live race, ask for it. Most running clubs sponsor organized training runs, which match you with groups of your skill level and prepare you for specific races and distances. <br /></p><p><b>2. Cut a Soundtrack </b><br /><br />""Whenever I do cardio, I listen to something that gets me going,"" says Emily Copeland, a professional wakeboarder, who won gold at the 2002 X Games. Rip a playlist with music that gets you pumped up; leave off the slow tracks. Upbeat music makes a workout seem easier and go by faster, according to a study led by Ronald W. Deitrick, Ph.D., director of exercise science at the University of Scranton. That's because high-tempo music is a better distractor, Dr. Deitrick says. ""It helps you block out the sensations you have regarding pain and effort.""  <b>3. Book It</b><br /><br />""You'll never find the time - you've got to make the time,"" says Chuck Wolf, manager of sport science and human performance at the USA Triathlon National Training Center in Clermont, Florida. While that seems obvious, lack of planning continues to be the biggest reason people fail to work out, Wolf says. He suggests keeping a calendar and scheduling workouts - strength, cardio, yoga, new classes you want to try - at least a week in advance. Before you set foot in the locker room, have an agenda: which exercises you're going to do, what order, and how many sets and reps. Have a contingency plan, too - lifting dumbbells or jumping rope for 20 minutes at home - in case the unexpected cancels your workout. ""You're 40 percent more likely to work out if you have strategies to help you overcome the obstacles,"" says Rod Dishman, Ph.D., an exercise scientist at the University of Georgia. <br /></p><p><b>4. Get a Buy-in</b><br /><br />Whether it's a husband, child, or boyfriend, you're going to need support from anyone who has a claim on your time. Make an agreement with them: 4 or 5 days a week, you're entitled to 1 all-about-you hour to work out. ""Since it's for your health, it's a contract they can't refuse,"" says Darren Steeves, a trainer in Nova Scotia, Canada. ""That will allow you to exercise guilt-free."" Better still, make the deal a united effort and see if you can get him to work on his soft spots, too.<br /><br /><b>5. Start with Squats </b><br />No one loves this exercise. But the payoff in places where you're seeking results (glutes, hips, thighs) is unquestioned. And starting your strength-training program with your most dreaded exercise will help you finish strong. ""You'll look forward to your favorite moves at the end of your workout, which will encourage you to complete the entire session,"" says John Williams, a trainer in Atlanta.<br /><br /><b>6 Ask a Friend </b><br />If you'd rather hit the snooze button than the treadmill, try some friendly intervention. Having a friend waiting for you at the gym three mornings a week will get you out of bed. ""If you've made a commitment to someone, you have a tendency to keep it,"" says Tristan Gale, winner of the 2002 Olympic gold medal for women's skeleton (barreling head first down a bobsled track). But that doesn't necessarily mean your best friend is also your best workout partner. Look for someone who's on the same fitness level and has similar goals. ""If there's too much of a disparity, no one will get a good workout,"" Wolf says. <br /><br /><b>7. Just Show Up </b><br />On really low-energy days, head to the gym with the promise that you can leave after you finish your warmup. ""Tell yourself you'll just do some stretches and a few minutes of cardio,"" says Rachel Cosgrove, a personal trainer in Newhall, California. ""Once you get to the gym and get your blood pumping, chances are you'll finish your full workout. Ninety percent of the time, our clients do."" <br /><br /><b>8. Target Your Heart</b><br />High cholesterol isn't just a problem for men; heart disease is the No. 1 killer of women, claiming 500,000 lives each year, according to the American Heart Association. Make sure a cholesterol test is part of your annual checkup, and follow up with your doctor on the results. Find out what your cholesterol levels are and what they should be. Then work toward meeting that target by exercising regularly. ""You'll decrease your risk of heart disease while providing yourself with a very important, concrete goal,"" says John Thyfault, Ph.D., an exercise scientist and trainer at East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina. <br /><br /><b>9. Be Defensive </b><br />Need more inspiration than trimming your waistline? Consider enrolling in a self-defense class, which will increase your confidence and your heart rate. Learning practical defense skills - eye strikes, heel palms, knees to the groin - is a workout that will also bolster your sense of control, says Dana Schwartz, who teaches self-defense at Prepare Inc. in New York City. ""You get to fight every class, and every class you see improvement in yourself,"" Schwartz says. ""I think people are surprised by how powerful they are."" About 10,000 butt-kicking women nationwide take Prepare's 20-hour class. <br /><br /><b>10. Invest in a Trainer</b><br />If you don't know what you're doing when you get to the gym, it pays to hire someone who does. Beyond helping you plan your workout, a personal trainer will observe and correct your form to make sure you produce results and avoid injuries. ""They'll spot you through the movements, so you can really feel what muscles [are working],"" says Brenda Powell, a certified trainer and general manager of the Institute of Human Performance in Boca Raton, Florida. ""For a lot of muscle groups - like the glutes and lower back, for example - our bodies really don't know how to isolate them correctly. It's often difficult to do that without proper instruction."" <br /><br /><b>11. Don't Do It</b><br />You hate fish, but that doesn't mean you stop eating. The same is true for your workout. ""If I'm going to recommend exercise, I can say running is the best,"" Dr. Deitrick says. ""But if a person doesn't like running, guess what? They're not going to do it. They don't care what the benefit is."" The ""perfect"" exercise is the one you're happy doing, and you have plenty of options, indoors and out. So don't suffer through a less-than-stimulating routine. Find an exercise you like - cycling, yoga, hiking, that rowing machine in the corner of the gym that no one ever uses - and you'll find yourself wanting to exercise. <br /><br /><b>12. Watch the Rut</b><br />You found the perfect routine - great. Just be sure not to make it as familiar as <i>Friends</i> reruns. What bores your mind also bores your body; you need variety to guarantee results like fat loss and muscle tone. If you do the same three-sets-of-eight circuit week after week, you'll stop challenging your body around Week 4, and progress will quickly plateau. ""When you impose a stress on your body, your body adapts to it,"" says Tom Holland, exercise physiologist and author of <i>The Truth About How to Get in Shape</i>. Switch your routine - do different strength or cardio moves, or take a new class - every 4 to 6 weeks to keep yourself fresh. <br /><br /><b>13. Write it Down</b><br />Write your fitness goals in a journal, and track your workouts. Include the usual stats, such as specific exercises, duration, weight, sets, and reps. Write down your perceptions, too. ""Think: Am I having fun, or does it feel like work?"" says Sara Ivanhoe, instructor of the <i>Yoga for Dummies</i> VHS/DVD series. Determine the exercises that make you feel good and produce results, and note the stressors that tend to derail workouts. ""It's a good opportunity to explore what gets in the way of being consistent,"" Ivanhoe says, whether it's a traffic jam at the leg-press machine at the same time every night or too much time chatting with friends.<br /><br /><b>14. Work with Him</b><br />""Eighty percent of couples who divorce say they grew apart,"" says Pat Love, Ed.D, a relationship therapist and coauthor of <i>Hot Monogamy</i>. ""Sharing activities is a surefire way to stick together. Especially activities where you both end up feeling good and energized."" Stone is a believer. She regularly jogs with her husband, and they take their English sheepdog for long walks. ""We get quality time together - and a workout,"" she says. Exercise releases neurohormones that make people feel happier, more motivated, and less anxious, Dr. Love says. ""And anytime you have a pleasurable experience when you're with your partner, your brain associates him with pleasure."" <br /><br /><b>15. Streak! </b><br />No, don't sprint out of the locker room naked. See how many days you can go without missing a workout, and then try to beat your record. ""Every time your streak ends, strive to set a longer mark in your new attempt,"" Williams says. <br /><br /><b>16. Reward Yourself</b><br />You worked for 2 months to reach your goal, and yesterday you ran your first sub-8:30 mile. Celebrate by treating yourself - to a facial, a massage, a long, hot bath - whatever you want (see ""Four Ways to Reward Yourself"" at left for more ideas). But don't let the moment pass. Because sometimes, that short-term reward might be the only evidence of your long-term success, says Jacqueline Wagner, a certified trainer in New York City. ""Some of the things we see in exercise in terms of maintaining balance, of maintaining bone mass, of maintaining function, we're not going to see for years down the road,"" Wagner says. A deep-tissue massage, on the other hand, can make you feel good right now. <br /><br /><b>17. Play the percentages </b><br />Have your body-fat level measured every few months to gauge your fitness progress. ""You'll actually have numbers that you can shoot for, and something that you can definitely measure, as opposed to, 'I just want my abs to look better,'"" says Tim Kuebler, a certified trainer in Kansas City, Missouri. A body-fat percentage from the high teens to mid-20s is considered healthy for most women (ranges vary by age), according to the American College of Sports Medicine. A trainer can estimate your percentage using calipers, and most gyms offer this service for a minimal charge; just have the same person do it each time, as measurement techniques can vary. <br /><br /><b>18. Take a Chance</b><br />Boost your adrenaline with a workout that challenges both your body and your fears - rock climbing, for example, or whitewater kayaking. Besides being great exercise, such adrenaline-spiked adventures will help you better manage stress in everyday life, according to a study from Texas A&M University. Adventure sports raise your levels of adrenaline and the stress hormone cortisol, and also provide you with an immediate way - exercise - to efficiently work that stress out. The fitter you are, the study found, the better you handle stress.<br /><br /><b>19. Run Away </b><br />Sign up for a race in another time zone. ""Once you've paid for the airfare and a hotel room, you'll have extra incentive to follow your training plan,"" says Carolyn Ross-Toren, chairwoman of the Mayor's Fitness Council in San Antonio, Texas.

Show Off</b><br />A boost to your appearance - be it a new haircut or fresh-out-of-the-box running shoes - can give you a lift in the gym. ""Sometimes, those little things can be very uplifting and motivating,"" Wagner says. ""And when you feel better about yourself, you're going to function better.<br /></p>",Getting Started

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/dna-profile,Health,40,22,33,1,0,0,1,0,,Should You Get a DNA Test?,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1010-dna.jpg,"<p>Here's the thing: I snoop for my Christmas presents. I read the last page of a novel first. I found out the sex of my children the very day their little-boy parts dangled into view. I even devour horoscopes-not because I'm certain the universe holds the key to my life, but because it just might. So when <i>WH</i> asked if I would consider learning which diseases could eventually take me out, I had only two words: <i>Hell yes</i>.<br /><br /><br /><br />And so, on my 39th birthday (""Stay positive!"" beseeches my horoscope), I tear open a glossy package from 23andMe, a California-based personal genetics company that sells $429 testing kits online. I spend the next five minutes hawking up sputum like a teenage boy; I need enough saliva to top off a test tube, no air bubbles allowed. As I vigorously work my mouth, I think about the different illnesses-diabetes, cancer, heart disease-that killed off my relatives, and whether or not these ailments are hiding deep in my own DNA.<br /><br /><br /><br />I shove the vial into a plastic specimen bag, stick it in a padded envelope, and hustle down to FedEx. <i>This is way better than Christmas</i>, I think. In six weeks I'll be staring at a blueprint for my health future.<br /><br /><br /><br />Used to be, someone who wanted to take a peek at her genetic makeup had to visit a clinical geneticist for a series of very expensive, specific tests. But now anybody can bypass the <a href=""/health/top-doctors-for-women"">best doctors</a>-and their offices-and get a wide-ranging health report through one of dozens of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing companies. It's an industry that's expanding at an exponential pace.<br /><br /><br /><br />While DTC technology is relatively cheap and simple-tests are processed on small glass slides called gene chips that can scan some half million sites on the human genome-the cost-effectiveness comes with a hidden price: hard-to-interpret results. 23andMe, for example, tests for 163 health conditions and diseases and arranges your results in ""risk"" categories (elevated, average, decreased). It also puts stars next to the results it's extra-confident in-i.e., ample science backs up the disease-gene connection-and then attaches percentages to the illnesses you're most likely to get. Confused yet?<br /><br /><br /><br />What's more, a few diseases, such as Huntington's, are 100 percent genetic (if you carry the gene, you'll develop the illness), but most are more complex and difficult to test for, says geneticist George Church, Ph.D., of Harvard Medical School. Cancer, for example, is likely the outcome of a mash-up of inherited genes, hormones gone haywire, and exposure to environmental carcinogens.<br /><br /><br /><br />And although DNA research is forging ahead at breakneck pace (one recent study found 150 genetic variants that may increase our chances of living to 100), the DTC field remains poorly standardized and largely unregulated. To wit, when Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Institutes of Health, took three separate DTC tests, he received three different risk assessments-high, average, and low-for prostate cancer. And this May, when Walgreens started stocking its shelves with the world's first such retail kits, the FDA stepped in with a ruling: The government now considers these tests medical devices, which means they need regulatory approval. Walgreens yanked the boxes, and a week later Congress launched an official investigation.<br /><br /><br /><br />Leave it to my coolly analytical husband to kill my crystal-ball buzz with some rational perspective. What if, he asks, I find out that I carry the BRCA mutations for breast and ovarian cancers, which could increase my chances of getting the diseases by up to 60 percent? Would I run straight to the hospital and have my breasts removed? (And should we immediately beef up our life insurance?) What if the test predicts I might get Parkinson's, a disease that has no cure? Look at Olivia Wilde's character on <i>House</i>, he reminds me, who after finding out she carries the Huntington's gene goes on a casual-sex binge.<br /><br /><br /><br />Valid points, all. And while my curiosity trumped my prudence, I'm starting to feel a little unhinged. I mean, I think I'm healthy-and I often live as if I'm indestructible-but what if I'm not? What if there's a ticking time bomb buried in my genetic code? I revisit 23andMe's site and scroll though warnings such as ""this knowledge is irrevocable"" and ""it may provoke strong emotion."" Gulp.<br /><br /><br /><br />""Learning about genetic risks is serious; this is real medical information,"" says Liz Kearney, president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors. It's information some experts believe the average person might not be able to contextualize or be emotionally prepared to handle. ""There are a lot of repercussions to finding out,"" adds Sofia Merajver, M.D., Ph.D., director of the breast and ovarian cancer risk and evaluation program at the University of Michigan. She has seen women fall into serious depression after learning they carry risky genes, and most DTC companies don't provide counseling. ""These results are potentially harmful if not interpreted by a genetic counselor,"" says Merajver. ""Without counseling, some people might take good care of themselves, but others might react in ways that could end up being harmful."" Besides, women already know they need to engage in healthy behaviors like eating right and exercising regularly.<br /><br /><br /><br />Whether they do, of course, is another story. ""I think these companies are providing a great service,"" argues Raju Kucherlapati, Ph.D., a member of the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. ""If you <i>know</i> you might be susceptible to an illness, you might really change your lifestyle."" DTC test results might also raise awareness that diseases don't have to run in your family in order to be genetically rooted, he adds.<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Six weeks after mailing off my spittle, I'm downloading photos from a weekend fly-fishing trip to Maine, glass of pinot grigio in hand, when an e-mail pops up from 23andMe: <i>Your Genetic Profile Is Ready</i>. My heart beats wildly in anticipation.<br /><br /><br /><br />And then it beats wildly in panic. I find 11 entries piled up in my ""elevated risk"" category. Among them: bladder cancer, leukemia, stroke-potentially deadly conditions that, as far as I know, have never struck anyone in my family. Above those, marked with large yellow ""confidence"" stars, are ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis, and Crohn's disease (again, no family history). To make matters worse, there are flaming red percentages next to them. I'm almost twice as likely to get Crohn's as the average person; same thing with MS. And I'm three times as likely to get ulcerative colitis, a disease I've never even heard of. I click on its tab and read that it's an inflammatory bowel disorder with no known cause. Or cure.<br /><br /><br /><br />A bit shakily, I then notice two ""locked"" reports, one for breast cancer and one for Parkinson's (23andMe hides these behind an additional step in order to give customers a last chance to consider whether they really want to know their risks). Terrified that I am about to be leveled by devastating news, I click ahead and find-after signing a waiver to view my results-I do not carry three common BRCA mutations for breast and ovarian cancers, nor the mutation in my LRRK2 gene for Parkinson's. <i>Phew</i>. But waiting to find out nearly gave me a heart attack (for which I apparently have a decreased risk).<br /><br /><br /><br />I'm left feeling befuddled and somewhat nervous. Should I be really freaked that my colon and rectum might someday become riddled with disease (wait, was that abdominal pain I felt last week?), or that the nerves in my brain and spinal cord could soon be crippled with MS? Thanking my lucky stars I'm a journalist with access, I dial up Joanna Mountain, Ph.D., a former Stanford University geneticist who is now the senior director of research at 23andMe. ""You have all the risky versions of the gene variants for ulcerative colitis,"" she says. ""But the overall frequency for the disease is quite rare-so even if your chances are tripled, it's highly unlikely you'll get it."" Mildly reassuring, but I still don't see how 23andMe can be ""confident"" in the link between my genes and this disease, while also admitting that genes may not even play a big role in getting sick. ""We are confident there is a connection, while also knowing there are other factors,"" explains Mountain.<br /><br /><br /><br />And that's my biggest beef with my newfound DNA info: the ""other factors."" According to my report, I'm at a decreased risk for melanoma (even though I'm a baby-oiled product of the 1980s Jersey shore); typical risk for lung cancer (though they have no idea if I inhale two packs a day); and typical risk for type 2 diabetes (complications from which killed three of my grandparents). It seems to me the info is nearly useless without pairing it with lifestyle and family-history data. Indeed, geneticist Church concurs that without these factors you won't get the full picture and you must be careful when interpreting results.<br /><br /><br /><br />Perhaps that's why 23andMe recently added access to independent genetic counseling-for up to $375-and envisions working up detailed personal-history questionnaires to be taken online. The company is also collecting vast sums of genetic data that it hopes to use to advance the pace of research and, eventually, affect the future of medicine.<br /><br /><br /><br />In the end, I wish I had waited until the promise of genetic testing matched up with the reality. Results in hand, I don't see any lifestyle changes I could make even if I were so inclined-the diseases for which I have an increased genetic risk currently have unknown behavioral and environmental triggers.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>In the meantime</i>, I think as I open the newspaper and flip to my horoscope, <i>I'm just glad I'm not a hypochondriac</i>.<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p>",relationships

I'm here to take the store's ""sex educator"" employee training, and I'm feeling resistant. The truth is, I've never set foot in a sex shop. </p><p>My supervisor for the two-day training is Babeland's sex education coordinator, Audrey McManus. She's a veritable sunflower of a woman, but facing me, she clouds over.</p><p>""You write about sex, and you've <i>never</i> been in a sex shop? Isn't that, like, part of your job?"" </p><p>""Look, Audrey,"" I say. ""I know where my clitoris is, and with all due respect, I can probably find yours as well."" </p><p>I indicate a lacquer tray with a couple of boomerang-shaped vibrators designed to stimulate the <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/the-best-sex-position"">G-spot</a>. They're pretty and colorful, but I'm almost sure I don't have a G-spot, and I don't care. I pick up a Rabbit. (The Rabbit, in case you missed the famous <i>Sex and the City</i> episode, is a vibrator with a rotating head for penetration and wiggling attachments for clitoral stimulation.) ""I mean, if you taught this thing how to operate a cash register, it could work here."" </p><p>Audrey blinks at me. She doesn't think I'm cute or funny. She picks up a <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/sex-toy-or-household-object-quiz"">sex toy</a> large enough to bludgeon a school of hammerhead sharks and, like a dirty schoolmarm, smacks it against her hand. ""Now, let's get started with a little anatomy lesson."" </p><p>I'm corralled into a tiny office with some Georgia O'Keeffe stuff on the walls, some Asian erotic whatnot. ""That's a 16th-century Japanese woodblock print depicting female ejaculation,"" Audrey explains. I'm relieved all I see is a walrus lying in bed brushing his teeth. Audrey pins up a diagram of a vagina. I'm expecting ""Here's where you pee out of, here's where you do it,"" but this has so many lines and zones it looks more like a map of the Chesapeake Bay. I dutifully point out the clitoris and the G-spot. She starts talking about how I said I don't have one. ""I think you probably do,"" she says. She points out the urethra-the tube in front of the vaginal opening where urine exits the body. ""This entire passageway is wrapped with erectile tissue,"" she says. ""People make the mistake of looking for only the G-<i>spot</i>-when it's not just a spot but part of a whole sensitive area. And sometimes that area-the lower part of the front wall of the vagina-needs to be stroked before you can even find the G-spot.""</p><p>Audrey pauses. ""Are you blushing?""</p><p>""Of course not,"" I say. ""I did not know that.""</p><p>I get a brief smile, for humility, I guess. ""Now we're moving on to lube,"" Audrey says. </p><p>I am about to tell Audrey that I am afraid that even touching lube will bring on early menopause. And that so far, I don't have any, uh, problems, when-splat-I've been slimed. ""Rub your fingers together,"" Audrey says. The entire Babeland staff has gathered around, each eager to show me a favorite brand of lube and offer up some of their <a href=""/sex-and-relationships"">sex tips</a>. Status likes Maximus. ""It's nice and thick,"" he says. Audrey is partial to Sliquid Silk, a water-based lube. ""Doesn't that feel like your own natural wetness? Taste it,"" she says. </p><p>Still reeling from hearing the phrase ""own natural wetness"" spoken out loud, I manage a polite ""No, thank you."" </p><p>""It's not a request. Some customer will want to know the right lube for oral sex and you have to-""</p><p>I taste it. It tastes, as promised, like nothing. </p><p>""Sliquid is one of our most popular scent-free and creamy lubes,"" I say in my best infomercialese. </p><p>Audrey's smile turns up a few watts. ""That's good,"" she says. ""But you're still not ready to work the floor.""</p><p>Next, I dutifully undergo a lecture on 25 brands of condoms. My vibrator lesson is shorter than you might think-turns out I really do understand the clitoris. But then something weird happens.</p><p>I pick up a Hitachi Magic Wand. Audrey gasps. She can tell from my tender handling of it that we have a past. </p><p>""Why didn't you just tell me?"" Audrey says. </p><p>I confess that I was too embarrassed to admit I used to own a vibrator. </p><p>Audrey laughs. ""So, how did you like that Hitachi Magic Wand?""</p><p>I sigh. ""It's like a Lincoln Town Car-it picks you up and takes you where you want to go, and all you need to do is look out the window and watch the scenery get better and better."" </p><p>Audrey is so proud of my little breakthrough that after a day and a half of training, she finally lets me work in the store. My first customer is a dude who tells me he's afraid that if his girlfriend gets off with a vibrator she won't want to have intercourse with him anymore. I assure him that there's absolutely zero chance of that happening-that what people like about sex is contact and closeness, and perhaps he would like to buy a vibrating ring that they can use together? A middle-aged guy comes in complaining that his condoms hurt his wife, and we find a better-fitting brand. Then we start talking, and I tell him what Audrey told me, about the G-spot being more than just a tiny spot. He is delighted. Then a married couple comes in. They're totally hot for each other, but a medication she's taking is giving her dryness issues. I remember the lube combination-Sliquid Silk with a silicone-based lube, either Eros or Pink-that's best for serious dryness. They run out of the store smiling, with their hands all over each other's butts. </p><p>""Oh my God,"" I say after they've gone. ""You guys, like, actually help people live happier lives! You give people the tools to make sex better."" Before this moment, I honestly believed that sex didn't qualify as good if it needed ""enhancements.""</p><p>On my last day, Audrey makes a YouTube video of me talking about a vibrator called the Laya Spot. In simple, straightforward tones I describe how it works, how its pulsating motion provides great stimulation. </p><p>""Wow,"" Audrey says. ""I can't believe you made it through without making a joke.""</p><p>""I know. Aren't you proud of me?""</p><p>Audrey shrugs and says, ""You know what would really make me proud?""</p><p>She hands me a giant bottle of lube. I want to say no, but if I've learned nothing else this week it's that lube is where it's at. Reluctantly, I agree to try it. </p><p>When I call Audrey a few days later to tell her that, ahem, the lube fulfilled its promise, she says, ""I'm so proud of you! You have to tell everyone! I'm going to put you on speaker phone!"" Are you <i>kidding</i> me!? I can hear the staff calling out questions about which brand I liked, had my orgasm been better, if I had found my G-spot. I can't bring myself to answer. ""Hello? Hello? I can't hear you!"" I shout, and end the call.</p><p>Maybe I'll head to the bedroom to see if I can find my G-spot before it sneaks off to file negligence charges.</p><p><b>Shy No More</b><br />Want to be bolder between the sheets?

To decide what to wear to the interview, you've got to scope out the company culture. You can do that by checking out the company's website or, if possible, doing some recon in the parking lot to see how everyone is dressed as they head into the office. A suit and closed-toe shoes are musts for formal environments. For casual workplaces, you can't go wrong with a pencil skirt, a pretty blouse, and pumps. Then do one thing that will make you stand out from the crowd. ""Try adding a memorable accessory to your outfit,"" says Susan V. Fried, chief officer of recruitment and development at K&L Gates LLP, an international law firm. ""I'll remember a person who was carrying a great bag or wearing a striking but tasteful necklace.""<br /><br /></p><p><strong>8:55 a.m.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Zip it.</strong> Even if you were doing 90 miles an hour to arrive on time, don't let it show. Huffing and puffing, fumbling with your keys, or jamming things into your purse makes you look unprepared, so have your bag zipped and remove the sunglasses from your head, advises Brandi Blades, vice president of marketing at Brill Street, a Chicago company that connects employers with employees. And the iPhone is off, right?<br /><br /><br /></p><p><strong>9:07 a.m. </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Get a grip.</strong> ""The number-one thing is poise-it transcends both age and experience,"" says Andrew Essex, CEO of Droga5, a New York City ad agency whose clients include Puma. ""Before your mouth even opens, look me in the eye and shake my hand."" BTW: A nice, firm handshake isn't just a requirement for the Y-chromosome set. In a 2008 University of Iowa study, women with firm grips received higher ratings than men with equally strong handshakes. So don't limpfish it: Grab the interviewer's hand firmly, making sure the web between your thumb and first finger meets theirs, pump once or twice, then let go, says Donna Goldfeder, director of career services for Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.<br /><br /><br /></p><p><strong>9:10 a.m.</strong></p><p><br /><strong>Dazzle with small talk. </strong>Go in prepared with a couple of lines you could say while the interviewer is walking you to her office or as you're settling in. A simple ""Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today"" is always a safe bet, according to principal image consultant Michelle T. Sterling, founder of Global Image Group. Or comment on something interesting you noticed in the office or around the building.<br /><br /><br /></p><p><strong>9:16 a.m.</strong></p><p><br /><strong>Appear riveted.</strong> Lean forward slightly (it instantly makes you appear more interested) and maintain eye contact. ""Some people tend to glance all over the place and aren't even aware they're doing it,"" says Carole Martin, an interview coach in San Diego and the author of <em>Boost Your Interview IQ</em>.<br /><br /><br /></p><p><strong>9:24 a.m.</strong><br /> <br /><br /><strong>Brag a bit. </strong>The big thing in HR circles these days is ""behavioral questioning"" (basically, the interviewer asks how you've handled certain situations, assuming that past behavior will offer hints of future success). Give specifics, says Goldfeder. Don't just say you saved the company cash-explain how your new processing system saved a cool $100,000.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p><p><strong>9:29 a.m.</strong><br /> <br /><br /><strong>Nail ""The Question.""</strong> What's your biggest weakness? Saying you don't have any makes you sound cocky; saying too much undermines your ability. So use the sandwich technique, says Martin. Begin with a positive statement, followed by a negative one, then end with another positive. If your weakness is an inability to create visual presentations, say that while you're technologically savvy (positive), you haven't mastered PowerPoint yet (negative), but are taking a class to get better (positive).<br /><br /><br /></p><p><strong>9:33 a.m.</strong><br /> <br /><br /><strong>Turn the tables.</strong> Almost all interviewers will throw it back to you at the end and ask if you have any questions. Use this as an opportunity to say something impressive:<br /><br /><br /></p><p><strong>""You said earlier that you're starting a new campaign. What inspired this?""</strong></p><p>""Mentioning something that was brought up during the interview shows you were paying attention,"" Martin says. And asking specific questions about the company demonstrates that you're interested enough to have read up on the latest news. (P.S. The company website and a Google search are your resources for such details.)<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>""What did you find most challenging when you started in this field?""</strong><br /><br />""Simply put, people like to talk about themselves,"" says Barbara Corcoran, founder of the New York City-based real estate company The Corcoran Group.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>""Do you have any doubts that I can do this job?""</strong><br /><br />It may seem counterintuitive, but getting the interviewer to bring up potential problems she has with your credentials will allow you to address the issues. This way, you have a chance to make your case and swing those doubts in your favor, says Martin.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>9:42 a.m.</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>Let them know you really want it. </strong>""People think that being eager paints them in a desperate light,"" Goldfeder says, ""but most recruiters love enthusiasm."" So before you leave, say, ""After hearing more details, I'm very interested in the job."" Follow up the same day with an e-mail thank-you, or better yet, a handwritten note on personal stationery (write neatly and check your spelling!). Mail it ASAP since snail mail takes a few days.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>",

Not so much. Indoor air may be the grimiest stuff our lungs filter each day. Studies show that things like candles, printers, and even shoes can fill your rooms with harmful contaminants, says Ted Myatt, Sc.D., an environmental scientist in Boston. But there's no need to live in a tent in your backyard-just follow these easy steps to lighten the load on your respiratory system.</p><p><strong>The Pollutant: Candles</strong><br />Sure, they make for a cozy ambience, but when you light one made from paraffin-as most candles are-you're potentially harming your health. Researchers at South Carolina State University found that paraffin candles emit chemicals that are linked to liver damage, neurological problems, and leukemia. They can also release a black soot that, over time, may damage your lung and heart tissue, says Jeffrey May, an expert on indoor air quality and author of <em>My House Is Killing Me: The Home Guide for Families with Allergies and Asthma</em>.</p><p>All the major air pollutants (car exhaust, factory fumes, sidewalk smokers) are outside, right?

If you can't avoid burning paraffin, do so only occasionally and in a draft-free area. And cut out the heavily fragranced jar-style versions, says May; they produce more soot.</p><p><strong>The Pollutant: Printers</strong><br />Printers spit out more than just expense reports and flight confirmations-they also spray around lots of microparticles of ink, toner, and ozone, a lung irritant. A recent Australian study found that about one-third of printers are ""high emitters,"" which means they churn out as many harmful airborne particles as you'd find on a traffic-clogged street.</p><p><strong>The solution:</strong> Set up your printer in a well-ventilated area and try to stand at least 10 feet away from it during a lengthy job (good advice for when you're at the office too). And remember to print in black-and-white whenever you can, because color ink produces more noxious debris. To see if your printer is on the high-emitter list, visit the International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health online at <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ilaqh.qut.edu.au"">www.ilaqh.qut.edu.au</a>.</p><p><strong>The Pollutant: Dust</strong><br />Those gray tumbleweeds rolling around along your baseboards and under your bed are packed with pollen and zillions of your dead skin cells. They're also the first step in the food chain for dust mites and other insects (gross!) and a breeding ground for mold (grosser!). All that can spell a big headache, quite literally, for women prone to allergies, says May.</p><p><strong>The solution:</strong> Sweep a vacuum with a high-energy particulate airborne (HEPA) filter over your floors once a week, and wipe all other surfaces with a clean, damp cloth (make sure you dampen it with water-many spray cleaners, especially those with added fragrance, contain lung-irritating chemicals). And once a month, run your bedding-pillows, comforters, quilts-through a hot dryer cycle; the high temperature will kill any dust mites.</p><p><strong>The Pollutant: Shoe Debris</strong><br />When you stroll through your front door in your sneaks or stilettos, you're likely dragging in some gnarly muck. Sidewalks and lawns can be littered with lead dust, paint flecks, fertilizers, and animal waste-all of which sticks to your shoes. In fact, 80 percent of our exposure to pesticides happens indoors, thanks to tracked-in contaminants, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p><strong>The solution:</strong> Dislodge clods of dirt or grass by rubbing your shoes over a durable outdoor mat (bristly coconut-husk types work best). Once inside, leave your kicks on a cloth mat by the front door.</p><p><strong>The Pollutant: Furniture</strong><br />Pressed wood-also called particleboard or fiberboard-is actually little bits of wood held together by glues and resins. It's cheap (think: affordable bookcases and tables), but it may also emit formaldehyde, a preservative and suspected carcinogen that can trigger rashes, nausea, or <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/conditions/asthma"">asthma</a> attacks, according to the EPA.</p><p><strong>The solution:</strong> Ventilate, ventilate, ventilate. ""A cheap window-facing fan can clear a room's air in minutes,"" says May. Or consider opting for solid wood, especially for kitchen and bathroom items, since humidity amps up emissions. If you must go the pressed route, stick with plywood, which releases the fewest fumes.</p><p><strong>The Pollutant: Mold</strong><br />Believe it or not, a little bit of mold can be beneficial: Outdoors, it helps organic stuff decompose, says indoor-air scientist Connie Morbach. ""But when those mold spores are activated by indoor moisture, they can grow out of control,"" she explains. Excess fungus can induce unpleasant symptoms like itchy eyes and breathing problems. And a few harmful strains can attack your immune system.</p><p><strong>The solution:</strong> Indoor air that's 30 to 50 percent humidity is comfortable for you but discouraging to mold (buy a $30 digital hygrometer at a hardware store to check your room levels). Spores love dark, damp corners, so once a week mop around your fridge, sinks, and toilets with a mild dish detergent or diluted hydrogen peroxide. Just be sure to dry everything thoroughly; mold can sprout in just 48 hours.</p>",
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/psychology-of-sport,Life,8,20,3,2,0,0,0,0,,Peak Performance: Get Your Head in the Game,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1010-peak-performance-art.jpg,"<p>Golf, like all sports, is a head game-something that 32-year-old LPGA superstar Cristie Kerr is well aware of. ""I practice mental conditioning as much as I practice hitting chip shots,"" she says. To keep her nerves at bay and her mind focused, Cristie regularly works with noted sports psychologist Joseph Parent, Ph.D., author of the popular book <em>Zen Golf: Mastering the Mental Game</em>. Just as important as all the physical training is the training that nobody really sees-the kind that happens inside an athlete's mind, explains Parent.</p><p>Sports psychology, once written off as a New Agey field, has exploded in recent years-in fact, many of today's top athletes have a sports psychologist on their payroll. And while most of us will never land a back handspring, attempt a triple axel, or set a record in the giant slalom, we can still prevail on the playing fields that matter to us (the office, the gym, even the bedroom) by employing these simple strategies.</p><p><strong>Do a Mental Dress Rehearsal</strong><br />Ever notice how top athletes never seem to be overwhelmed by the big moment? Usually, it's because they've been there before-either in real life or in their mind. ""Studies show that the parts of the brain that are used when thinking about a task are the same ones used when actually doing it,"" says sports psychologist Shane Murphy, Ph.D., editor of <em>The Sport Psych Handbook</em>. So visualizing a good performance can give you the same confidence that comes from having performed well in the past. Got a presentation coming up at work? Have to give a toast at a friend's wedding? In the days leading up to the event, try this exercise: Close your eyes and imagine hitting all of your talking points and getting (intentional) laughs, and the audience rewarding you with a big round of applause at the end. When it's time for the real deal, you'll be more relaxed. In fact, you'll feel as if you've done it before. Because, in a way, you have.</p><p><strong>Know When to Let Go</strong><br />During training sessions, athletes are hyperaware of every move they make. But under the pressure of competition, overanalyzing what they're doing (say, a tennis swing or figure-skating jump) can lead to indecision and tightening up. The result? Costly mistakes. One way to calm an overactive mind is by using diversionary tactics, says Sian Beilock, Ph.D., a psychologist at the University of Chicago and author of <em>Choke: What the Secrets of the Brain Reveal About Getting It Right When You Have To</em>. For example, before making a free throw, some basketball players will distract themselves by concentrating on the logo written on the ball. And Beilock instructs golfers to count backward by threes-starting at 25-a few seconds before striking the ball on a crucial shot. When you're swallowed up by a wave of performance anxiety, try using the same technique.</p><p><strong>Find the Words</strong><br />Sports psychologists often tell their athletes to find a few words or phrases that can automatically bring their performance into focus. ""Key words help you get connected with the way you want to feel,"" says Wayne Halliwell, Ph.D., of the University of Montreal, who helped guide Canadian figure skater Joannie Rochette to a bronze medal at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics just days after her mother's sudden death. Stand tall was one of the phrases she kept in mind as she took the ice-a double reminder to watch her form and her mood. Ask yourself, What do I want to achieve? If you want to stay open-minded on a blind date, your key word might be open; if you're running a 5-K, it might be steady.</p><p><strong>Ignore the Haters</strong><br />Athletes are always trying to psych one another out, and sometimes your detractors can be just as intimidating and cutthroat. Letting negative thoughts sink in can rattle your nerves, so when rivals try to play mind games, Nicole Detling Miller, Ph.D., a professor at the University of Utah, tells her athletes to consider it a compliment. ""If they're targeting you, it's probably out of jealousy,"" she says. ""Own that. Tell yourself, If they're gunning for me, I must be doing something right!""</p>",

But then a job as a sales rep kept her on the road, which meant most of her meals came from drive-throughs. ""I ate out constantly and munched on whatever was served at business meetings,"" says Andrea, now 29. By the winter of 2006, at 5'4"" and 215 pounds, she was miserable with her weight-and her career.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Change</b><br /><br /><br />A few months later, Andrea quit her sales job and enrolled at Towson University in Baltimore to pursue a teaching degree. Moving gave her the perfect opportunity for a fresh start. ""My weight was out of control,"" she says. ""This was the excuse I needed to get back on track.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Lifestyle</b><br /><br /><br />Cutting carbs jump-started Andrea's weight loss. ""I literally dreamed about cake, but after a few weeks I stopped having cravings,"" she says. She lost 12 pounds in a month, then slowly added whole grains back into her <a href=""/nutrition/the-ultimate-nutrition-plan-0"">nutrition plan</a>. She also began eating breakfast daily (something she'd never done before). Too self-conscious to join a gym, Andrea used fitness DVDs and weights at home, and in March 2007, she signed up for a program that trains beginners to run a 5-K. When she completed the race that October, she was 65 pounds lighter and ""incredibly happy.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Reward</b><br /><br /><br />Andrea now has the energy to keep up with the third-graders she teaches...and enough left over to train for a half marathon. She also enjoys how having a trimmer figure means she can now swap outfits with her friends. ""I'm fitting into clothes I wore in college!"" she says.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Andrea's Tips:</b><br /><br /><br /><i>Run early.</i> ""I wake up at 5 a.m. to get exercise in. If you don't make it a priority, it won't happen."" </p><p><i>Don't stress about the scale.</i> ""I try on an old pair of jeans once in a while. If they fit, I'm doing OK!"" </p><p><i>Bring your pregame.</i> ""I'll have a healthy snack like peanut butter and jelly on whole-wheat bread before going to happy hour so that I won't overdo it.""<br /><br /></p>",Getting Started

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/emotional-abuse,Sex And Relationships,22,19,12,666,20,51,14,0,,Is Your Partner Emotionally Abusive?,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1003-woman-crying.jpg,"<p>Julia Morrison* was in her twenties when she met her boyfriend at a film festival. He had J. Crew-model looks and a sexy British accent, and he was a feminist/poet/vegetarian-everything she thought she wanted after her breakup with a stereotypical frat boy who exalted football and keg stands.</p><p>In reality, he was anything but an enlightened guy. During their two-year relationship, he regularly abused her. And here's the kicker: She didn't know he was doing it. Because no hitting was involved, she simply didn't have a name for the behavior that made her feel ""diseased"" in his presence: the subtle put-downs, the physical avoidance, the mocking.</p><p>Experts do, though. They call it emotional abuse, and it's as widespread in romantic relationships as it is misunderstood. In the simplest terms, emotional abuse is defined as behavior and language designed to degrade or humiliate someone by attacking their self-value or personality. While a normal couple may disagree about how to spend money, for example, an emotional abuser will make his partner feel as though she's too stupid to understand the intricacies of finances.</p><p></p><p></p><p>It can range from verbal abuse-yelling, blaming, shaming, and name-calling-to isolation, intimidation, and threats. It also commonly shows up as stonewalling and dismissing, behaviors that make victims feel alone and unimportant.</p><p>Although there are few firm statistics on emotional abuse's prevalence among couples, experts say as many as two-thirds experience it, one-third of them chronically. Its effects can be devastating: depression, anxiety, and destroyed self-esteem. ""It's very erosive,"" says Marti Loring, Ph.D., author of <em>Emotional Abuse</em>. ""Whether it's overt or covert, the abuse negates a woman's very being.""</p><p><strong>Corrosive Love</strong><br />Emotional abuse can be subtle. In Morrison's case, her live-in boyfriend would give her a wide berth in their Stanford, Connecticut, apartment. ""There would be times when he'd have to walk past me, but he would purposely move his body in such a way that he'd avoid any chance of making contact,"" says the now 39-year-old. ""It made me feel awful."" Sometimes when they were walking together on the sidewalk, he'd abruptly cross the street without her-and then call her crazy, needy, and too sensitive when she mentioned it.</p><p>Emotional abuse can be more aggressive too. Liz Costa, a 33-year-old from Boulder, Colorado, was married to a controlling, volatile man who was prone to lashing out verbally at the slightest provocation.</p><p>He wasn't like that when they first became friends. ""We could talk and share ideas,"" Costa says. Their connection felt deep, and in some ways, destined. ""Our families had been intertwined since before we were born,"" she says. ""It all seemed meant to be, and I rolled with it.""</p><p>Things changed once she became pregnant with their first child. Her husband started flying off the handle over the smallest things. But she kept thinking he'd be happier if he got the right job, if she tried a little harder, if she happened on some magic formula. She didn't like how she felt each day, but also didn't think he was abusive, because he never hit her during their 12-year marriage.</p><p>Still, she didn't feel anything close to safe. ""I had to be extremely careful how I talked about things with him or it would blow up into an argument quickly. I could be sharing something that happened at work, and somehow the conversation would trigger him and he'd get angry,"" Costa said. ""I was walking on eggshells all the time, not knowing what would detonate the blowups.""</p><p>Over time, this tiptoeing around can devastate a woman, making her anxious, fatigued, and depressed, experts say. What's more, she thinks it's all her fault, and the very thought of leaving the relationship can add a layer of guilt and shame to the pile of negative emotions. Loring says, ""Women will tell me, 'I would rather he hit me, because at least I can heal from the strike.' But the emotional abuse just rings out in their minds with cruelty.""</p><p><strong>The Escalating Problem</strong><br />It's hard to get a handle on how many women are victims of emotional abuse. (And it's worth pointing out that women can also be perpetrators. See ""Are You Abusive?"" on page 120.) It's included in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's statistics on intimate partner violence, which costs the U.S. almost $9.7 billion in medical care, mental health services, and lost productivity each year.</p><p>""Just about everyone knows someone who's experienced it,"" says Steven Stosny, Ph.D., author of <em>Love Without Hurt: Turn Your Resentful, Angry, or Emotionally Abusive Relationship into a Compassionate, Loving One</em>. Several studies have found that up to 35 percent of women have been in romantic relationships that were emotionally abusive, and that such abuse was the greatest risk factor for and predictor of physical abuse. One study also found that emotionally abusive partners were more likely to commit murder or murder-suicide, and their victims were more likely to be suicidal. </p><p>Worst of all, the feelings that can lead to emotional abuse are on the rise. As Stosny explains it, many people these days think they're entitled to feel happy, and when they don't, they believe their rights have been violated. This violation makes them angry and hostile. An emotionally abusive person, caught up in this cycle of resentment and powerlessness, feels like he's not being treated fairly or getting enough attention, support, and obedience. He then feels justified in punishing the person closest to him: his partner. </p><p><strong>Blindsided by Love</strong><br />When a woman finds herself involved in an emotionally abusive relationship, she is often as surprised as her friends and family are, says counselor Kelly McDaniel, author of <em>Ready to Heal</em>. ""I repeatedly hear women say, 'The relationship didn't start out that way' or 'Most of the time, things seemed really good,' "" she says. ""Repetitive emotional abuse has an almost numbing effect. It becomes normal.""</p><p>And it can happen quickly. Karla Hanauer of Atlanta was in an emotionally abusive relationship from ages 19 to 21. Her boyfriend was eight years older than she was, and within their first month of dating, he had talked her into sleeping with him even though she hadn't intended to have sex with anyone until marriage.</p><p>In retrospect, she thinks he was trying to claim her through sex. And once he did, he gave her a ring with his name on it. After that, he accused her of betrayal every time she spent time with anyone else, including her own mother, flying into rages when she talked with other men. Soon, ""normal"" for Hanauer meant isolation from friends and family, because this was easier than dealing with his harsh accusations. ""He did a masterful job of separating me from my own life,"" she says.</p><p>The whole thing shocks her in retrospect. ""I've always been a strong, tough, smart person, and one would think I'd have seen a mental case like this coming from a mile away,"" she says. ""I was the valedictorian of my high school class, and I was on the fast track at the university. I didn't drink or do drugs or any of those things you associate with falling in love with an emotionally abusive person.""</p><p>But after a while, she says, ""It was like I wasn't even me anymore.""</p><p>Women who are being emotionally abused often feel trapped, and they change how they behave, speak, dress, socialize, and even work in an effort to dodge the hurtful language and behavior. As a result, they gradually lose their identities.</p><p>Teresa Haward, 30, had a boyfriend who would accuse her of being promiscuous for having dated other men. He'd take food away from her and tell her he wanted her to be as skinny as his ex. He questioned her love constantly, and even called her ""that""-as in, ""My mother didn't raise me to be with 'that.' ""When any family members or friends called her, he said they were stealing time from him, even though he and Haward were living together</p><p>Ultimately, she quit her job as a reporter because he didn't want her to work (he thought her job took up too much of her time) and became even more trapped in his tempestuous cave. Her friends hated to see it happen and stopped coming around, as did her brothers, who lived nearby. And she was too embarrassed to tell her parents what had become of her.</p><p>""I went from being happy to being incredibly depressed,"" she says. ""I would wake up in the morning and just cry. I felt like I was such a failure and maybe everything he said to me was true. My self-esteem was the size of a pinhead.""</p><p><strong>Prince Harming: Early Warning Signs</strong><br />When women end up in an emotionally abusive relationship, it's often a reflection of what they learned about affection as kids. Our brains are wired for bonding, and if we grew up in a home with parents who were harsh, judgmental, and unkind, we may have learned to confuse love with pain, McDaniel says: ""We can end up duplicating this pain over and over again in our adult relationships.""</p><p>Liz Costa recognizes now how she fell into this trap. She had an abusive stepfather and wasn't allowed to say no when she was a child. From him and from her mother, she absorbed the notion that her job was to please a man, and he would take care of her in return. With emotionally abusive men, though, this is an impossible task.</p><p>It's important for women to recognize early warning signs of emotional abusers. Stosny has identified nine red flags:</p><p><strong>1 He's a blamer.</strong> A guy may blame someone for cutting him off on the road, or more insidiously, he can blame his ex-girlfriend for making his life tough. Early on, this deplorable blaming trait is hard to detect because it is often couched in a compliment (e.g., ""You're nothing like that bitch I used to date""). Says Stosny: ""The law of blame is that it goes to the closest person. You'll eventually be the object of it.""</p><p><strong>2 He's resentful.</strong> People like this aren't able to deal with the fact that life can sometimes be tough and unfair. They dwell on the injustice. Their resentment is a self-defense mechanism, masking a fear of inadequacy or failure. </p><p><strong>3 He has an entitlement complex. </strong>This is sometimes related to resentment: If life is so damn hard for him, then he's entitled to cut in line and break other rules. Let him get close and he'll feel entitled to abuse you if you don't let him have his way. </p><p><strong>4 He has a superiority complex. </strong>Emotionally abusive people aren't satisfied by feeling OK about themselves; they have to feel better than other people. This can play out as competitiveness or self-righteousness, and can be alluring at first because he might flatter you with the ways in which you, too, are superior. </p><p><strong>5 He's petty.</strong> If he's the sort of person who makes a mountain out of the proverbial molehill-let's say, when a waitress doesn't put enough ice in his soda-be warned.</p><p><strong>6 He's sarcastic.</strong> This sort of humor is designed to make someone feel bad. Eventually, you'll be the target. <br /><strong><br />7 He's deceitful. </strong>If he exaggerates or distorts his past, it's a bad sign. It's not unusual to put on a good face when you're trying to impress a potential mate. But lying shows that his self-respect-and his regard for you-is low.</p><p><strong>8 He's jealous.</strong> A dab of jealousy is fine, but any more can be toxic. Stosny calls jealousy ""the only naturally occurring emotion that can cause psychosis""-the inability to distinguish the real from the imagined. Most severe relationship violence has jealousy at its root.</p><p><strong>9 He's pushy.</strong> While this might be done under the guise of ""sweeping you off your feet,"" guys who push for too much too soon can be trouble. He should care more about your boundaries than his desires.</p><p><strong>Finding the Escape Hatch</strong><br />Breaking up with an emotionally abusive partner is no easy task. These relationships can be like a physical addiction; when romantic love mixes with fear, the result is powerful and dangerous, McDaniel says. Our bodies secrete chemicals when we have sex or engage in other physical contact, and some-such as the neurotransmitter dopamine-create pleasant sensations that we crave. We repeat the behavior that makes our dopamine levels spike, so women who associate love with fear can be vulnerable to choosing men who will hurt them.</p><p>Emotionally abused women also become used to the behavior, and even if they don't like it, they may not feel like they have the psychological or social resources to sever the toxic bonds. In trying to please abusive men, they've made so many adjustments and accommodations that no sense of self is left. This is how some abusive men manage to coerce their partners into credit-card theft and other crimes, Loring says: ""A woman can be so emotionally abused that she doesn't have the confidence to say 'Whoa.' ""</p><p>The shattered confidence can also make it difficult to leave, even if the woman is miserable. Julia Morrison's boyfriend ended the relationship by calling her at work and saying he was tired of her crying and complaining. She begged him not to leave, but deep down felt relieved, because she knew she didn't have the strength to leave him on her own.</p><p>Guilt can also make it harder to break things off. If a woman didn't see or ignored the early warning signs and instead formed a deep bond with her partner, she's going to feel guilt and shame about leaving, Stosny says. So the first step is to recognize the abuse and our own limits in stopping it.</p><p>In the two months before Costa finally got up the courage to leave her husband, she endured a storm of abuse, as though he could sense she was getting ready to escape. She wanted her husband to know she was leaving-she didn't want to be accused of kidnapping their kids-so one morning after she dropped them off at school, she started packing the car. He worked nights and was still in bed, but the noise woke him up and he tried to keep her from moving her stuff out. She called the police, who waited long enough for her to get her belongings. </p><p>It took Karla Hanauer the better part of a year to find her way out of her relationship. What made it harder was that her boyfriend threatened to kill himself every time she tried to break up with him, a threat she took seriously because his father had committed suicide. Finally, her best friend convinced her that she needed to call his bluff-or spend the rest of her life with him because he had scared her into staying. ""Telling him I was leaving despite his threat, and realizing he wasn't going to kill himself, was like breaking a curse,"" Hanauer says. ""That broke his hold over me.""</p><p>Teresa Haward, the reporter who quit her job to please her abusive boyfriend, spent more than two years with him before she got counseling from a local women's shelter and finally moved to another state. To keep herself safe, she lied and told him they could have a long-distance relationship, but she never saw or spoke to him again. ""It finally sunk in that I wasn't going to change him,"" she says.</p><p>The hope that their abusive partners will change is what keeps many women hanging on-but, Stosny says, it's often a futile dream. Individual therapy for abusers also tends not to help because therapists may identify with their patients and not be able to recognize the abuse. And couples therapy isn't the solution if one partner is abusive-it can actually make things worse.</p><p>When McDaniel sees one partner abuse the other in therapy, she stops working with the couple and focuses on the abuser until he recognizes the effect he's having and is willing to make amends. Often, the news that he's abusive comes as a shock. If a man was spoken to that way as a child and is used to it, it can be startling for him to hear he's being hurtful. </p><p>Women who are prone to choosing abusive partners need to address that as well.

After all, we're now a country of perpetual latecomers and, ironically, we have modern technology to thank. How so? Because we have multiple ways to send a ""Sorry-be there soon!"" message, a lot of the shame we used to feel over wasting someone's time has been removed.</p><p>Texting, in particular, offers a perfect way to broker a little leeway. You can relay whatever's holding you up (""Alarm snafu!"") without having to hear the annoyance in your pal's voice. And you can pre-apologize for keeping her waiting. ""You may have every intention of arriving on time,"" says William Powers, author of <i>Hamlet's BlackBerry: A Practical Philosophy for Building a Good Life in the Digital Age</i>, ""but the presence of a mobile in your purse makes you think it's not a big deal if you're late.""<br /><b><br />What's the Holdup?</b><br />The reasons we're late in the first place are as varied as our excuses-and many of those reasons operate just outside of our awareness. Dan Ariely, Ph.D., a professor of psychology and economics at Duke University who studies irrational behavior, says a major cause of lateness is believing that ""things will go smoother than they actually do throughout the course of a typical day."" More specifically, people fail to plan for the varying nature of the delays they'll encounter. While they know they should tack on a little additional time for <a target=""_blank"">traffic tie-ups</a> on the bridge or a lost set of keys, he says, they routinely ignore the fact that, on average, other stuff can-and usually does-go wrong: For example, you rip your skirt getting into the car, run inside the house to change, and accidentally let the dog out.</p><p>But less obvious things can also cause you to fall behind schedule. Let's say you're on your way to see a friend whose overbearing personality has always made you feel a bit uneasy. ""Those ambivalent feelings can actually make you later than you normally would be,"" notes Elizabeth Fitelson, M.D., director of the women's program in the department of psychiatry at Columbia University. Even though you may not be fully cognizant of these feelings, your reluctance ends up slowing you down. Suddenly, everything from finding a different shade of lipstick to checking that long list of e-mail messages seems more important than getting out the door at the time you know you should.</p><p><a target=""_blank"">Anxiety</a> is a similar emotional trigger, says Fitelson. Being nervous about something, like a big presentation at work, can cause ""errors in judgment,"" she explains. You're so emotionally keyed up about facing the big bosses that you accidentally go to the wrong conference room.</p><p>In the psychology of lateness, basic denial of how overbooked you are can also play a large role. ""In some ways,"" says Fitelson, ""my clients would rather deal with the stress of always running a few minutes late-even though that feels terrible-than have to deal with the fear that their lives are just too complicated to work properly."" Powers agrees, adding that, once again, our digital world has created a new wrinkle:</p><p>""We have too much to do, thanks to a digital culture that creates the illusion that we can <a target=""_blank"">get more done</a> in the same amount of time.""</p><p><b>Tardiness Loves Company</b><br />Even though lateness may start in our own heads, no one is late in a vacuum. The effects of delayed arrivals can multiply, especially in groups, because friends may influence one another's timekeeping. It's as if people have decided that ""the ideal time to arrive may be just one second before the last person arrives,"" theorizes Ariely. ""But this is actually a bad social game,"" he adds, ""because if everyone tries to do it, everyone will be late.""</p><p>If lateness is contagious, it's a pretty nasty virus to catch, with plenty of serious consequences. In the workplace, for instance, being late can gradually eat away at your credibility. ""If you're chronically late,"" cautions Neil Fiore, Ph.D., author of The Now Habit at Work, ""you damage your reputation and may be considered unreliable, if not a flake."" Tardiness might not get you fired, but it isn't exactly helping you nab a bonus either.</p><p>And being behind schedule, especially if it's habitual, can also erode friendships. A friend's consistent tardiness, explains Fitelson, can ""convey disrespect and selfishness.""</p><p>Put it this way: You may feel as if you're late because you're a slave to a punishing schedule and trying to meet everyone else's needs. But your friends may harbor suspicions that you believe your time is more valuable than theirs. And, notes Fiore, ""There is no amount of texting that can repair that kind of damage.""<br /></p>",

We consulted studies published in the <i>Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research</i> in the past 12 months to find the smartest strategies for sending your performance soaring. Pick your distance and follow our advice-we guarantee you'll leave your former self, and a pack of others, in the dust.<br /><br /><b>Your race 5-K</b><br /><br /><b><b>Game</b> plan:</b> Gun it <br />Run your first mile of the race at least 6 percent faster than your typical pace. In a study of collegiate distance runners, those who jacked up their pace for the first mile finished 32 seconds faster than when they started at their average mile pace.<br /><br /><b>Do this:</b> Determine your max heart rate (220 minus your age), then figure out 65 to 75 percent of that. That's what your heart rate should be at your average pace. Add 6 percent (or more) to that pace time and you've got your first-mile pace.<br /><br /><b>Your race 10-K </b><br /><br /><b>Game plan:</b> Plyometrics<br />If you've always been partial to 5-K's but want to step up your training to rock a 10-K, add a bit of jumping to your weekly workouts. This can increase your running efficiency (how quickly oxygen flows to your muscles) by nearly 5 percent, making the extra miles a cinch.<br /><br /><b>Do this:</b> Split-Squat Jump. Start in a lunge position and jump up and forward, pushing off your front leg. Land in a lunge and repeat continuously for 10 yards. Rest 45 seconds. Do 3 reps and work up to 6. Complete the drill 3 nonconsecutive days a week.<br /><br /><b>Your race half-marathon or longer</b><br /><br /><b>Game plan:</b> Sprint uphill and downhill <br />Running hills preps you for the inevitable slopes you'll encounter over 13.1 miles, and the downhill portions teach your brain to execute a faster stride rate-how frequently your feet hit the ground. In a 2006 study, runners who trained this way improved their speed on flat terrain by up to 3.5 percent.<br /><br /><b>Do this:</b> Find a gentle slope (equivalent to a 3-degree incline on the treadmill) that's about 20 yards from top to bottom. Sprint up, then down. Rest 30 seconds. Repeat 8 to 12 times, 3 nonconsecutive days a week.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/paula-patton,Life,96,19,28,0,1,13,0,0,,Paula Patton's Precious Moments,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1003-paula-patton.jpg,"<p>As surprises go, this one was pretty sweet. Midway through her <em>Women's Health</em> photo shoot at a New York City studio, actress Paula Patton is interrupted by the unexpected delivery of an enormous arrangement of roses and lilies from a not-so-secret admirer: her husband, R&B singer Robin Thicke, 32. ""He's so good about sending flowers,"" she says with a smile. ""He does it consistently.""</p><p>Yes, it's nice to be Paula these days. Not only is the 34-year-old enjoying major accolades for her role as Ms. Rain, the heroic teacher in the emotionally powerful film <em>Precious: Based on the Novel ""Push"" by Sapphire</em>, but she and Robin are also expecting their first baby (they got the happy news not long before the aforementioned photo shoot; she's due this spring). The actress curls up on a leather sofa in the studio and talks animatedly about becoming a mom. ""You can get into that cycle of 'What's next? What's next?' "" she says. ""But I thought, I want to have children, and I'm not getting any younger. But I didn't know if it would be hard for me to get pregnant."" Not to worry. Shortly after going off birth control, Paula was with child, prompting Robin to brag about his supersperm. ""He's so proud of himself, it's ridiculous,"" says Paula with a laugh.</p><p><strong>Playing the Part</strong></p><p>The charmed life Paula is now living is a far cry from the grittiness portrayed in <em>Precious</em>, Lee Daniels's film about the salvation of a poor, illiterate teenage victim of abuse and incest. To prepare for the role, Paula spent weeks shadowing a teacher at a New York City alternative school. On set, she tried to stay in character by keeping a distance from the actresses who play her students, including the movie's star, Gabourey Sidibe. That didn't last long. ""The way she walked and talked, I thought she was [as sad as] Precious,"" Paula recalls. Within a week, though, she discovered the real ""Gabby""-friendly and upbeat. ""In the makeup trailer, she'd say, 'Did you guys see The Hills this weekend?' I was like, Who are you?""</p><p>Paula knows what it's like to be misunderstood. Growing up in L.A., the daughter of a white teacher and an African-American defense attorney, it wasn't easy to fit in. ""People judged me because I was light-skinned. [They'd assume] I didn't want to be part of the black race,"" she says. In fact, Paula, who has been referred to as biracial, says it's a word she doesn't care for. ""I find it offensive. It's a way for people to separate themselves from African-Americans...a way of saying 'I'm better than that.' I'm black because that's the way the world sees me. People aren't calling Barack Obama biracial. Most people think there's a black president.""</p><p><strong>A Change in Plans</strong></p><p>After graduating from high school, Paula headed off to the University of California at Berkeley for a semester, then studied at the University of Southern California's film school. Eventually, she found work as a producer for the Discovery Health Channel's <em>Medical Diaries</em>, but she ditched the documentaries to try her hand at screenplay writing. It wasn't the right fit.""I didn't have the passion,"" she says.</p><p>What she did have was an epiphany. ""I'd loved to act since I was little,"" she says. ""So I thought, Screw it! I have nothing to lose."" About a year later, she landed a part in Will Smith's 2005 film <em>Hitch</em>, then in 2006 starred with Denzel Washington in <em>Deja Vu</em>. (Her next movie is <em>Just Wright</em>, with Common and Queen Latifah, due out this year.) Given how gorgeous she is, it's no shocker she wound up in front of the camera. Still, Paula insists she hasn't always felt confident about her looks. ""Just like in <em>Precious</em>,"" she says, ""we all have that feeling of looking into the mirror and not liking what we see.""</p><p><strong>Through Thicke and Thin</strong></p><p>If she ever doubted her beauty, someone else has always been convinced of it: Robin. The two started dating when she was 19 and he was 18. Fifteen years later (they've been married for almost five), the couple is still going strong. ""He makes me feel beautiful,"" Paula says. ""That's the best thing about having a partner-there is someone to tell you, 'Stop it. You look great!' Of course, he can't say anything else-he's been trained.""</p><p>His support came in handy during a rough patch about two years ago. Between movies, Paula returned to her L.A. home ""feeling lonely and just trying to figure out who I was."" Making matters worse, she committed the cardinal Hollywood sin of-gasp!-gaining a few pounds. Shortly after, the couple attended a party and Paula wore ""this baby-doll dress that made me look pregnant."" The result: tabloid pregnancy rumors, which hurt. ""That's when you realize you do care what people think.""</p><p>Over time, Paula has grown more comfortable with seeing herself the way Robin does-enough to agree to grace the back cover of this issue, which contains a beauty bonus section. ""The older I get, the more I accept and appreciate myself,"" she says. ""I know if I enrich my mind and spirit, then I'll feel good. And when you feel good about yourself, it can't help but reflect on your outer beauty.""</p><p><strong>Paula's Feel-Good Guide</strong><br /></p><p>How she stays healthy, happy, and stress-free</p><p><strong>1. Breathe Deep</strong></p><p>""A year ago, I started doing Ashtanga yoga five or six days a week. Even if I do 30 minutes, I can clear my head. I've cut back during my pregnancy. I told my trainer I don't want to see the inside of a gym. She said, 'Don't worry. I'll have you back [in shape] in six weeks.' ""</p><p><strong>2. Go Green</strong></p><p>""I'm trying to eat smart because I don't want [losing the] postpregnancy weight to be difficult. There's this packet of nutrients called Green Vibrance, and I at least try to have that. I also try to eat a salad every day. I switched from drinking coffee to green tea, but I've been craving milk shakes. My trick for not giving in: Fill up with some fruit or water first, then see if I still want one.""</p><p><strong>3. Feed Your Face</strong></p><p>""Since I've been pregnant, my nails have been stronger and my hair is thicker. My skin has been dry though, so I use a lot of La Mer products. I've also been doing Intraceuticals oxygen facials and Shiseido eye masks. I'll pop them on and look fresher. I'm also loving my Clarisonic facial wash brush. It's my new toy.""<br /><strong></strong></p><strong></strong><p><strong>4. Get Some Shut-Eye</strong></p><p>""When people say 'You have a pregnancy glow!' I wonder if it has to do with my healthier lifestyle. No more cocktails, and I'm getting more sleep than ever-nine or 10 hours a night. I was never that girl!""</p><p><b>Check out our behind-the-scenes video of Paula from the March cover shoot:</b> </p><p></p><p></p>",Be In The Know

As you <a target=""_blank"" href=""/fitness/running"">run, breathe</a> in for one step and out for two. <br /><b>Why?</b> ""The rapid inhale and slower exhale in this technique fills your lungs from the bottom,"" Dreyer says.

Given that I can't even handle sitting next to strangers on planes, I'm about as likely to become one with the universe as Carmen Electra is to win an Oscar. I do it because meditation gives me confidence at the top of a double-black-diamond run, presence of mind when I have to give a toast at a wedding, and perspective when I'm brawling with my boyfriend. At the end of a rough day, meditation takes the edge off faster than a pomegranate martini. Yeah, it's that good.<br /><br /><b>Proof</b><br />But when I suggest to my equally <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/tips-to-stress-less"">stressed-out</a> friends that they try meditating, they look at me like I have six heads. They think meditation is for Buddhist monks or people who grow pot in their basements. They assume it's too out there to have any real, positive effects. Which is why no one is more thrilled than I that recent scientific research is producing cold, hard evidence that meditation can reduce stress, promote healing, increase immunity, and even make you smarter. While I can't deny that my first reaction was a powerful urge to say ""I told you so,"" after meditating on it I decided to get the word out because I genuinely hope that more people will learn the practice and start feeling a whole lot better.<br /><br /><b>Seriously, It's That Easy</b><br />If you're not exactly sure what meditation is, let me explain: You sit comfortably, close your eyes, and pay attention to your <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/breathing-during-exercise"">breathing</a>. Feel the air as it rushes in through your nose and fills up your lungs from top to bottom, then empties back out again. Repeat. You'll naturally start to breathe more slowly and deeply. Notice what pops into your head - like what you want for dinner, whether Benicio is sexier than Brad, if you should ask for a raise...No matter what it is, label it as a ""thought,"" then redirect your attention to your breath. When you catch yourself daydreaming, planning, analyzing, or worrying (which will happen constantly), just let the thoughts drift by and refocus on the air flowing through your body. Stick to it for 10 to 15 minutes and you're done.<br /><br />Among the latest and most mind-blowing research on meditation is the discovery that it affects your brain the way exercise affects your body - making it stronger, healthier, and more efficient. Richard J. Davidson, Ph.D., a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, has found that experienced meditators produce more gamma brain waves. Gamma waves are associated with intense, clear thinking and heightened cooperation between various parts of the brain - if brain waves were gas, gammas would be the ultra-premium stuff. And high gamma-wave levels weren't limited to the time spent meditating, indicating that the subjects' brains had become conditioned to work better around the clock.<br /><br /> <b>The Bennies Add Up</b><br />What's more, there's reason to believe that meditation prevents or even reverses the effects of aging on the brain. Sara Lazar, Ph.D., a psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital, put 20 subjects who had meditated for an average of 40 minutes a day for 9 years through an MRI. She found that their prefrontal cortexes - the part of the brain responsible for attention and sensory perception - weren't showing typical age-related thinning. ""Just as the area of the brain associated with motor skills is thicker in athletes, the area of the brain associated with attention and sensory perception is thicker in meditators,"" she says. That means that if you start now, you won't have trouble beating your grandson at virtual poker when you're 90. (And if your mother, like mine, is one of those scatterbrained types who calls her kids by the cat's name and votes for the wrong contestant on <i>American Idol</i> because she can't get the numbers straight, you might want to pop a meditation CD in the mail to her before things get any worse.)<br /><br />As for more short-term effects, 40 minutes of meditation might do more for your ability to stay alert than a 40-minute nap. In a study at the University of Kentucky, Bruce O'Hara, Ph.D., had volunteers push a button as soon as they saw images pop up on an LCD screen.<br /><br />Dr. O'Hara tested people before and after 40 minutes of sleeping, reading, conversing, or meditating. To his surprise he discovered that meditation was the only activity that led to an immediate improvement in performance (sleep helps too, but it takes an hour to get over grogginess). Then he conducted the test again after forcing volunteers to pull an all-nighter. Meditation improved results even more than it had in the earlier test - and was still better than sleep. New studies are under way to determine why. In the meantime, if you've been up until the wee hours boozing, breastfeeding, or putting a little spice back into your relationship, consider meditating before heading to work.<br /><br />And let's not forget meditation's most famous effect: relaxation. There's no question that meditation has made me less of a stressball and eased some of my stress-related health issues. Back when I'd have fights that went on for days and lie awake worrying about looming deadlines, I suffered from far more migraines, hives, and - when things got really bad - this weird twitch in my left eyelid. Dr. Davidson, the neurologist who led the gamma-wave study, administered blood tests to long-term meditators and found that they have less of the stress hormone cortisol at the end of the day compared with nonmeditators. Not all that surprising, since the slow, deep breathing of meditation is known to bring on a state of calm by turning off our fight-or-flight response and letting our bodies know it's safe to relax.<br /><br />Alas, those long-term meditators had been at it for 15 to 40 years - that's a lot of meditating. But an earlier study showed reduced anxiety and stronger immune function after just 2 months of meditating for about 30 minutes a day at home, plus a once-a-week meditation class. Some novices produced as many as 25 percent more antibodies in response to a flu vaccine. Being one-fourth less likely to catch that virus that's going around is nothing to sniff at.<br /><br />Besides the flu, meditation can help alleviate another potential epidemic - depression. Zindel Segal, Ph.D., of the Center for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, has found that depressed patients who are treated with both cognitive therapy and meditation are 50 percent less likely to relapse than patients who don't add meditation to the mix. Meditation derails negative thinking patterns, Dr. Segal explains: ""Thinking the same thought over and over cuts a track in your mind, making it easier to think the same way in the future."" In other words, if someone is prone to self-critical and/or self - defeating thoughts, her neurons get used to firing along those pathways, and those thoughts become a habit that gets harder and harder to break. ""Meditation provides a technique for retraining our reactions to certain situations,"" Dr. Segal says. ""It gives us a way to change.""<br /><br />Once you start using meditation to deal with stress, you're more likely to be able to stop doing other things that may not be so good for you - like eating a bag of chips, taking your bad mood out on your significant other, or having one too many of those pomegranate martinis. Although I confess, I still do all of the above once in a while. And, frankly, that's fine with me. Like I said, I'm not planning to reach a state of complete inner peace anytime soon. But one less temper flare, one more good night of sleep, one less headache, one more great meeting...That definitely makes a few minutes of meditation every day well worth the trouble.</p>","de-stress,depression,meditation,Basics,Calm"
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/sex-dream-meaning,Sex And Relationships,25,19,0,4,3,0,1,0,,Your Sex Dreams Decoded,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1101-dreams.jpg,"<p>Elena, a single 32-year-old, recently woke up flushed and sweaty from a sex dream during which she had an intense orgasm. She was pleasantly surprised at first, but then details started flooding back. ""It was with my best friend,"" she admits. ""My best <i>girl</i> friend."" The dream left her feeling embarrassed and disturbed, wondering what the heck it all meant.<br /><br /><br /><br />That's the tricky part about getting down and dirty in your dreams: While you may love the steamy sex scenes and, in some cases, the sheet-twisting sensations those visions can provide, you may also wake up feeling confused, guilty, or totally creeped out. Do these unconscious fantasies mean you're secretly attracted to your best friend? That you still harbor feelings for your ex? Or that you're yearning to hook up with a hot stranger?<br /><br /><br /><br />Highly charged nocturnal sessions happen because of normal physiological changes: During the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep cycle, your central nervous system fires up and your body goes through the same physical reactions that occur when you're turned on in real life. ""In REM, breathing and blood flow naturally increase, including blood flow to the genitals,"" says dream researcher Kelly Bulkeley, Ph.D., a visiting scholar at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. ""So it's not surprising that these physiological changes often express themselves as an erotic dream."" Your menstrual cycle can also influence the likelihood of having an unconscious frisky frolic: A <i>Journal of Sex Research</i> study found that women have more sex dreams during ovulation, probably because their libidos are higher then (driven by the biological urge to procreate).<br /><br /><br /><br />Antonio Zadra, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at the Université de Montréal, analyzed more than 3,500 dreams and discovered that at least 8 percent of them contained some sort of sexual activity. His findings suggest that erotic dreams may have a straightforward psychological explanation: They simply reflect what we're thinking about when we're awake. So if you dream about sex at night, it's because it was on your mind during the day. And if you have ever woken up thinking you've had a legitimate orgasm while asleep, you might have-4 percent of our dreams actually result in one. (Interestingly, men's dreams are more selfish; they rarely dream about their partners' orgasms, whereas women often do.)<br /><br /><br /><br />However, not all sex dreams are actually about sex, says Bulkeley. Sometimes they're a symbol for emotions, such as being pissed off at your guy. ""Dreams can use the drama of a sexual relationship to express emotional truths and reveal conflicts,"" he says. ""I once spoke with a woman who wanted to become a writer, but her husband was totally opposed to the idea. One night she dreamed that she was having an affair with a male writer. The dream had nothing to do with sex-her goals were causing conflict in her relationship."" That said, he adds, ""the worst thing to do is to treat a dream like it's a Magic 8 Ball."" (In other words, if you dream that you or your partner cheated, for example, it isn't necessarily a red flag that your relationship is in hot water.) Instead, think of your dreams as cues to do some exploring about yourself or your relationship.<br /><br /></p><p>Want a little help? We got top experts to decipher three common erotic dream themes.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>His Cheating Heart</b><br /><br /><br />Unfaithfulness is the most common dream scenario for couples, says Bulkeley, and that's no surprise: Getting close to someone means being vulnerable. Dreams that include threats, like your man fooling around, are like fire drills, he says. ""Your dreaming mind might imagine the worst-case scenario-cheating-to prepare yourself for if it happened,"" says Bulkeley.<br /><br /><br /><br />These dreams may reflect your lack of confidence and trust, notes Drew Ramsey, M.D., an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University. Or, having a dream about a partner's infidelity can mean you feel like you're not getting his attention, says Gillian Holloway, Ph.D., author of <i>The Complete Dream Book of Love and Relationships</i>. If so, talk with your guy about how you two can stay more connected. If you're having dream flings, this can also signal you're not getting what you need from your partner, according to psychologist and dream analysis expert Michael Lennox. And that's another reason to have a talk.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Blast from the Past</b><br /><br /><br />It's not unusual for exes to creep into sex dreams, but having an erotic dream starring an old crush usually doesn't mean you still harbor feelings. More likely, it's your brain reusing a familiar face from your past. ""Research shows that there's a repetition dimension to dreaming, which is why we still have anxiety dreams about not studying for a college exam years after leaving school,"" says Bulkeley. ""Our past experiences shape who we are today, and though the man in the dream may not be in your life anymore, he's still a part of who you are.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Exes who appear in dreams often symbolize your current partner, if you have one, says Holloway. ""Making out with an ex might mean you want your current partner to find you desirable too,"" she says.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Taboo Sex</b><br /><br /><br />Whether it's a passionate romp with a stranger, sex with another woman, or a porn-worthy orgy, Bulkeley says these dream scenes may reflect your inner desires, albeit in some cases an extreme version of a lusty longing. There's a male/female divide on this type of dream: In Zadra's research, men were twice as likely as women to dream about multiple partners, while the female unconscious favored getting busy with a celeb.<br /><br /><br /><br />Either way, there's no holding back racy thoughts in dreams. That's because they're judgment-free zones in which our subconscious can let loose and we can live out a fantasy, even if we'd never act on it in real life. So lie back and enjoy.<br /><br /></p><p><b>Crack the Dream Code</b><br /><br /><br />While the meanings behind common symbols are subjective, here's a look at what they can signify:<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Kissing:</i> A passionate liplock can be a symbol of approval and acceptance.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Nakedness:</i> Nudity often represents being vulnerable and may symbolize exposing parts of yourself that you would rather keep hidden.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Love:</i> Not surprisingly, it's all about romance. If you're attached, a dream of real love means you're happy with the relationship. If you're single, it means you're open to finding love.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Attraction:</i> Finding someone attractive can mean you're craving the feeling or experience that person represents to you, according to some dream dictionaries.<br /><br /></p>",healthy eating

But if you don't watch your mouth while you're working the party circuit, you could easily consume an extra 250 calories a day - enough to add 5 pounds to your booty just in time for your New Year's resolutions. Instead of banning your favorite holiday goodies, just ID the diet-friendliest fare with our handy guide to avoid <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/how-to-get-into-the-best-shape-1"">holiday weight gain</a>. And keep your weight-loss efforts from disappearing down a ho-ho-hole.<br /><br /><br /><b><a></a><u>Cocktails</u></b><br /><br /><b>Drink This: Chocolate Martini</b><br />Per 2-ounce serving: 167 calories, 1 g fat (1 g saturated), 0 mg sodium, 8 g carbohydrates, 0 g fiber, 0 g protein<br /><br /><b>Not That: White Russian</b><br />Per 6-ounce serving: 374 calories, 16 g fat (10 g saturated), 35 mg sodium, 12 g carbohydrates, 0 g fiber, 2 g protein<br /><br />Topped with melt-in-your-mouth chocolate shavings, the martini may seem more indulgent, but it's positively skinny compared with its Russian cousin. Yes, both drinks are made with vodka and sugary liqueur, but the Russki weighs in with 3 times the calories and 10 times the saturated fat, thanks to a hefty dose of light cream - typically about 1/3 cup.<br /><br /><b>Drink This: Cosmopolitan</b><br />Per 2-ounce serving: 124 calories, 0 g fat, 2 mg sodium, 9 g carbohydrates, 0 g fiber, 0 g protein<br /><br /><b>Not That: Manhattan</b><br />Per 3.5-ounce serving: 213 calories, 0 g fat, 3 mg sodium, 7 g carbohydrates, 0 g fiber, 0 g protein<br /><br />Both of these libations sound sexy in a metropolitan kind of way, but nutritionally speaking, the cosmo kicks the Manhattan's butt: It has half the alcohol and therefore far fewer calories (a Manhattan is usually made with 2 1/2 ounces of bourbon). Plus, the lime and cranberry juices in the Carrie Bradshaw fave give it an edge in the antioxidant department. That sugar-soaked maraschino cherry in the Manhattan does not make it a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/healthy-cocktails"">healthy alcoholic drink.</a><br /><br /><b>Drink This: Hot Chocolate with Marshmallows</b><br />Per 1-cup serving (with 2 tablespoons mini marshmallows): 212 calories, 6 g fat (4 g saturated), 115 mg sodium, 32 g carbohydrates, 0 g fiber, 9 g protein<br /><br /><b>Not That: Eggnog (the nonalcoholic kind)</b> <br />Per 1-cup serving: 343 calories, 19 g fat (11 g saturated), 137 mg sodium, 34 g carbohydrates, 0 g fiber, 10 g protein<br /><br />Craving something sweet and warm? Go with the cocoa - it has only 1 teaspoon of sugar to the eggnog's 5, plus more antioxidants per cup than red wine or tea (drinks commonly lauded for their high antioxidant content). The nog, on the other hand - which contains milk, cream, and beaten eggs - is chock-full of artery-clogging saturated fat and has seven times more cholesterol than the hot chocolate. If you simply can't get into the holiday spirit without eggnog, buy the kind made with 2 percent milk: You'll save 152 calories and 11 grams of fat. <br /><br /><b>Drink This: Mimosa</b><br />Per 6-ounce serving: 156 calories, 0 g fat, 1 mg sodium, 8 g carbohydrates, 0 g fiber, 0 g protein<br /><br /><b>Not That: Kir Royale</b><br />Per 6.5-ounce serving: 219 calories, 0 g fat, 0 mg sodium, 7 g carbohydrates, 0 g fiber, 0 g protein<br /><br />You can't have a holiday brunch without a little bubbly. But go for the mimosa - with about 1/4 cup of orange juice, it packs half the recommended daily allowance of vitamin C (about 30 milligrams). It's also less likely to give you a hangover by noon than the kir cocktail, which contains only alcoholic ingredients (champagne and black currant liqueur).<br /><br />Keep your cosmos cold and your cocoa hot. The drinks above are served in Bodum's double-wall collection, which just expanded to include barware. Canteen collection: $12 to $40 for a set of two; Manhattan Bar collection: $10 to $25 each, bodumusa.com.<br /><br /><b>Make It<br />Chocolate Martini</b><br />Combine 1 1/2 ounces chilled vodka, 1/2 ounce chocolate liqueur, and ice cubes in a cocktail shaker. Shake or stir to mix. Strain into a martini glass and grate some dark chocolate over the top. For a more intense chocolate flavor - and just 20 extra calories (187 total) - use equal amounts of vodka (1 ounce) and liqueur (1 ounce).<br /><br /><b><a></a><u>Party Food </u></b><br /><br /><b>Eat This: Bacon-Wrapped Fig</b><br />Per 2-ounce serving: 81 calories, 4 g fat (1 g saturated), 178 mg sodium, 10 g carbohydrates, 1 g fiber, 3 g protein<br /><br /><b>Not That: Potato Pancake Topped with Sour Cream and Applesauce</b> <br />Per 2-ounce serving: 131 calories, 7 g fat (2 g saturated), 197 mg sodium, 14 g carbohydrates, 1 g fiber, 3 g protein<br /><br />Sure, it starts out as a veggie. But once the potato is pummeled into a pancake, fried, and adorned with sweet and sour toppings, its health-food status goes out the window. Not so the fig: With plenty of potassium, calcium, and iron, it's the clear winner - even snuggled in a skinny strip of pork.<br /><br /><b>Eat This: Mini Quiche Lorraine</b><br />Per 1-ounce serving: 110 calories, 7 g fat (3 g saturated), 114 mg sodium, 9 g carbohydrates, 0 g fiber, 3 g protein<br /><br /><b>Not That: Brie Cheese Puff</b><br />Per 1.5-ounce serving: 209 calories, 16 g fat (6 g saturated), 230 mg sodium, 9 g carbohydrates, 0 g fiber, 7 g protein<br /><br />Any app made of dough signals a diet danger zone. And it's true that both these finger foods are rich. But the buttery puff pastry surrounding the Brie takes the cake when it comes to fat, calories, and sodium. Indulge at your own risk. <br /><br /><b>Eat This: Salmon with Sour Cream and Caviar on a Cracker</b><br />Per 1.5-ounce serving: 93 calories, 5 g fat (2 g saturated), 64 mg sodium, 4 g carbohydrates, 0 g fiber, 7 g protein<br /><br /><b>Not That: Goose Liver Pat on Crostini</b><br />Per 1.5-ounce serving: 181 calories, 13 g fat (4 g saturated), 266 mg sodium, 12 g carbohydrates, 1 g fiber, 4 g protein<br /><br />Load up a cracker with 1 ounce of salmon (the richest fish around), sour cream, and caviar and it's still leaner than an equal amount of pat by a mile. Also, the salmon has a hearty amount of omega-3 fatty acids, which help prevent heart disease.<br /><br /><b>Eat This: Roasted Chestnuts</b> <br />Per 1-ounce serving, shelled: 88 calories, 1 g fat (<1 g saturated), 1 mg sodium, 19 g carbohydrates, 2 g fiber, 1 g protein<br /><br /><b>Not That: Roasted Salted Pistachios</b><br />Per 1-ounce serving, shelled: 161 calories, 13 g fat (2 g saturated), 115 mg sodium, 8 g carbohydrates, 3 g fiber, 6 g protein<br /><br />Once the shells come off, there's no contest - it's a clear knockout by the chestnuts, which are deliciously nutty without being fatty. They're also a good source of vitamin C. <br /><br /><b>Eat This: Honey-Baked Ham</b> <br />Per 3-ounce serving: 125 calories, 5 g fat (2 g saturated), 1,020 mg sodium, 2 g carbohydrates, 0 g fiber, 18 g protein <br /><br /><b>Not That: Dark-Meat Turkey</b><br />Per 3-ounce serving: 188 calories, 10 g fat (3 g saturated), 65 mg sodium, 0 g carbohydrates, 0 g fiber, 23 g protein<br /><br />You'd think the sweet pig would be the big loser in this pair, but it actually has less than a teaspoon of sugar. Prefer the bird? Remove the skin: You'll save almost 30 calories and 4 grams of fat. Better yet, go for white meat, which is leaner.<br /><br /><b>Eat This: French Onion Dip</b><br />Per 2 tablespoons: 93 calories, 9 g fat (3 g saturated), 201 mg sodium, 2 g carbohydrates, 0 g fiber, 1 g protein<br /><br /><b>Not That: Dill Dip</b><br />Per 2 tablespoons: 132 calories, 14 g fat (3 g saturated), 194 mg sodium, 1 g carbohydrates, 0 g fiber, 1 g protein<br /><br />Two of the most popular dips to grace holiday buffets, neither is a nutritional powerhouse - they're made of basically the same stuff. But the French onion wins, thanks to its creamy-ingredient ratio: It's about three parts sour cream and one part mayo. The dill? Fifty percent mayo. Imagine how much you're getting if you double dip!<br /><br /><b>Eat This: Fruitcake</b><br />Per 4-by-3-inch slice: 139 calories, 4 g fat (<1 g saturated), 116 mg sodium, 26 g carbohydrates, 2 g fiber, 1 g protein<br /><br /><b>Not That: Gingerbread</b><br />Per 2 3/4-inch square: 263 calories, 12 g fat (3 g saturated), 242 mg sodium, 36 g carbohydrates, 1 g fiber, 3 g protein<br /><br />Family recipes vary, of course - but when you compare equal amounts of these sweets, the fruitcake is almost always skinnier. Why? The raisins and candied fruits take up so much space that there's not much room for the more fattening cake batter. Plus, they add antioxidants and tummy-filling fiber.<br /><br /><b>Eat This: Fudge</b> <br />Per 2-inch square: 233 calories, 6 g fat (3 g saturated), 27 mg sodium, 43 g carbohydrates, 1 g fiber, 1 g protein<br /><br /><b>Not That: Toffee</b><br />Per 2-inch square: 293 calories, 20 g fat (12 g saturated), 162 mg sodium, 28 g carbohydrates, 1 g fiber, 2 g protein<br /><br />Okay, the toffee has some healthy fat, thanks to the nuts. But most of it is more saturated than Prince William Sound after Exxon Valdez. The fudge is not only lighter, it's also rich in flavanols - compounds that protect your blood vessels.<br /><br />Luminarc Onyx & Ice plates: $18 for four, select Target stores, 800-800-8800.<br /><br /><b>Make It<br />French Onion Dip</b><br />In a medium bowl, stir together 1 1/4 cup fat-free sour cream, 1/2 cup fat-free mayonnaise, 1/8 cup chopped scallions, 1 (1-ounce) package dry onion soup mix, 1/4 teaspoon dried minced onion, and salt and pepper to taste.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/glee-lea-michele,Life,39,19,16,1,0,0,0,0,,Living the Dream with Lea Michele,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1006-lea-michele.jpg,"<p>It's just after 9 a.m. on a gray and rainy Saturday the kind of morning that has even the most energetic Los Angelenos hitting the snooze button and crawling back under their comforters. Lea Michele, however, is hard at work.</p><p>Strapped into a safety harness, the 5'3"" actress-who's dressed in black knee-length workout pants and a matching zip-up top, her long, dark hair pulled back into a tight ponytail-is attempting to scale a 24-foot climbing wall at Rockreation, an indoor wonderland of sculpted vertical terrain. It's a tough ascent, but Lea summits with ease, pulling herself up peg by peg and giving those biceps and hamstrings a wicked workout. ""That was fun,"" she says enthusiastically, touching down onto solid ground. ""Now let's try a harder one!""</p><p>Clearly, Lea likes the view from the top. And as one of the stars of Fox's hit show <em>Glee</em>-a musical dramedy about a high school singing club made up of loveable, music-obsessed misfits-the 23-year-old who grew up in Manhattan and Tenafly, New Jersey, has gotten used to breathing in rarified air. Put it this way: If Hollywood were high school, the crazy talented cast would be holding court at the cool lunch table, with Lea, who plays Rachel Berry-the self-appointed leader of the pack-sitting front and center.<br /><br /><br /><br />The show is a critics' darling (it picked up hardware at this year's People's Choice Awards, Screen Actors Guild Awards, and Golden Globe Awards) and has developed a cult following (fans are affectionately known as Gleeks). This past April, the cast performed at the White House Easter Egg Roll, and even appeared on Oprah's show. And then there was this A-list encounter: ""I went out to dinner with my boyfriend, and Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem were leaving the restaurant as we were going in,"" recalls Lea. ""[Penelope] was like, 'Eez eet you? Are you dee girl I've been zeeing at all of deez [award] tings?'""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Don't Stop Believing</b><br /><br /><br /><br />Indeed, the past few months have been a whirlwind-and they've left Lea feeling a little fried. ""I need some me-time,"" she admits. ""I have to remember to rest, because I have a natural energy and I don't want to burn out.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Not much chance of that. Fact is, like her <i>Glee</i> character, Lea has always been a nonstop go-getter. She broke into acting when, as a precocious 8-year-old, she asked her parents if she could go with a friend to audition for Les Miserables on Broadway. Though her mother told her that she didn't know how to sing, Lea went anyway...and wound up with the plum part of Young Cosette. What followed were Broadway stints in <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i> and <i>Ragtime</i>, but her big break came when she was cast to play the tragic and sexually naive Wendla in the 2007 Tony-winning musical Spring Awakening. The gutsy role, in which Lea starred opposite her best friend and ""soul mate,"" Jonathan Groff (who plays her new love interest on Glee), featured a sexually charged scene.<br /><br /><br /><br />One theatergoer who saw her provocative performance was <i>Glee</i>'s co-creator and executive producer, Ryan Murphy, who summoned her to test for the part. On her way to the audition, Lea was in a car accident (in a rental!) while driving onto the Hollywood studio lot. With only minutes to spare, Lea begged the Fox security guards to look after the mangled vehicle while she hoofed it to the soundstage.<br /><br /><br /><br />After crashing a car, most people would be too rattled to perform, but Lea nailed the audition, nabbed the part, and moved west. Though Lea admits, ""Los Angeles has been good to me,"" Lea is quick to add that ""New York is who I am,"" and it's where she lives when she's not filming. ""It took me a long time to put together my group of friends in New York. Also, every member of my family lives within 30 minutes [of each other] there."" Another reason her heart belongs to the East Coast: It's where her boyfriend, whose name Lea chooses to keep quiet, lives.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Go behind the scenes on our June cover shoot:</b><br /><br /><br /></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Lean on Me</b><br /><br /><br /><br />Fortunately, Lea and her castmates have formed a strong bond. ""<i>Glee</i> is a family, and Lea is the mom figure,"" says Matthew Morrison, an old theater friend of Lea's, who now plays the show's glee-clubbercum-teacher Will Schuester. ""She is the fearless leader."" But even fearless leaders can have their vulnerable moments. ""We did this event in Australia and were accosted by fans,"" recalls Morrison. ""Lea got overwhelmed and broke down crying. It was too much for her and she had to leave. It was overwhelming for all of us, but she's the one young people identify with, so everyone wanted a piece of her.""<br /><br /><br /><br />A big part of Lea's appeal-besides her amazing voice-is her accessible beauty. Part Italian, part Jewish, she's a refreshing change from the waifish blondes who often populate screens both big and small. Although Lea proudly proclaims she's ""the only girl in her high school class not to get a nose job,"" she isn't immune to look-perfect pressure. ""I love myself, the way I look, my body,"" she says, ""but sometimes I can't help but feel insecure here. It plays with your head.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Let's Get Physical</b><br /><br /><br /><br />Still, Lea is more interested in being healthy than striving to be a specific dress size. She stays in shape by tackling the trails in picturesque Runyon Canyon-a 15-minute drive from her apartment-and working out with L.A. health counselor Devon Butler. Something else that keeps her fit: starring in such a physically demanding show, which often involves elaborate dance routines, not to mention 14- to 16-hour workdays. And she recently became hooked on organic and vegetarian fare-more for what it does for her well-being than her waistline. (Check out her eating and exercise tips in the sidebar below.)<br /><br /><br /><br />After her morning climbing session, for example, she hits the Belgian chain cafe Le Pain Quotidien for a tofu scramble and orange juice, and begins talking passionately about her commitment to a primarily vegan diet. ""My idea of heaven used to be relaxing at home with a cheese plate and champagne,"" she says. Then she read The New York Times best-selling diet book Skinny Bitch ""and it slapped me in the face."" An animal lover who has ""always had a problem eating meat,"" Lea was especially shaken by the information on farming practices and decided to give up dairy too. ""Coming from an Italian family, you can imagine [they] couldn't understand. But they respected my decision,"" she says. She still eats fish, but laments, ""I feel bad about it because fish are animals too.""<br /><br /><br /><br />When brunch is over, she slips into her sleek black BMW, complete with a GO CHEERIOS! bumper sticker (a nod to the mean-girls cheering squad on Glee), and starts navigating her way through the streets of West Hollywood. She talks about the <i>Glee</i> national tour, which features the show's cast members performing songs from the show, and filming season two's new episodes. It's a lot to juggle, and the reality of that is sinking in.<br /><br /><br /><br />""I got home last night and was like, Oh my God, how will I be able to function?"" Lea says. ""But I woke up this morning and was fine.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Not surprising, really. When Lea hits a wall, she just figures out a way to climb it.<br /><br /><br /></p><p><b>These Simple Pleasures Make Lea, Well Gleeful</b><br /><i>The Kind Diet</i> (Rodale Books)<br /><br /><br />""It's [a book by Alicia Silverstone] about being good to your body and the planet. I'm a foodie, but I think it's much more fun to find things on the menu that are good for me.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Pink</i><br /><br /><br />""'Dear Mr. President' is an amazing song. I don't think we've seen everything she is [yet]."" Some of Lea's other faves include Barbra Streisand, Celine Dion, and Alanis Morissette.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Grey's Anatomy<i><br /><br /><br />In fact, when L ea arrived in L.A., her goal was to land a guest spot on the show.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sunday Dinners with Her Family<br /><br /><br />""All of us: Grandma, Grandpa, aunts, uncles. I have 19 cousins just on one side!"" says Lea, who flies home ""every chance I get.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Green Day's Broadway Musical <i>American Idiot</i><br /><br /><br />""I was watching clips on YouTube,"" says Lea, who partied with the band after the Grammys. ""It will knock people's socks off!""<br /><br /><br /><br />Luxury Beauty Products<br /><br /><br />Lollia bath products (""I relax by taking baths""); Bliss scrubs and body washes; MoroccanOil shampoo and conditioner, which aren't tested on animals (""They make my hair look great!""); and AmorePacific's eye and face creams.<br /><br /><br /></i></i></p><i><i><p><b>6 Changes that did her body good</b><br /><br /><br /><br />Lea began working with health counselor Devon Butler because she wanted more energy. She got that and a hotter bod. Here, her best tips:<br /><br /><br /><br />1/ Just say ohm. ""We do a lot of yoga during red-carpet season,"" says Butler. ""Lea has so much attention on her, and this is so calming."" Lea especially likes Bikram, poses and breathing exercises done in a heated studio for deeper stretching and stress relief.<br /><br /><br /><br />2/ Vary the pace. Lea and Butler incorporate short bursts of cardio into her workouts. ""Just think of it like a roller coaster: It takes more energy to go up, up, up and then drop for a bit than to stay at the same level,"" says Butler. ""It burns more sugars, which ends up leaning you out."" For example, Lea will walk at a speed of four miles per hour at a 10 incline for three or four minutes.<br /><br /><br /><br />3/ Toss it around. If Lea doesn't have enough time to do a full-on workout, she will exercise with a medicine ball. ""She holds a six-pound ball to her chest, squats down, and as she stands up, she throws the ball to me. I'm standing 15 feet away, so it's a long throw,"" says Butler. ""She'll do three sets of 20. It really gets her heart rate up.""<br /><br /><br /><br />4/ Eating healthy doesn't have to be heinous. For breakfast, for example, Lea has steel-cut oatmeal made with soy milk, or a tofu scramble.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/yoga/yoga-for-your-joints,Yoga,24,19,12,0,0,1,0,0,,Total Body Yoga,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/yoga-for-joints.jpg,"<p>Everyone has panic-ridden moments when a life coach, therapist, masseuse, and <a href=""/health/try-acupuncture"">acupuncturist</a> rolled into one-for free-could really come in handy. Thinking that sounds like an implausible saint? Look in the mirror and think again. If you can find 3 minutes, you can be your own uber-expert. </p><p><a target=""_self"" href=""/yoga/yin-yoga"">Yin yoga</a>, characterized by long-held, passive poses that work your connective tissues and train your mind rather than muscles, manages to squeeze the benefits of all of those highly-paid professionals into one powerfully recharging practice. Cardio addicts, workaholics, and anyone else in need of a break, listen up. A few minutes in the morning or before bed in a yin pose or two can rejuvenate your mind, fool your joints into thinking they're years younger, and teach you some valuable life skills-all at once. Think of it as investing in yourself without spending a dime on a professional or even a yoga class. </p><p>Popularized by West-Coast instructors Paul Grilley and Sarah Powers, yin yoga is taken from Taoist yoga, as opposed to today's more popular styles, which come from the Hindu tradition. Taoism, in short, describes everything in terms of yin and yang. The black and white circle-often associated with other Chinese practices like Tai Chi-comes to mind, representing the opposing natures of all things. In the case of yoga, yang describes other hatha styles you may be familiar with, your <a href=""/yoga/types-of-yoga"">Anusara</a>, <i>ashtanga</i>, <a href=""/yoga/bikram-yoga"">Bikram</a>, what have you. These practices are more physically active and focused on building strength in the muscles and bones. Whereas this passive style of yoga, focused on nourishing the connective tissues of the joints can be described as yin. </p><p><b>Joint Responsibility</b><br />Most people go through life without ever thinking about exercising their ligaments and fascia. But given that these are the source of both our <a href=""/fitness/stability-ball-circles"">stability</a> and flexibility, it does seem that they should get a little love too. As we age and keep up our active hobbies-running, biking, swimming, sports, vinyasa yoga-building up our muscles and bones (which is healthy), the ligaments and fascia ""slowly shorten to the minimum length needed to accommodate our activities,"" Grilley explains in his book Yin Yoga. He compares the after-effect to shrink-wrapped joints. Basically, the stronger bones and muscles intersect at the joints crowding them and limiting mobility. </p><p>But what good are pumped-up body parts if you can't use them? It's like how one glass of wine can help you relax around your in-laws but a few more can backfire-making you too paranoid to open your mouth or too oblivious to know when you've said too much. And who can argue with Grilley's theory when the most regimented of athletes are frequently benched by an injury to the knee or shoulder? The good news is that flexibility and agility can be maintained-or restored-by working the connective tissues in addition to working the muscles, he says. But this has to be done in a specific way. </p><p>""Connective tissue doesn't respond to brief, rhythmical stretches the way muscles do,"" Grilley says. ""Connective tissues are tough and fibrous and stretch best when pulled slowly like taffy."" Which is why yin poses are held for several minutes at a time-and mostly done sitting or lying down with the muscles relaxed to ensure the joints take the stress, not the muscles. Think your teacher is torturing you with 45 seconds in <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/revolved-chair-pose""><b>revolved chair pose</b></a>? Try 5 minutes in <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/yin-yoga-sequence?page=9""><b>saddle pose</b></a>. In fact it's not uncommon for an advanced practitioner to hold a yin pose for as long as 10, 20, or even 25 minutes. Don't worry, you can start with 1 minute. It's around the 3-minute mark, though, that synovial fluid, our joints' natural lube, is stimulated and released into the connective tissues being worked, making them more supple and agile, yin teacher Dina Amsterdam explains. It's the natural decrease of synovial fluid as we get older that makes us stiff in the morning and causes our joints to crack. Lengthening and compressing the connective tissues regularly, which ends up lubricating them, is just like oiling a squeaky wheel.</p><p><b>All-in-One Poses</b><br />Yin yogis also believe that the long holds propagate more than healthy joints by stimulating the body's meridians, or energy channels. Traditionally known as nadis in yoga, these energy pathways running throughout the body, are said to be concentrated in the hips and lower back region-the two areas that yin yoga focuses on primarily. That's why Amsterdam likens a yin practice to giving yourself acupuncture while exercising your joints and meditating. </p><p>""The sensations in the body are very intense,"" she says. ""In order to get those physiological and energetic benefits, you really have to learn to be with yourself and relax amidst the discomfort of the physical body and also the reactions the mind and the emotional body have toward that discomfort."" You've heard something like that on the mat before probably, but most of us have never had to keep it up for more than a minute. You know the deep sensations that a pose like <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/pigeon-pose"">pigeon</a> triggers? As you relax and stay there beyond the typical 45-second mark, gravity keeps tugging at the connective tissues of your hips, slowly lengthening them, and the feeling becomes more and more acute.</p><p>Sarah Powers incorporates Buddhist philosophy into her yin yoga. And it's not hard to see how it fits if you know a little about the religion and the so-called Four Noble Truths at its core. In a single yin posture you'll experience all of them: the truth of suffering (your hips don't lie-ask Shakira); the truth of the cause of suffering (gravity yanking on your connective tissues); the truth of the end of suffering (can 5 minutes really last forever?); and the truth of the path that leads to the end of suffering. There's the toughie. But the same tricks you use to make it through 30 seconds of <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/warrior-3-pose"">warrior III</a> can work here too, and there's not even any alignment or right or wrong to worry about. </p><p>Amsterdam, who comes from an <a target=""_self"" href=""/yoga/iyengar-yoga"">Iyengar yoga</a> and Buddhist background and learned yin from Powers over a decade ago, also melds mindfulness into her yin practice. And why not? Research has shown mindfulness meditation has a multitude of benefits, from helping people gain better control over their thought processes to reducing stress, depression, neuroticism, binge-eating tendencies, and pain, to increasing compassion, preventing burnout and even lowering blood pressure. And it's not as complicated as it sounds. Amsterdam simply encourages her students to focus on their breath or awareness while in yin poses. For her tips on how to do this, see the <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/yin-yoga-sequence"">yin sequence</a>. </p><p>""To me it's all about the relationship you cultivate with yourself,"" she explains. ""I would imagine that the marathon race gets really difficult during the last quarter, when your physical body has given out. You just have to go on will at a certain point-no matter how hard you've trained. You get to a certain point of exhaustion and you have to figure out how to move beyond the exhaustion. And learning how to be as deeply relaxed as possible inside discomfort in yin yoga would translate directly into how you can be in a relationship with yourself when you're running-or doing anything else."" </p><p><b>Under the Western Radar</b><br />While yin yoga, born in the 1980s, is still gaining notoriety this side of the glob, Amsterdam, named the ""Best Classic Yoga Teacher in San Francisco"" by San Francisco magazine last year, is using her popularity to help make yin mainstream. In addition to teaching yin-specific workshops across the country, she incorporates yin poses into the beginning of all of her packed Flow classes to help her students connect with themselves and the sensations in their bodies.</p><p>""People naturally have a bit of resistance when they're first exposed to yin,"" Amsterdam says. ""But 98 percent of them end up loving it."" She adds that coming from the alignment-focused Iyengar mentality, she questioned the safety of the passive poses at first herself. Now she sees their value. ""One of the things that's really brilliant about yin yoga is that it teaches students how to listen more closely to the sensations of their bodies,"" she says. ""So that they know the difference between a positive sense of discomfort, like an ache, and the moment that moves into a realm that feels unsafe."" She adds that she is constantly reminding her students to back off of poses as soon as a sensation feels sharp, electric or ""scary"" in any way. </p><p>""Each yin yoga pose is like a simulation of life experience,"" Amsterdam says. ""Life is uncomfortable, and [in yin yoga] you have the opportunity to pay attention in slow motion to your internal reaction to your own discomfort. That's something that this culture does not ask us or teach us how to do."" Maybe you've had a yoga teacher ask you to ""find your edge"". In yin, you find your edge, fall off of it maybe, and keep hanging on anyway. The idea is to train your mind not to react to any of that-just to watch it all happen. </p><p>Perhaps that's why the practice makes such a natural complement to the inherently yang nature of our modern Western world that has us racing to work, lunch, the dry cleaners, and soccer practice. Always living in fast forward leaves us little time to evaluate if the things we're doing are as good for us as we think they are. A yin practice can teach you to slow down, listen to your body, gain control over your mind, and relax-all at the same time. Put that way, maybe it does fit right into our culture after all: It's yoga's ultimate multi-tasker.</p><p>Get the <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/yin-yoga-sequence"">yin sequence</a>.</p>",Sequences & Workouts
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/stop-canceling-plans,Life,22,19,11,2,0,0,1,0,,Don't Be a Flake: How To Stay Committed To Your Plans,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0901-flake-no-more.jpg,"My friend Margo introduced me to her <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/getting-along-with-your-sister"">friend</a> Erin, a gallery owner, via e-mail with a resolute ""Meet!"" typed into the subject line. She explained that I was looking to interview Erin for a story about one of her artists. Erin zapped back a promising (and instant!) reply. <br /><br /><b>erin:</b> <i>Let's def meet. How about lunch next Wed?</i><br /><b>me:</b> <i>Sounds great. I'll swing by your office at 1.</i><br /><b>erin:</b> <i>Done. See you then. </i><br /><br />And just like that, Erin and I had carved our plans into cyber stone, aka mutual Outlook <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty-and-style/beauty-tips-0"">calendars</a>. Or so I thought, until I received an e-mail from Erin the morning of, asking to push our meeting to the following Wednesday. She blamed a last-minute conference call with her business partner, which I excused since I'm not on her payroll. But an hour before our new meeting, she apologized in a second e-mail for needing to take her dog to the vet. Fair enough, I sighed; I love my puppy too. But when Erin begged off a third appointment because she was ""too tired to focus on our conversation,"" having stayed up all night with her sick dog, and now her sick boyfriend--well, I lost it. <br /><br />Of course, this simply meant I postured from behind my laptop and then vented to my husband, Scott, over the phone. How could Erin <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/losing-a-girl-friend"">flake</a> not one but three times?! Keeping this meeting was about respect, professionalism...and...and integrity! I had a deadline, and we shared a friend. Did Erin not feel indebted to anyone but herself?<br /><br />Pissed off and deflated by derailed expectations, I did what came naturally. Instead of telling Erin how I felt, I canceled dinner with Scott that night. I was in no mood to talk about my day. In my mind, I'd rescued him from a bad experience. <br /><br />Not necessarily, experts say. I merely flaked it forward.<br /><br /><br /><b>What goes around</b><br />I'd be a big fat hypocrite if I didn't confess to canceling on more than just Scott--and pretty regularly. I've ditched small dates, like drinks with a neighbor, and have no qualms about skipping holiday plans to avoid six hours in traffic. ""There is a power hierarchy involved in flaking,"" says Kerul Kassel, author of <i>Stop Procrastinating Now</i>, who has consulted for clients like Sony, Volvo, and NASA. ""It's a professional liability to cancel lunch with your boss,"" Kassel says. But lunch with your mom? She won't hold you as accountable, and there are fewer consequences for doing so. Kassel says that who slaps our wrist and how hard can dictate our social devotion to others--especially when there's potential fun to be had in other, more spontaneous occasions. ""We also cancel because there are too many opportunities to tempt and distract us,"" she says, adding that there's no real consequence or social pressure for flaking. ""If you hold someone to their word, you're considered judgmental instead of rational and ethical."" <br /><br />I'll admit that I didn't want to call Erin on her lax attendance policy because I didn't want to be the uptight loser who whines about irresponsibility and its repercussions. Nobody likes or wants to be that girl, especially me. Then again, I'm no doormat, either. And if accountability isn't built into plan-making, the same short attention span that causes us to flake in the first place will likely encourage us to move on to new friends when the old ones flake out. Dan Buccino, clinical social worker and assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, suggests nailing down very specific plans in advance and confirming the day before. The trick, he says, is to subtly remind the flaker how long it took you to move things around to accommodate her schedule, say, or how far you're traveling to see her. Try something like ""I'll leave my apartment at five so I can be at your office by six."" <br /><br />To be fair, Erin had overbooked herself the first two times she backed out. Like many women, I, too, often bite off more than I can chew in a day. Kassel says that women have a greater tendency to bail than men: ""Women fear people will hate them if they say no,"" she says. ""So we promise to juggle, and then we notice at the last minute that it's impossible to do everything and be everywhere.""""We've become dramatically more irresponsible about managing schedules and weighing options,"" says David Gruder, Ph.D., author of <i>The New IQ: How Integrity Intelligence Serves You, Your Relationships, and Our World</i> and a psychology professor at the California Institute for Human Science, where he teaches what he calls ""commitment competence."" Gruder points to research on multitasking that says the more we try to do, the less we do any of it well. No matter how good our intentions are when we overextend ourselves, canceling erodes relationships. ""If you live in a frenzy of multitasking and overscheduling, you do things badly and earn a reputation as being unreliable,"" Buccino says. ""And when you're too quick to accommodate and then don't follow through, you'll eventually spend nights alone--and it won't be by choice."" <br /><br /><br /><b>Stop the madness</b><br />As I speak with Gruder and company, it becomes abundantly clear that if I don't create a few boundaries soon, our society's permissive cancel culture will continue to let me upset others, who'll then piss me off over and over again. <br /><br />So I decide to make Erin my guinea pig. When I reply to her third ""Let's resked?"" e-mail, I suggest sticking to a realistic plan and remembering that we are beholden to others (my editor, her client). Erin is not only receptive, she is downright apologetic--and proactive, hiking 30 blocks to meet me near my office, though our original plan was to meet in hers. <br /><br />Buoyed by this success, I begin adding guidelines: Now I make sure to confirm plans the night before; replace long meetings with less time-taxing phone calls or coffees; and drop by an event for only an hour rather than pulling a no-show. Buccino also suggests I allow breathing room between dates so I don't feel overwhelmed at the last minute--and take notes on my morphing schedule in a plans journal. By doing this, he says, I can see how often I cancel the plans I was once excited to make. When booking a do-over, he says, be precise about date, time, and place--and agree to it out loud. ""This way you'll both hold yourselves accountable,"" he explains. ""It's much easier to flake when your plans are vague because you have nothing specific to look forward to.""<br /><br />""It all comes down to becoming a better dealer,"" Buccino says. ""If you make a habit of pinning down plans, you'll avoid the ethical calculus."" It's a lofty goal, but the upshot is that I will tame my fellow flakers by proxy. And if I have trouble sticking to this plan--well, I can always sneak into my comfort zone for a sec. It's not like anyone will hold me accountable.<br /><br />At least not yet.<br /><br />",Simplify Your Life

Exercise seemed like torture, and it was easier to grab takeout than cook for herself. In fact, it wasn't unusual for her to eat out at every meal-a sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich on her morning commute, junky catered work lunches, and slices of pizza for dinner. She gained 60 pounds over the course of four years, reaching a high of 236.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Change</b><br /><br />When Misty visited her ob-gyn in February 2009, the doctor suggested testing her blood sugar levels-and the test revealed she was prediabetic. ""I didn't want to have to take pills or give myself a shot every day for the rest of my life. I was only 23. It scared me and made me kind of mad at myself,"" she says. Determined to avoid diabetes and its complications, she took control of the scale.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Lifestyle</b><br /><br />Misty immediately bought an elliptical machine and started logging 30 to 60 minutes on it five or six days a week while watching her favorite prime-time shows. ""I made a deal with myself: If I'm not on the elliptical, then I don't watch at all,"" she says. Despite her dedication, her weight loss stalled at 20 pounds. ""I thought my scale was broken!"" she says.<br /><br /><br /><br />A food journal soon revealed that while Misty was eating the right foods-eggs, protein shakes, salads, lean meats, and veggies-she was eating far too much of them. ""My 'healthy' chicken and pasta dinner had more than 1,000 calories! I was clueless,"" she says. She scaled back portions and added nutritious snacks like carrots and hummus to avoid bingeing at meals-and dropped 40 more pounds by the year's end, enough to bring her back from the brink of diabetes.<br /><br /><br /><br />When her elliptical broke in February 2010, she took up running. She'd tried running a year before but quit after barely making it around the block. This time she kept plugging away until, six weeks later, she could run two miles. In April, another 20 pounds lighter, Misty competed in her first 5-K. ""Running helped me break through plateaus,"" she says. ""This is the first time in my adult life that I weigh less than 150!""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Reward</b><br /><br />Now that she's no longer carrying around an extra 90 pounds, Misty is healthier, lighter on her feet, and full of energy. ""I went from five cups of coffee a day to two, and I feel invigorated instead of exhausted after a six-mile hike,"" she says. ""I feel accomplished. If I can make this change, anyone can.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Misty's Tips</b><br /><br /><i>Celebrate, sister.</i></p><p>""When I lost 70 pounds, I bought myself a diamond watch as a reward for my accomplishment.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Plan ahead.</i><br /><br />""Before I leave work, I decide which exercise-elliptical, workout DVD, or run-I'm going to do that day. This way it's set in my mind and there are no other options.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Diversify your dairy.</i><br /><br />""I make white sauces and dips healthy by swapping heavy cream for nutritious, low-cal almond milk.""</p><p></p><p><br /><b>Are you a weight loss winner? <a href=""mailto:Youloseyougain@womenshealthmag.com"">Tell us</a> your story and you could be featured in the magazine!

Dr. Brooke Kalanick, N.D., MS, Lac, knows. She is co-author of the book <i>Ultimate You</i>, a body makeover plan that uses cutting-edge training and eating strategies to set up the optimal fat-burning environment in your body. (Her co-author, Joe Dowdell, created the 4-phase fitness plan in <i>Ultimate You</i>, as well as this month's <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/bikini-workout"">Tone Up for a Two-Piece workout</a>.)We chatted by email with Dr. Brooke about her hormone-focused approach to weight loss, and about the secrets of life-long metabolism mastery.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Women's Health:</b> In <i>Ultimate You</i> you write ""in order to lose fat one should focus less on calories and more on the way food effect's one's hormones.""Why are hormones so critical to weight loss?<br /> <br /><br /><br /><b>Brooke Kalanick:</b> Food is more than calories; it contains information, or a message, for your body. One hundred calories of baked potato gives you 100 calories of energy, but its high carb load triggers the hormone insulin, sending the message to your body to store fat. One hundred calories of chicken breast sends the message to burn fat, by triggering a hormone called glucagon.<br /><br /><br /><br />And it goes beyond the commonly talked about metabolic hormones like insulin. Our sex hormones have profound effects on our amount of body fat, as well as where we store it, and this is overlooked in most nutrition advice. Simply look at a man and a woman's body shape and you'll see the effects of the sex hormones on our physique. Estrogen for example, fills out our hips, giving us a feminine shape, but when it's dominating a woman's hormonal landscape [estrogen] can make it very hard to shed fat-particularly from trouble spots like the hips and thighs.<br /><br /><br /><br />The real trick of it all is that all of these hormones work together; no one is good nor bad, nor should be singled out--but instead all orchestrated in a symphony where everyone's in harmony.<i>Ultimate You</i> tries to teach women about all of the hormones affecting their physique-without being a crash course in biochemistry, but in a practical way that helps them set things back in balance.</p><p><b>WH:</b> Should a person get their hormone levels checked before starting to eat as outlined in your book?</p><p></p><p><br /><b>BK:</b> It's definitely not necessary; we provide lots of questionnaires that help the reader use their own symptoms as a guide to target specific hormones. Testing can be useful. However in some cases, such as with female hormones, disruption is often not detected on standard lab testing. Consider that a blood test is a snapshot of a woman's hormonal landscape-and what we really need to see is the entire movie. Same is true with stress hormones like cortisol.<br /><br /><br /></p><p>So other testing-such as salivary testing-over the course of a month with female hormones or throughout an entire day for adrenal hormones (also stress hormones)-are much more useful.To get this type of testing find a doctor that practices functional medicine (<a href=""http://www.functionalmedicine.org"" target=""new"">functionalmedicine.org</a> or <a href=""http://www.naturopathic.org"" target=""new"">naturopathic.org</a>). However if you suspect you are insulin resistant, having your MD run what's called a fasting insulin along with your fasting blood sugar via a simple blood test can be useful. I consider a fasting insulin test result above 5 to show insulin resistance (which is lower than the standard reference range). Thyroid function is also seen on blood tests. We provide a list of all the tests necessary to see the full hormone picture in Phase 4 of <i>Ultimate You</i>.If you suspect you have a thyroid issue, testing is a great idea and to get all of the information; ask your doctor to run all of those tests we list.<br /><br /><br /></p><p><b>WH:</b> You offer a suggested week of menus in the book, but not a day-by-day eating plan. Why not?<br /> <br /><br /><br /><b>BK:</b> <i>Ultimate You</i> is not a diet, but rather a lifestyle. It is about empowerment and education. Diet books that lay out a day-by-day eating plan can set up the reader for failure later. When the book's over and there's no one telling you what to eat every day, people find themselves back to their old habits.I encourage all of my patients, and the readers of <i>Ultimate You</i>, to take the time to understand what makes up a meal: fibrous veggies, lean protein, healthy fat, and-if desired-an optimal starchy carb in your prescribed amount (phase 2 of <i>Ultimate You</i> helps you find your carb tipping point). When they understand the what and the why, they can look at dozens of meal ideas and easily substitute other veggies or proteins they prefer. So, not only do they get to eat foods they enjoy more, but they learn how to create meals for themselves for the long term.<br /><br /><br /><br />We gave two different week-long menus as guidelines for women who feel they need that type of structure to get started, and we included a large recipe appendix as well. The recipes in <i>Ultimate You</i> can be easily modified and that taste great - so you can feel good feeding your family or guests, and no one will feel like they are on a ""diet"".<br /> <br /><br /></p><p><b>WH:</b> What's the single most powerful step one can take toward optimizing one's metabolism?<br /> <br /><br /><br /><b>BK:</b>Manage your stress. It might sound crazy as we consider stress to be ""calorie free,"" right? But in our modern world we are so inundated with stress and ""busy-ness"" that our sleep, appetite and cravings are all out of whack, making it much harder to make better food choices, and much easier to create a fat-storing, vs. a fat-burning, situation in our bodies.<br /><br /><br /><br />Stress hormones have one main job: get your blood sugar up (it goes back to an ancient survival mechanism where stress meant your body needed fuel-sugar-to either run from a predator or fight it, or survive a long winter without food, etc).In our modern world our stresses don't need so much fuel; they usually happen sitting at our desks or stuck in traffic, but the mechanism is the same. Unrelenting, repetitive stress turns on fat storage and it triggers cravings for fatty and sugary foods-making the choice to eat the veggie omelet for breakfast over the doughnut a battle of wills.<br /><br /><br /></p><p>Our life stressors sometimes feel beyond our control, but some stresses are well within our control. Eating breakfast religiously (one that includes protein, veggies, and some healthy fats) and getting on a meal schedule of eating every 3 - 4 hours avoids any added stress and fat-storing hormone release.<br /><br /><br /></p><p><b>WH:</b> Naturopathic physicians receive a rigorous and deep education in nutrition. What aspects of your training were most helpful in designing the <i>Ultimate You</i> eating guidelines?</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>BK:</b> During our first of four years in Naturopathic medical school we learn the foundations of Naturopathic medicine: first, do no harm; be a teacher and guide to the patient; treat the cause<br />treat the whole person; aid in prevention and support the body's natural ability to heal itself(this is called the <i>vis medicatrix naturae</i> in naturopathic medicine, known as <i>Qi</i> or <i>Prahna</i> in other forms of medicine). </p><p></p><p><br />Those principles become the framework for treating any patient or condition. </p><p></p><p><br />So, excess weight, for instance, is not the issue, it's the symptom-telling us something internal is off. When it comes to helping someone shed fat I look at why they are having trouble getting or staying lean in the first place: is it digestion, stress, female hormones, brain chemistry, food allergies, heavy metals, mental roadblocks, etc? And I treat that-the cause.Of course, it may be more than one of those things, so it's important to treat the whole person. By working in the hormone realm I'm always helping patients get healthier as well as get leaner, thus preventing future health issues.A very disheartening stat is that 95% of people who lose weight fail to keep it off, so it's crucial to get those underlying factors set right so people can have lasting success and health. It's a lofty goal, but I would hope any women who follows <i>Ultimate You</i> would never need another ""diet book"" again.</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>WH:</b> What dieting myth would you most like to dispel?<br /> <br /><br /><br /><b>BK:</b>That simply eating more ""flat belly foods"" or ""fat torching antioxidant rich berries"" is the best way to shed fat. I see so many women who are loading up on whole grains for fiber, fruit or ""superfruit"" juices for antioxidants, and eating handfuls of organic nuts every day for those healthy fats. And they are gaining weight, their skin is breaking out, and they are totally confused and frustrated! Many of these healthy foods pack a big carb punch that can send a women's insulin through the roof.<br /><br /><br /><br />Food is medicine and as an ND (Naturopathic Doctor) I certainly love a diet rich in plant nutrients; I also encourage the consumption of healthy fats like nuts and avocado. But it's important to be clear on the goal when you are making dietary choices.If the goal is to increase antioxidants, then, yes, more fruit is a good way to go. If the goal is fat loss, then 1 - 2 fruits per day is the limit for most women. Nuts are great fats, but they are also a great way to rack up calories, ¼ cup of nuts or 2 tsp nuts a couple times per day will give better fat- burning results.<br /><br /><br /><br />Finally, when you think fiber, think veggies, not grains! For fat loss, veggie fiber gives you all the satiating, healthy digestion-promoting fiber without the carb load.So while a healthy diet might not be the best fat-burning diet, the <i>Ultimate You</i> fat burning diet is most definitely a health diet-so, it's win win.</p><p></p><p><br /><b>WH:</b>Are there any favorite foods or eating tips of your own that didn't make it into the book?<br /><br /><br /></p><p><b>BK:</b>We certainly tried to cover it all in <i>Ultimate You</i>! It's quite long for a book of its kind. We did dedicate an entire chapter to prepping for the ultimate you, and I think that's the most important, yet often overlooked, part of weight loss. It's easy to show someone the hormonally-balanced, fat-burning, and tasty <i>Ultimate You</i> nutrition plan, but if they can't follow it, it's useless.</p><p></p><p><br />Most everyone does great right out of the gate; they are motivated and excited, they really rock it . . .for about 3 - 4 weeks. Then life happens again-that same life that created a body they weren't satisfied with in the first place. </p><p></p><p><br />It takes time, money, and energy to be healthy-and it takes time, money, and energy to be sick and unhealthy. Take the time to get clear on why you want to lose weight and change your body. The reason better be a good one (one worth getting up early to workout for, one worth skipping cocktails with the girls for, one worth spending a little more on high quality foods for)! Get clear, commit to that goal, get your life set up to support that goal. Fat loss requires being a little more strict for a period of time, then you get to loosen the reigns and find where your livable diet is. Knowing it is ""just for now"" takes away that restricted feeling most women have when they are trying to lose weight.Put some resources towards getting ready for your new healthy lifestyle, get support if you need it, and take the time to get set up for success.</p><p></p><p></p>",

The language has been dead for a thousand years or so, and you don't see many American teenagers carting Sanskrit texts around as they do Latin ones. Yogis, however, are a different story. The exotic-sounding terms are commonplace inside the walls of yoga studios. And this can be an obstacle; you wouldn't jump at the chance to take a kickboxing class in Swahili, would you? Skim our dime-sized dictionary and see if you find yourself feeling a bit more fluent-or at least faking it convincingly-by your next class.</p><p><br /><strong>asana</strong> (AH-sah-nah)<br />Literally, it means ""seat,"" but it's any yoga posture. A series of <em>asanas</em>, or poses, makes up a <em>vinyasa</em>, or flow.<br /><br /><br /></p><p><strong>chakras</strong> (CHA-kruhz)<br />The Sanskrit term <em>chakra</em> literally translates as ""wheel"" or ""disc,"" referring to the shape of these whirling energy centers that control the body's vital organs. They correspond to nerve plexes, ganglia, and glands. When one's organs are malfunctioning, yogis believe it is because they lack sufficient life energy (hence, ""My <em>chakras</em> are out of balance""). The seven principal <em>chakras</em> are situated along the spinal cord, from the base to the cranium and relate to reason, cognition, memory, willpower, divine love, divine sight, and illumination. Seven others exist below the spine and relate to fear, anger, envy, selfishness, and other unenlightened traits. <em>Chakras</em> are typically depicted as colorful and resembling a lotus flower.<br /><br /></p><p><a target=""_self"" href=""/yoga/kundalini-yoga""><strong>kundalini</strong></a> (kun-duh-LEE-ni) Literally, ""coiled up."" <a target=""_self"" href=""/yoga/kundalini-yoga""><em>Kundalini</em></a> energy is the life force that lies dormant in our bodies. It is often depicted as a coiled up serpent at the base of the spine; the theory is that practicing certain spiritual disciplines can cause the serpent to spring awake. The <em>kundalini</em> style of yoga focuses on the centers in the body (chakras) that can release <em>kundalini</em> energy. <br /><br /><br /></p><p><strong>namaste</strong> (NAH-MAH-STAY) Means ""May the divine light in me greet the divine light in you."" You know it's coming at the end of class when your teacher puts her hands in prayer position and bows her head. Students say it back to convey, ""Thank you for class.""</p><p></p><p><strong>om</strong> (OH-MMMM) A long and loud sigh or hum chanted at the beginning and end of a yoga practice. This is intended to warm up the lungs and focus and quiet the mind. The sound of om is said to be ""the sound of all things,"" all the noise and music in the universe combined. </p><p></p><p><strong>prana</strong> (PRAH-nah)<br />The ""life energy"" that keeps us alive and thriving. The ancient Greeks called it <em>pneuma</em> and the ancient Hebrews, <em>ruah</em>. The three major sources of <em>prana</em> are air, sun, and ground.<br /><br /> </p><p><strong>pranayama</strong> (PRAH-nah-yah-mah) Controlled breathing technique. These exercises regulating the breath are intended to calm and focus the mind for <em>asana</em> practice or seated meditation. </p><p></p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/corpse-pose""><strong>savasana</strong></a> (SHA-vass-ah-nah) Translates as ""<a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/corpse-pose"">corpse pose</a>."" This is the full-body relaxation pose done lying on the back, completely still with eyes closed, usually as the last <em>asana</em> in the practice. Focus is on relaxing every part of the body from toes to jaw muscles. <br /><br /><br /></p><p><strong>shakti</strong> (SHOCK-tee) In Sanskrit, it means ""power"" or ""energy."" Different from the life force that <em>prana</em> refers to, <em>shakti</em> typically refers to the power of the god Shiva, which pervades all of existence; the pure consciousness of all form. Manifestations include <em>kriya shakti</em> (action) and <em>icha shakti</em> (desire, love). No worries if you don't quite grasp this one-you won't be missing much in class. </p><p></p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""/sun-salutation-poses""><strong>surya namaskara</strong></a> (SUE-ree-ah NAH-mas-car-ah)<br />aka <a target=""_blank"" href=""/sun-salutation-poses"">sun salutation</a>. A series, or <em>vinyasa</em> (see below), of poses that warm up the body.

OK, she was having trouble dragging herself off the <a target=""_blank"" href=""/health/sleep-better-0"">Serta</a> every morning--but with two small <a target=""_blank"" href=""/health/protect-your-fertility"">children</a>, it was normal to feel fatigued, right? And those nagging aches? Well, considering that she played tennis and took spinning classes, not all that shocking. Besides, the youthful 39-year-old was still surprised when grocery-store clerks called her ""ma'am."" What was there to worry about? </p><p>So when the New Jersey resident started to feel <a target=""_blank"" href=""/fitness/sports-injuries"">sharp pain</a> in her shoulder blade, she sucked it up. ""Some people would have gone to the <a target=""_blank"" href=""/health/the-top-doctors-in-america"">doctor</a>,"" she says. ""But I hadn't felt my best in so long--one problem or another was nagging at me."" </p><p>Soon, though, she was feeling breathless and running a fever. When she finally complained of her symptoms to her primary-care doctor, in May 2007--several months after they began--he diagnosed her with pneumonia and prescribed antibiotics. But two weeks later, Jen was feverish and having trouble breathing, so she went back to the doctor. This time, he referred her to a pulmonologist. Chest X-rays turned up a suspicious mass on her lung, and a CT scan confirmed it was a 15-centimeter tumor. She had aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a fast-growing <a target=""_blank"" href=""/health/the-top-doctors-in-america?page=3#Onc"">cancer</a> of the lymphatic system (part of the body's immune system). It's most common in 67-year-old men. ""I was scared,"" she says. ""I could sense that something was wrong, but I just kept thinking, 'I'm too young for this.'"" </p><p>Unfortunately, for many people her age, too young for cancer is a precarious spot to be in. Jen is a member of the disease's orphan generation--young adults left behind in the age of research and increasing survival rates. Because they and their <a target=""_blank"" href=""/health/top-doctors-for-women"">doctors</a> ignore signs that would scream ""cancer"" in someone older, they often go months without a proper diagnosis. What's worse: When some types of cancer are discovered, they tend to be the types that spread aggressively to other parts of the body, offering a slimmer chance of survival. </p><p>Although its biggest risk factor is usually age, cancer is still the top disease-related killer of young adults. According to 2007 estimates, there were more than 75,000 new cases in Americans ages 15 to 39, and the rates for some cancers are rising in that age group even as they hold steady for others. </p><p>The picture becomes bleaker when you compare survival rates. In the late 1970s, a 10-year-old diagnosed with cancer had about a 60 percent chance of seeing her 15th birthday; in the 1990s, 75 percent. Over the same period, the five-year survival rate for a 65-year-old leapt from about 45 percent to more than 65 percent. Now consider a 30-year-old: During the disco era they had a 70 percent chance of living for another five years. By the time 'N Sync ruled, that prognosis was still the same. </p><p>Clinical trials can help, but a study in the <i>Journal of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology</i> found that for many cancers, there are no trials for Gen-X/Yers. Since there's a link between clinical-trial enrollment and treatment success, young women living with cancer are at a disadvantage, says study author Peter Shaw, M.D., director of the adolescent and young adult oncology program at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. ""Because cancer in this group is more rare, there has been less effort to create new trials,"" says Brandon Hayes-Lattin, M.D., medical cochair of the Livestrong young-adult cancer program at the Oregon Health and Science University Cancer Institute in Portland. ""Currently, only 1 to 2 percent of twentysomethings participate in trials, compared with 50 percent of children."" </p><p>But researchers are trying to play catch-up. In 2006 the National Cancer Institute and the Lance Armstrong Foundation banded together to form the Livestrong Young Adult Alliance, a coalition of about 106 organizations trying to figure out why young adults' prognoses haven't improved. Scientists are studying the characteristics of the cancers most common in young adults, such as melanoma, to determine whether they respond to treatment differently in this age group than in others. </p><p>The good news: If you're a young woman, you're unlikely to get cancer. But if you do, you can avoid falling into the gap between diagnosis and effective treatment. Here's your battle plan. </p><p><b>Katherine Miller</b><br /><b>Occupation:</b> Med student, Des Moines University <br /><b>Home:</b> Des Moines, IA<br /><b>Type of cancer:</b> Stage IV colon cancer<br /><b>Age diagnosed:</b> 26 </p><p><b>Tune in to your body's signals</b><br />Like Jen Singer, many twenty and thirty somethings lead active lives--and it's easy to chalk up fatigue or odd aches and pains to <a target=""_blank"" href=""/fitness"">triathlon training</a> or running after a toddler. Take Katherine Miller, a first-year medical student at Des Moines University and a competitive swimmer and cross-country runner. In February 2005, Katherine called her mom complaining of abdominal pain that had been bothering her for months. The physician's assistant at her school's clinic had brushed it off as irritable bowel syndrome worsened by the stress of school. But the cramps were growing worse. </p><p>Irene Miller told Katherine to book an appointment with a specialist and hopped the next plane from her home in Florida to Des Moines. But by the time she arrived, Katherine had changed her mind about seeing a <a target=""_blank"" href=""/health/the-top-doctors-in-america?page=3#Gast"">gastroenterologist</a>. ""She said, 'I'm starting to feel better, Mom,'"" Irene recalls. </p><p>The reprieve was short-lived. Less than a month later, the pain returned with a vengeance, prompting her to rebook her appointment with the gastroenterologist, whom Katherine convinced to order an ultrasound after she was given yet another IBS diagnosis. Katherine got the devastating results on March 23, 2005--her 26th birthday and more than six months after her symptoms began. She had stage IV colon cancer. A 10-centimeter tumor had spread to her liver. </p><p>Within a week, she was undergoing aggressive chemotherapy at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the doctors were not encouraging. ""The most they would say was that her cancer was treatable,"" Irene says. ""I now know <i>treatable</i> is a lethal word."" Katherine died in September 2005. ""Had she gotten help earlier, she might be here today,"" Irene says. (Des Moines University has since launched the Katie Miller Young Adult Cancer Conference to raise awareness of the issues young-adult cancer patients face.) </p><p><b>Bridget Mooney</b><br /><b>Occupation:</b> Student, Boston University <br /><b>Home:</b> Boston, MA<br /><b>Type of cancer:</b> Stage IV breast cancer<br /><b>Age diagnosed:</b> 21 </p><p><b>Know that your doctor is not always right</b><br />Bridget Mooney was 21 and focused on finishing her last semester at Boston University when she felt a tiny <a target=""_blank"" href=""/health/daily-self-exams"">lump in her breast</a>. It never occurred to her that she might have cancer, so she waited for her yearly pelvic exam six weeks later at a nearby health clinic to mention it. </p><p>""I do feel something,"" the nurse practitioner told her during the exam. ""I could send you for follow-up testing, but because you're so young, I wouldn't recommend it."" Having her dismiss the lump was a relief for Bridget. Over the next three months, she rarely thought about it. But when she casually brought it up to her mother during graduation weekend, she insisted Bridget fly home to Baltimore for a second opinion. </p><p>""I thought she was being paranoid,"" Bridget says. ""Even the ultrasound technician said, 'Don't worry. I've been doing this for 20 years and I've never seen cancer in someone your age.'"" But afterward, as doctors discussed her test results in whispers, Bridget had a feeling something was wrong. When her doctor ordered a mammogram and a biopsy, she prepped herself for the worst. </p><p>It came the next day, when she was standing in line at Starbucks and her cellphone rang. Stage IV <a target=""_blank"" href=""/health/your-role-in-breast-cancer-research"">breast cancer</a>. Three years later, she's still being treated with aggressive chemotherapy. </p><p>Jen Singer also believes that doctors would have diagnosed her sooner had she been older. ""The oncologist shocked me when he said I'd probably had the tumor for about eight months before they found it,"" Jen says. ""Lymphoma symptoms are vague--fatigue, swollen glands, and fever--so doctors tend to think, 'You're a mother. Of course you're tired.'"" </p><p>Unfortunately, even young women who simply push for more testing may have to battle with their insurers to pay for it, particularly if they have no family history of cancer. For example, most insurance companies recommend annual mammograms for women over 40. Yet according to a report in the online journal <i>Breast Cancer Research,</i> early detection is even more critical for young women, in whom malignant breast tumors tend to be more aggressive. If your insurer refuses to cover a necessary procedure, contest the case and ask your doctor to support your claim. Most policyholders who challenge a decision will get at least partial coverage. </p><p><b>Michele Kerher</b><br /><b>Occupation:</b> Physical Therapist <br /><b>Home:</b> Chicago, IL<br /><b>Type of cancer:</b> Breast Cancer <br /><b>Age diagnosed:</b> 35 </p><p><b>Guard your loins</b><br />Treatments like radiation and chemotherapy can throw a young woman into early menopause--a big concern among patients of childbearing age. Yet oncologists don't always mention it or discuss alternatives. When Michele Kerher's marriage ended, in the fall of 2007, the Chicago physical therapist, then 35, back-burnered plans for kids. ""I figured I still had time to get remarried and start a family,"" she says. </p><p>But three weeks after her separation, Michele was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer that had already begun to spread to her lymph nodes. She was shocked to learn that the plan her doctor suggested (a lumpectomy and removal of some of her lymph nodes plus 12 weeks of chemo) could destroy her eggs. ""My doctor didn't mention it,"" she says. ""A friend tagged along to an appointment and asked, 'What about Michele's fertility?' It was like an afterthought to him."" </p><p>So before beginning chemo, Michele started the process of <a target=""_blank"" href=""/health/protect-your-fertility"">storing her eggs: injecting herself with hormones</a> to put her ovaries into overdrive for a month, then having the dozen eggs she produced extracted and frozen. (The procedure is not covered by insurance.) Her periods resumed after her chemo ended, but she doesn't know if her eggs are intact. ""I'm glad I took the precaution,"" she says. </p><p>Michele's experience is typical. Studies show that as few as half of childbearing-age women are advised about fertility before treatment. That may change. In 2006 the American Society of Clinical Oncology published guidelines for addressing fertility options with patients. And more treatments are being developed that can KO cancer without harming your chances at pregnancy. Just 10 years ago, the typical treatment for cervical cancer was a complete hysterectomy. But a new procedure, radical trachelectomy, leaves enough of the cervix behind for women to conceive, carry a fetus, and deliver. </p><p><b>Jodi Cooper</b><br /><b>Occupation:</b> Real estate developer <br /><b>Home:</b> Los Angeles, CA<br /><b>Type of cancer:</b> Breast<br /><b>Age diagnosed:</b> 31 </p><p><b>Find a program designed for you</b><br />Mainstream cancer centers tend to be filled with very young patients (like Lego-loving third-graders) or very old ones (think retirement-community residents). When you're the only one with a busy social life or a preschooler at home, it can be hard to find support. </p><p>When a physical turned up a lump in Jodi Cooper's breast in 2005, her biggest hurdle was psychological. She worried about how the treatment--a lumpectomy followed by aggressive chemo and seven weeks of radiation--would affect her appearance and social life. ""Losing my hair was the worst part,"" the 34-year-old Los Angeles resident says. ""I thought, 'Who would want to date a bald woman who has cancer?'"" </p><p>As one of the youngest patients at her treatment facility, Jodi also felt socially isolated. She recalls an 84-year-old in the waiting room who tried to console her by saying, ""I know how you feel."" </p><p>""I thought, 'You have no idea how I feel!'"" Jodi says. ""She was married, had adult children, and had lived a full life. I wanted to meet someone and have kids, and had just learned I might go into menopause after treatment. I felt like damaged goods."" </p><p>At the time, her doctors didn't know of any support groups for young adults. But after her treatment ended, Jodi tracked down other young women with cancer and offered her support. ""I sat with them during chemo sessions,"" she says. ""I wanted them to have what I didn't: the knowledge that they were not alone."" Later, a family member told her about Imerman Angels, a group geared toward young adults who are cancer fighters, survivors, and caregivers. (For more on this and other support groups for young adults, see ""Start Talking,"" page 64.) </p><p>Finding a treatment center designed for young adults can also make a difference in your recovery. There are about 10 such facilities in the U.S., including the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, the Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology Program at the Oregon Health and Science University Cancer Institute in Portland, and the Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Center at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. ""Compared with older adults, people in their twenties and thirties may metabolize chemotherapy drugs faster or have a better tolerance for higher doses, which would have an impact on the course of treatment,"" Hayes-Lattin says. On the other hand, there's evidence that chemo may weaken the heart, making younger patients more susceptible to long-term cardio risks that someone in her sixties wouldn't live long enough to need to worry about. Doctors familiar with these risks can recommend follow-ups with a cardiologist. These centers also focus on lifestyle issues unique to young adults, including access to fertility experts and genetic counselors. </p><p>After receiving treatment in Baltimore, Bridget is back at Dana-Farber. ""Being here makes me feel normal. We talk about cancer, sure, but we also talk to each other about dating and writing a resume,"" she says.

But if you're relying on the lotion (or spray, or stick) to safeguard your skin from the cancer-causing effects of UV rays, then we need to fill you in on some crucial info. A new study from the journal <em>Nature</em> found that sunscreen alone, even a high-number SPF, isn't a guarantee that you won't at some point develop melanoma, the rarest yet deadliest form of skin cancer.</p><p>Researchers applied sunscreen with an SPF of 50 to mice who were bred to be predisposed to melanoma. Compared to a group of mice sans sunscreen, the first group took 30 percent longer to develop melanoma. The takeaway: Though high-factor sunscreen helped reduce the damage UV rays do to skin cells on a molecular level, which in turn can lead to cancer, it wasn't enough to offer complete protection, researchers concluded.</p><p>That comes as no surprise to dermatologists, who have long reminded patients that protecting your skin also means having other weapons in your cancer-fighting arsenal, says New York City dermatologist Albert Lefkovits, M.D., associate clinical professor of dermatology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. That includes covering up with clothes or a broad-brimmed hat, staying under an umbrella or awning, and totally avoiding being outside during peak UV hours between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Sure you've heard these strategies before, but combined with regular use of a broad-spectrum sunscreen (meaning it repels UVA and UVB rays) of at least 30 SPF, they really will keep your skin healthy.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/cancer-risk-after-skin-cancer"">Skin Cancer May Increase Your Risk of OTHER Cancers</a></p><p>The other thing to know about melanoma is that unlike basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma-two more common, less lethal forms of skin cancer that are almost always caused by unprotected sun exposure-melanoma can appear on places on the body where, well, the sun doesn't shine, such as your butt, pubic area, and the bottoms of your feet, says Lefkovits. This suggests that melanoma is caused by other factors, like genetics, and bathing yourself in sunscreen may not even make a difference. In fact, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.epa.gov/sunwise/doc/sunscreen.pdf"">the Environmental Protection Agency</a>notes that there is no evidence that sunscreen protects against malignant melanoma like it protects against other types of skin cancer (like basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma). So even though this study was done on mice who were already more susceptible to melanoma, the results show that sunscreen alone may not prevent skin cancer, especially if you have a genetic predisposition for the disease.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/naked-photo-shoot"">I Did a Naked Photo Shoot-For My Health</a></p><p>Of course, this doesn't mean you should toss your SPF. Broad-spectrum sunscreens are still highly recommended as they protect against cancer-causing UVA and UVB rays. According to the researchers, a combination of sunscreen and careful covering up will reduce your risk of skin cancer. To fully protect against melanoma, it's important to go for yearly skin checks and have any weird spot or mark checked out ASAP so you can catch a growth before it becomes malignant, says Lefkovits.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/skin-cancer-risk"">What's Your Skin Cancer Risk?</a></p>","cancer,summer skin"

But be genuine: Steer away from embarrassingly overt gushing (""I don't know how you do it all!"") and compliment in detail (""You really nailed it with that Capote quote during the presentation. The client ate it up."").<br /><br /><b>The Loud Talker</b><br /><br /><b>CONFRONT!</b> She speaks at volumes only warranted for a Hoobastank concert. Rather than let your productivity (and sanity) suffer, take the batteries out of this megaphone. An e-mail is easy but risky. ""All you're sending are words, which, devoid of tone and body language, can be misinterpreted and cause hard feelings,"" says Richard Hader, Ph.D., a workplace consultant at Meridian Health in New Jersey. Next time she's ordering low-rise Rio thongs from Victoria's Secret, tell her you enjoy working closely with her but need to make a deadline and need it to be quieter. That way, it comes off as more of a request than a reprimand.<br /><br /><b>The Queen Bee-yatch</b><br /><br /><b>IGNORE!</b> Photocopying and finding coffee filters aren't part of your job description, but she seems to think so. Be confident in the fact that while she thinks she's high and mighty, she's the only one. A recent University of Florida study showed that supervisors and coworkers think very little of self-absorbed employees who have inflated egos about their job skills. Eventually a superior will notice her misguided power trip and take her down a notch. In the meantime ask for her opinion on something to tame her defensiveness and aggressiveness. ""She may reduce the obnoxious bragging and bossiness if she thinks you respect her knowledge,"" says Bev Smallwood, Ph.D., a psychologist and workplace consultant.<br /><br /><b>The Sex Kitten</b><br /><br /><b>IGNORE!</b> If her clingy, low V-neck sweater caught your eye during the meeting, then it probably caught the eyes of the entire male staff, too. These daily peep shows can make you wonder whether she's going to be favored over you and land more plum assignments. Relax; you're more of a threat than she is. A recent Tulane University study found that women who had tried flirtatious behavior at work (such as wearing short skirts, massaging a man's shoulders, or sending racy e-mails) got fewer pay raises and promotions than those who did not. Those who maintained a professional appearance received an average of three more promotions - earning up to $100,000 a year to the tart's $75,000. ""Inappropriate dress will detract from her professionalism and credibility,"" Dr. Smallwood says. ""It won't send her up the ladder unless they want to look up her dress.""<br /><br /><b>The Sniper</b><br /><br /><b>CONFRONT!</b> She's great to your face, nasty behind your back. Most people in the corporate world choose to let things fester rather than say something to passive-aggressive coworkers, according to a recent poll. ""People want to get along with everyone, so they feel uncomfortable revealing that they're upset or in disagreement,"" says Rick Brinkman, N.D., author of <i>Dealing with People You Can't Stand</i>. If you sense she's got an issue with you, suggest the two of you go to lunch or grab a coffee. ""Preface your discussion by reassuring her that there will be no relationship consequences whatsoever for being honest,"" Dr. Brinkman says. Then tackle the issue and put an end to the trash talk.<br /><br /><b>The Daily Tabloid</b><br /><br /><b>IGNORE!</b> She knows who got fired, who's getting fired, and starts rumors about who should get fired. And she insists on planting herself in your office to fill you in. Other coworkers might think you're in cahoots, so you need to artfully blow her off without giving her any new material. Next time she tries to engage you in sleaze talk, let her down gently with one of these lines: ""I guess we'll find out, won't we?"" or ""I'm sorry, I really do have to hop on this conference call,"" suggests Sherron Bienvenu, Ph.D., a communications consultant and author of <i>Just Talking</i>. These dead-end sentences convey that you don't really care about the district manager's marital problems. She'll take the hint and bring her Enquirer reports elsewhere.<br /><br /><b>The Yes Man</b><br /><br /><b>CONFRONT!</b> He's always taking on more than he should, and since he's on your team, guess who gets to pick up the slack when he hits overload. Poor task managers need babysitters. Pop by his desk several times before a project is due and say, ""Hey, how's it going? Just checking in on that end-of-the-year report."" This probably won't change his tendency to take on too much, but it'll keep the stuff you're involved with at the front end of his assembly line, Dr. Brinkman says.<br /><br /><b>The Playboy</b><br /><br /><b>CONFRONT!</b> You know you look pretty damn good today, but you don't need someone with a Jenna Jameson screensaver to tell you that. Well, you're not the only one dodging comments better suited for a bar than the boardroom: 81 percent of women have dealt with an overtly flirtatious male coworker, and 92 percent of male managers admitted to lusting after female colleagues, according to a recent poll. The solution: Put Don Juan in the hot seat. If he mumbles something flirty, ask him in a neutral tone, ""What did you just say?"" The question forces him to reassess his behavior without presuming the worst, says Judith Selee McClure, Ph.D., author of <i>Civilized Assertiveness for Women</i>. If he still doesn't get it, calmly state, ""I just don't like that,"" and cut off all friendly contact. We're sure he and Jenna will be very happy together.<br /><br />Content provided by WORKS by Nicole Williams: the destination brand for professional women.<br /><br />WORKS is dedicated to helping women achieve success in every aspect of their lives.

Sales of little containers of ""energy"" drinks such as Rockstar Energy Shot are soaring and are expected to reach $700 million this year. These liquid boosters contain a blend of ingredients such as caffeine, amino acids, and B vitamins, and sometimes a dash of an herbal stimulant such as guarana or ginseng. At an itty-bitty two ounces and strategically placed next to cash registers, they're meant to entice cramming college students and late-night drivers-and they do. But is their promise to pump you up too good to be true?<br /><br />The ingredients may jump-start your engine, but what really does the trick is the caffeine, says Mark Kantor, Ph.D., associate professor of nutrition and food science at the University of Maryland. It can be as much as you'd get in a 16-ounce cup of coffee. The rest are nutrients you most likely get enough of in your diet, especially the B vitamins, says Leslie Bonci, R.D., the director of sports medicine nutrition at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.<br /><br />The main selling point is that you can get it all in one low-calorie gulp (most of the drinks have only 5 to 30 calories), so no more plowing through an entire 110-calorie, 8.3-ounce Red Bull, or a large latte, to get revved up. But keep in mind that the word energy is misleading, Bonci says. You're running on caffeine, not actual fuel (read: real food!), which is what your body needs to get powered up. ""These drinks are just a stimulant,"" she says.<br /><br />As long as you don't overdo it, there's no real danger-aside from a cough syrupy taste. Limit yourself to one shot a day, and never drink more than one at a time or you'll risk getting jittery.<br /></p>","energy,Career Center"
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/yoga/how-yoga-helps-with-weight-loss,Yoga,28,17,14,1,0,0,0,0,,Lose Weight with Yoga,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/yoga-add-yoga.jpg,"<p>Regularly touted for its <a href=""/health/tips-to-stress-less"">stress-reduction</a> prowess, yoga's potential to reduce that other common undesirable (weight) gets forgotten. ""Yoga works on so many levels for weight loss,"" says Aruni Nan Futuronsky, director of the Integrative Weight Loss program at the Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health in Lenox, Massachusetts. ""Most important, it teaches you to pay attention to your body and respect it, which leads to the desire to care for it properly-and that includes giving it the proper nutrition."" It also reduces stress and <a href=""/health/sleep-problems-and-sleep-solutions"">improves sleep</a>, which cuts back on the mindless, one-chip-after-another eating that anxiety or exhaustion tend to encourage.</p><p>To start slimming down, Futuronsky and Steve Hartman, director of professional training at Kripalu, recommend incorporating these activities into your week.</p><p><b>1. Do gentle poses.</b> Because yoga is more about getting back into your skin and listening to your body than it is about burning calories, there's no need to kill yourself with super-hard yoga classes-unless that happens to be something you enjoy. It's much better to do a class that feels comfortable than one that pushes you so hard you don't want to work out the next day. And there's also no need to do the same type or amount of yoga every day. If all you have time for is a single <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/sun-salutation-poses""><b>sun salutation (surya namaskara)</b></a>, that's fine. But doing a little something every day is the best way to form a healthy habit. </p><p><b>2. Take a breath break.</b> ""Deep breathing oxygenates the body and stimulates the immune system, which, in turn, increases the metabolism and releases feel-good endorphins into the system,"" Hartman says. That extra oxygen helps our bodies process nutrients more quickly. Stop everything once a day and try this crazy breathing exercise-preferably when you don't worry about your appearance. You stand forewarned, it makes you look absolutely crackers.</p><p><b>Twisting <i>hara</i> breath </b><br /><i>This exercise stimulates the metabolism and stretches and relaxes the spine. </i><br />Stand with feet a little wider than your hips, arms at your sides. Begin to rotate your hips and shoulders from side to side, allowing your relaxed arms to flop around and slap your shoulders like empty shirtsleeves. Let your head follow by looking over one shoulder and then the other. Exhale through your mouth as you twist; and inhale through your nose as you come back to center. After 10 to 20 seconds, slow your twisting to a stop. You should feel tingly and energized.</p><p><b>3. Eat like a monk.</b> It doesn't matter if it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner, just pick a single meal once a week and eat it alone in complete silence. Focus all of your attention on how each bite looks and smells, and how your body feels as you slowly chew, swallow, and digest. See if you can pick up on the signals your body sends when it's had enough. What does it feel like to stop eating when you first start feeling full? What does it feel like when you overeat? Do you enjoy your food more when you eat slowly or when you eat quickly? How do different foods make you feel? The answers will help you make your own decisions about eating better. </p><p><b>4. Do 15-minutes of anti-activity whenever you need it.</b> Never underestimate the effect of stress on your diet. Too many hectic days in a row can turn even the healthiest, most disciplined person into a pizza-inhaling, beer-guzzling Chris Farley. Stop that from happening to you by creating a mental menu of relaxing activities that you can do on the spot with little, to no, preparation-taking a hot shower with a Beth Orton CD blasting, reading a beloved short story for the zillionth time, lying down on the living room carpet and watching a fish mobile spin around and around-and do it whenever you could use some distance from all of your responsibilities and obligations. Need inspiration? Light a candle, sit down, and focus on the flame. Notice how its shape is constantly changing, how it's composed of different colors, how it interacts with the wick. For a few brief moments, just hang out and contemplate that little bit of light.</p>","Fix It,Calm,Best Yoga For..."

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/cheating-in-a-marriage,Sex And Relationships,7,17,7,1,1,1,1,0,,Newlywed Cheating On the Rise,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0904-couple-dancing-bw.jpg,"<p>""I thought I'd gotten other women out of my system, but after a year-long engagement, and then a year of marriage, I was cheating again."" To hear John, * 28, a pharmaceutical rep from New Jersey, talk about straying so soon after tying the knot, you might assume he's a heartless, hormone-fueled aberration. In reality, he's part of a growing trend: newlyweds who cheat. </p><p>""As surprising as it is, <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/woman-who-cheat"">adultery</a> is very common during the first year of marriage,"" says Bonnie Eaker Weil, Ph.D., author of <i>Adultery: The Forgivable Sin</i>. Last year, researchers at the University of Washington Center for the Study of Health and Risk Behaviors who analyzed data on infidelity taken from the General Social Survey found that roughly 20 percent of men and 15 percent of women under age 35 copped to having <a href=""/sex-and-relationships"">sexual relationships</a> outside of their marriage in 2006 (the latest figures available), up from 15 and 12 percent, respectively, 15 years earlier.</p><p>What gives? Part of the problem, says David Popenoe, Ph.D., founder and codirector of the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University, is that we've become an anything-goes society, in which the indiscretions of politicians, sports figures, and pop celebrities are practically daily news. </p><p>Also, ""newlyweds have this sense about cheating that if you're going to do it, do it now,"" says M. Gary Neuman, an infidelity expert and author of <i>The Truth About Cheating</i>. ""Men may feel that if the <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/avoid-an-unhappy-marraige"">marriage</a> was a mistake, it's better to figure it out before things get even more entangled with kids and families."" And no doubt while their wives are least likely to be suspicious.<br />But there are ways to protect your young marriage. The key is to be proactive-don't assume that uttering ""I do"" ensures fidelity. Here are the top reasons experts say why men cheat early on, and how you can take action to make sure your guy doesn't.</p><p><b>Reason No. 1<br />You've played house for years</b><br />Time was, being a newlywed meant finally getting to share a roof. Not so today. More couples than ever are shacking up-6.4 million in 2007, compared with fewer than 1 million 30 years ago, according to the Census Bureau. Add the time you've lived together to the average 17-month engagement, and it's a good bet the attraction is less electric by the time you walk down the aisle.</p><p>Research shows that infidelity rates are much higher among cohabiting couples than married folks who don't live together first. One possible reason: ""Often, a couple that decides to live together isn't as committed,"" Popenoe says. And if that's the attitude, he adds, it doesn't necessarily change just because you get married. The possible result: In fairly short order, one of you-most likely him-is on the prowl.</p><p><b>How to cheat-proof your love</b>: If you do decide to live together, Popenoe says, don't use it as a trial for marriage. That mindset ""is almost the opposite of the one you need to have if you want a long-term commitment: Let's see if this works, and if it doesn't we can get out easily."" If your guy's got a history of serial monogamy, the risk escalates: ""After a whole series of relationships like that, it's very difficult to jump into one where you've got to work everything out and can't run away,"" Popenoe says. And if a guy feels trapped, an affair can seem like an easy way out. </p><p><b>Reason No. 2 <br />The web makes cheating easy</b><br />It's simpler than ever to find an affair online-and the people searching for one are not always those you'd suspect. Of the 3.3 million users of AshleyMadison.com, a dating site that unapologetically caters to married people looking to stray, about 500,000 are newlyweds, according to the site's president, Noel Biderman.</p><p>Even if a person doesn't go online specifically to troll for a dalliance, the very nature of the Internet can be the start of a slippery slope toward infidelity. First, there's the easy access to pornography: The University of Washington data found that men under age 35 were two and a quarter times more likely to have cheated if they had seen an X-rated movie. ""Consumption of pornography might lead to increases in specific types of sexual behaviors, including anonymous sex,"" says James Furrow, Ph.D., a co-author of the study and the Freed chair of marital and family therapy at the Fuller Theological Seminary School of Psychology. </p><p>Then there are sites like Facebook, where anyone from exes to one-night stands can find you. What starts as innocent e-flirting (which 20 percent of adults who used social-networking sites in 2008 admitted to in a study by the Pew Internet and American Life Project) can quickly get out of hand. </p><p>Mark, 28, a financial analyst from Connecticut, began using online dating sites when he was single and hasn't stopped, even though he got married in 2004. At first he just chatted online, but eventually he started arranging dates in cities he traveled to for work. He had his first fling within 16 months of his wedding and has racked up four more since then-none with anyone from his hometown. ""The feeling of having e-mails from women across the country in your inbox is exciting,"" he admits.</p><p><b>How to cheat-proof your love:</b> Not every guy with an e-mail account is going to stray, and checking your man's browser history will only show you don't trust him. It's important to remember that most men who use the Internet to have an affair are looking for sex, not intimacy, says Mary Jo Rapini, a psychotherapist at Methodist Hospital in Houston who specializes in sex and intimacy issues. Given that, Rapini advises circumventing the temptation by watching a steamy flick or even some light porn with your hubby. ""You're taking away the sneaking-around element and instead enjoying it together,"" she says. ""And that usually ends up turning you both on.""</p><p><b>Reason No. 3 <br />Marriage hits guys harder</b><br />Compared with dating and an engagement, marriage is serious business. It can seem like a drag, especially to men. ""They feel this sudden responsibility to be a good provider and a good husband,"" says Terri Orbuch, Ph.D., a marriage therapist and research professor at the University of Michigan. ""These expectations can make young men feel old and boring.""</p><p>Ruth Houston, author of <i>Is He Cheating on You? 829 Telltale Signs</i> and founder of<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.infidelityadvice.com"">infidelityadvice.com</a>, has conducted more than 10,000 interviews with cheaters and says: ""Men want to recapture how they felt when they were dating, and if they can't do it with their wives, they'll look elsewhere.""</p><p><b>How to cheat-proof your love:</b> Since the early stages of marriage can be a vulnerable time for him, get vocal about how much you appreciate him-both as a husband and as the smokin'-hot guy you fell in love with. Thank him when he cleans the bathroom and remind him that he's sexy, smart, and cracks you up. ""Re-creating the excitement you once had can actually boost dopamine and oxytocin, two brain chemicals responsible for that love rush,"" Weil says. So indulge in the occasional spontaneous road trip or lunchtime quickie so that your passion can thrive within the marriage, not outside it.</p><p><b>Reason No. 4 <br />The sex has gotten stale</b><br />""It's not necessarily that the frequency of sex declines in that first year, but some of the passion dies down,"" Orbuch says.</p><p>That was the case for Doug, a 33-year-old teacher in Texas who dated his wife for two years before marrying her. When their sex life ran dry a little over a year into the marriage, he started sleeping with an ex-girlfriend. ""I felt like I needed it,"" he says.</p><p>Part of the problem in cases like Doug's: ""While all the companionship and familiarity of marriage makes a couple closer, it can kill the fire in the bedroom,"" says Patti Britton, Ph.D., author of The Art of Sex Coaching. A few years ago a German study found that women's libidos steadily decreased while they were in a secure relationship, while men's drives stayed the same.</p><p><b>How to cheat-proof your love:</b> Talk it out, Weil advises. ""Make sex a priority and resolve to have it at least a few times a week."" Consider coming up with your own personal ""sex vows"": I promise not to have a headache for more than three consecutive nights. I promise I'll be open to trying new things in bed, and so on.</p><p>That doesn't mean you have to tackle the Kama Sutra every time you knock boots. In studying men who cheat, Neuman found that those who were dissatisfied with their marital sex lives preferred quantity over quality. ""A man would rather have basic sex a few times a week than swinging-from-the-chandeliers sex every once in a while,"" he says. That's not to say you should shelve the acrobatics and lingerie-just agree to get it on more often, with or without props.</p><p><b>Reason No. 5 <br />Marriage didn't fix him</b><br />You'd think that commitment-phobes would avoid the altar, but often they go through with marriage thinking that it will ""cure"" them. When it doesn't, they feel stuck.</p><p>""People who have cheated in the past usually can't handle being so close with one person. But that's exactly what happens in that first year of marriage-you get closer, you plan for the future, you focus on the togetherness and the partnership,"" Weil says. ""So someone with commitment issues might feel even more trapped, and be more compelled to cheat, using another person as an intimacy blocker to keep themselves from getting too close to their spouse.""</p><p>John, the pharmaceutical rep who cheated after having been married for a year, says he had always cheated on his girlfriends. ""I honestly think it's just the way I'm wired, like a lot of guys."" </p><p><b>How to cheat-proof your love:</b> Your best bet is not marrying a guy who's at high risk for straying. In addition to our checklist (<a target=""_self"" href=""/sex-and-relationships/cheating-in-a-marriage?page=3"">next page</a>), Houston offers these warning signs: an extremely active sex life, a lot of female friends, a lot of male friends who cheat, and parents (a mother or father) who cheated.</p><p><i>*Names and details have been changed to protect the sources' anonymity.</i></p><p></p><p><b>Will He Cheat?</b><br />Before you take your vows, scan this surprising list. The more items you can check off, the less likely he is to be checking into a hotel with someone who's not you.</p><p><b>He doesn't hide his animal lust</b><br />If he openly drools over your best friend's lower-back tattoo, laugh it off. It's when you find a photo of said tat on his camera phone that you need to worry. ""In every relationship, people window-shop,"" says <i>WH</i> advisor Yvonne K. Fulbright, Ph.D., a certified sex educator and the president of Sexuality Source in Washington, D.C. ""But trying to hide it means he might be thinking about acting on those urges.""</p><p><b>You're his better-looking half</b><br />Unattractive men might cheat too, but according to a study published last year in the <i>Journal of Family Psychology</i>, your chances of marital bliss are better if you're the beauty and he's the beast. Of the 82 newlywed couples surveyed, those in which the bride was easier on the eyes reported the most satisfaction.</p><p><b>He cries at sappy movies</b><br />Sure, few guys besides Dr. Phil talk much about their emotions. But if he consistently avoids heartfelt conversations, heed the signs. A 2008 study from the University of Montreal discovered that the more emotionally detached your partner is, the more likely he is to cheat. ""That's because habitual cheaters only care about themselves,"" says sex therapist Gloria Brame. </p><p><b>You don't always agree</b><br />No two people see eye-to-eye all the time, so if a couple never fights, it usually means one of them is suppressing feelings that can build into resentments they'll use later to justify straying, says couples psychologist Don-David Lusterman, Ph.D. ""Being challenged can be an aphrodisiac,"" he says. Not to mention that make-up sex is always worth it.</p><p><b>He goes to church</b><br />If you want him to worship you, research shows, it's better if he worships, period. A study published last year in the <i>Journal of Marriage and Family</i> found that regular churchgoers were less likely to have affairs, regardless of their faith. </p><p><b>He's got a small...paycheck </b><br />An <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.msnbc.com"">msnbc.com</a> survey found that more men earning $300,000 or more a year admitted cheating than those who earned less than $35,000. </p>",perfect skin

I'm crouching in the corner of a dark room alongside 49 other would-be <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/volunteer-to-become-a-firefighter"">volunteer firefighters</a>. All the outside doors and windows in the house have been bolted shut. The only things I can hear are my own breathing and an ominous crackling as the fire builds to a roar. Twenty feet away, orange and yellow flames reach to the ceiling, briefly illuminating the room. Then there's smoke -- first white, then gray, then pitch-black -- that blocks out the ceiling and begins to descend, dropping lower and lower. The heat becomes almost unbearable, and I can feel the sweat trickling down my chest beneath my coat.<br /><br />Our instructor tells us to take off a glove and raise that hand to find out why you never, <i>ever</i> stand up in <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/survival-tips"">a fire</a>. Down by the ground it's a stifling 200 degrees, but just 18 inches above our heads the temperature rises to 400. I jerk my fingers back down. The smoke is now so thick I can see only inches in front of my face. Keeping one hand on the wall, I follow the other trainees along the perimeter of the room. Finally the door opens; we stumble outside and gasp in the fresh air.<br /><br />I had no idea what I was getting into when I decided to become a volunteer firefighter in this small town on Fire Island, off New York's Long Island, where my husband spent his summers growing up and where we spend as much of every summer as possible. The first part of the training program consisted of a series of 4-hour Saturday-morning classes and a dozen or so drills involving hoses and hydrants. It wasn't until I arrived at the Suffolk County Fire Academy for 4 days of hands-on exercises that the penny dropped: They were expecting me -- a 41-year-old fashion editor with two kids -- to climb ladders, ax my way though windows, enter burning buildings, and search for ""bodies"" (aka dummies). I seriously considered giving up then and there. But I had my reasons for staying.<br /><br />The main one involved a horrible run-in between a truck and a cyclist in downtown Manhattan last June. As my husband and I were walking, I heard the crunch as a tire rolled over the guy's body. After dialing 911 and being transferred from one operator to the next, I started crying out of pure frustration -- I was standing right next to a dying person, and I couldn't do anything to help. If I'd known just a few emergency procedures, maybe I wouldn't have been so useless.<br /><br />Being so close to a real fire scared the hell out of me, but it was amazing how knowing the rules -- stay down, keep close to the wall, locate the exit -- kept me calm and focused. The only time I felt a surge of panic was when a partner and I were supposed to simulate rescuing an injured firefighter from a basement while blindfolded and breathing from oxygen tanks strapped to our backs. We circled the room, sweeping the floor until we located the body. It was a heavy, floppy, fully clothed mannequin also wearing a tank. I grasped the dummy under the armpits and waited for my partner to secure its legs in a harness, but he was having trouble. The body was too heavy for me to lift myself, so there was nothing I could do but wait.<br /><br />The same feeling of frustrated helplessness that I'd experienced that day in the city washed over me again, and I felt my heart rate rise and my breathing become choppy. Why did I think I could do this? I forced myself to breathe more slowly. After another few minutes, my partner yelled that the body was secure, and we moved ahead, still bent in a back-straining crouch.<br /><br />When we finally laid the body on the ground, I stood up and felt something stronger than relief. Dragging that body to safety gave me a sense of mental and physical ability that filled me with confidence. I may never be on the front lines of a raging fire, but when the time comes that someone needs me again -- whether it's one of my children, a neighbor, or a total stranger -- I'll be able to do more than just dial 911.<br /><br /><i>-- With Nicole Beland</i><br />",Woman to Woman

But according to the Families and Work Institute, 81 percent of companies are maintaining their flexible workplace options (including compressed workweeks, telecommuting, and voluntarily reduced hours), and 13 percent are actually increasing these options during the recession.<br /><br />Here's how to leverage this altered employment atmosphere to get the life you crave.</p><p><strong>Pinpoint Your Priorities</strong><br />Although it may be a good time to request some flexibility at work, don't be greedy. Map out one-yes, one-specific request in your head, whether it's working from home once a week or leaving the office at a certain time every night. The next step: Find out if anyone at the company has the kind of deal you're dreaming of by asking around and talking to your supervisor or someone in the human resources department. ""Many companies don't communicate their flex options, so it's your responsibility to investigate,"" explains Kyra Cavanaugh, president of Life Meets Work, a consultancy and online resource. </p><p><strong>Gauge Your Manager</strong><br />A boss who arrives at work around the same time the sun rises, or clocks out at midnight, might not be open to reducing your hours. This is why you need to figure out exactly what's in it for her. ""What can you do to make your manager look good or lighten her load?"" asks Ellen McGrath, Ph.D., a clinical professor at New York University and director of NYU's Program for Social Ventures. For example, you could take on a project she doesn't want to handle, train new employees, or offer to help a junior colleague she doesn't have time to oversee. This conversation takes courage-no one wants to create waves at work. Adds McGrath: ""It has always been especially difficult for women to speak up about what they want or need because we're conditioned to please."" But if seeking a more balanced life is truly important to you, muster up the nerve to make your request...and proceed with caution. </p><p><strong>Create a Plan</strong><br />Draw up an organized proposal, detailing exactly the type of arrangement you want, how you'll manage it (when you'll be working on-site versus off, how you'll adjust your schedule as needed, whether you're willing to accept a pay cut), and how this will benefit the company. For example, maybe by shifting your hours, you'll be available to customers who need help when your colleagues aren't there, or by working from home part-time, you'll have uninterrupted productivity. And be sure your boss knows there won't be a reduction in the quality or quantity of your work. But beware: ""The more personally motivated your request, the more likely your boss will doubt its legitimacy,"" Cavanaugh says. </p><p><strong>Beat Your Boss to the Punch</strong><br />Anticipate any potential roadblocks and troubleshoot them in advance. ""You know the adage 'Don't go to your boss with a problem unless you have a solution'? That's the approach to take,"" says Lisa Mainiero, Ph.D., a professor of management at Fairfield University in Connecticut. So draw up a list. This way, you won't feel stumped for answers when she challenges you with a flurry of what-ifs. </p><p><strong>Capitalize on Your Success</strong><br />Does your boss love you? That's good news. Top performers are in prime position to receive flextime. ""Valued employees have more leverage in these conversations, because companies don't want their most talented people to leave when the recession ebbs,"" Cavanaugh says. So be prepared to spout your biggest successes and the highlights of your positive performance reviews, and find a way to do it without sounding like an entitled egomaniac. The goal is to persuade her by proving that you consistently produce excellent work, independently or as part of a team.</p><p><strong>Put a Firm Foot Forward</strong><br />If you encounter resistance, don't wuss out or get upset, and definitely don't tear up. Instead, suggest giving the arrangement a try for a month or two; it's possible that she's not open to the idea simply because she fears the unknown. But if it's clear she won't budge, it's best to let go of the issue. You can always revisit the subject at a later date, or start looking for a new job that makes you feel less shackled.</p>",work

Everyone needs a healthy lunch!<p></p><p>Skipping, skimping, or overindulging during lunchtime can lead you down a dangerous path for the rest of the day. Not eating anything causes blood sugar levels to drop, which sends energy packing, while eating like a bird drives your stomach wild and causes intense cravings later in the day, says Susan Bowerman, a board-certified specialist in sports dietetics.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/heart-health,Health,5,16,0,3,1,1,0,0,,Prevent heart disease in women,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1109-heart-health_1.jpg,"<p>Your heart is one impressive, overachieving organ: In the minute it takes you to read these paragraphs, it will have pushed a whopping 1.5 gallons of blood through 60,000 miles of blood vessels-that's more than twice the circumference of Earth. Yet despite your ticker's superpowers (and the fact that it keeps you, well, alive), most women don't do enough to safeguard their heart health.<br /><br />That's right, we're talking to you. Heart disease is the number one killer of all women, says health advocate and former U.S. surgeon general Richard Carmona, M.D.<br /><br />""It can and does affect young people,"" he stresses. In other words, it's not just a problem for geezers. The following are simple lifestyle tweaks that can help you live a long, healthy life.</p><p><strong>Have More Sex</strong><br />Getting busy at least twice a week can reduce your risk for heart disease by lowering blood pressure and reducing stress, says ob-gyn Andrew Scheinfeld, M.D., a clinical instructor at New York University Langone Medical Center. You'll still be helping your heart even if you never reach the Big O; researchers suspect that just being aroused can trigger your brain to release hormones such as dehydro-epiandrosterone (DHEA), which may improve circulatory-system function and boost cardiac performance. </p><p>No partner? No worries. ""I encourage my patients to take matters into their own hands,"" says Scheinfeld. And science backs him up. Numerous studies show that women who experience increased sexual frequency and satisfaction-with a mate or on their own-have a greater resistance to heart disease.</p><p><strong>Drink Wine with Dinner</strong><br />Yes, you read that right. In moderation, booze can actually benefit your heart. Drinking one-we repeat, one-glass of red or white wine a day can decrease the chance of dying from heart disease by 25 percent.</p><p><strong>Skip the Salt</strong><br />Despite conflicting headlines, you should still bypass most saltshakers, says cardiologist Ashley Simmons, M.D., of the University of Kansas Hospital. Your body counteracts sodium intake by releasing extra water into the blood, leading to increased blood volume and a seriously overworked heart.</p><p><strong>Snag Enough Sleep</strong><br />Frequently missing out on Z's can take a toll on your ticker in the form of high blood pressure, and we're not just talking about older folks. Nearly 20 percent of people from 24 to 32 years old already have the problem, which has few symptoms but can eventually lead to heart failure, according to a new study in the journal <em>Epidemiology</em>. Aim for around seven to eight hours of sleep a night, says Barbara Phillips, M.D., a professor of sleep medicine at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine.</p><p><strong>Get a Move On</strong><br />Consider this: On a minute-by-minute basis, your heart muscle labors twice as hard as your leg muscles during a sprint. And you have to work your heart out to keep it working. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes a week of moderate exercise (think brisk walking or cycling) or 75 minutes a week of vigorous exercise (i.e., cardio that's intense enough to make carrying on a conversation difficult), plus strength training at least twice a week. But the most important aspect of exercise is making it a habit. ""Time is not as important as frequency,"" says Scott Danberg, director of fitness at the Pritikin Longevity Center & Spa in Miami.</p><p><strong>Calm Your Mind</strong><br />Stress and heart disease go hand in hand, says Martha Gulati, M.D., director of women's cardiovascular health at Ohio State University. If you're constantly frazzled, your body's high levels of cortisol (a stress hormone) can lead to rapid heartbeat and high blood pressure, a potentially deadly combo. Too much cortisol can also damage arterial linings, making it harder for blood to deliver nutrients to your organs. </p><p>Knock down your stress level by hitting the mat: A recent study found that three months of biweekly yoga can help regulate both cortisol and irregular heart rate. Lauren Maher, a certified yoga therapist in Los Angeles, recommends starting with the uber-relaxing ""cat-cow"" pose: Get onto your hands and knees and slowly inhale while arching your back toward the ceiling; slowly exhale and round your back down toward the floor. Repeat for three minutes.</p><p><strong>Floss Every Day</strong><br />Gum disease doesn't just make for foul breath and a mangled smile-it's also murder on your heart. If you're breeding bacteria between your teeth, your immune system is on chronic high alert, a condition called inflammation that taxes your vital organs, including your heart. In fact, a woman's chance of having a heart attack may double if she has gum disease, according to the Academy of General Dentistry. </p><p>Flossing is the best way to banish dangerous oral bacteria, so whip out that string every night before brushing your teeth, says Mark Schlesinger, D.D.S., of the New York University College of Dentistry.</p>",

It kinda makes you wonder how these devilishly wise guys could have gotten it so wrong. Today yoga lovers are finding that more time on the mat means more-and steamier-time spent reveling in the pleasures of their tightly toned bodies without any of those tantric contortions you may have heard of. To take a walk on yoga's carnal side, add these easy moves to your routine. Or just do them by themselves to turn up the heat <a href=""/life/earth-friendly-bedroom"">in your bedroom</a>. </p><p><b>Bringing Flexy Back</b><br />Having more flexible muscles and joints definitely helps you assume those compromising positions and hold them comfortably too. Opening your hips in particular increases your range of motion in the nether regions, allowing for more direct <a href=""/yoga/yoga-for-better-sex-0"">stimulation</a> in just the right spots. After all, one micro-movement in missionary is sometimes all it takes to ring the bell.</p><p><b>Hot yoga:</b> <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/bound-angle-pose"">Bound angle pose (baddha konasana)</a> <br />In a seated position, bring the soles of your feet together and grab your ankles, allowing your knees to relax toward the floor. Then hinge forward from your hips as far as is comfortable, keeping your spine long and back flat. Hold for 10 to 15 slow breaths. </p><p><b>Perfect Your Pelvic Prowess</b><br />You've likely heard of Kegels and maybe your yoga teacher even talks about engaging your <i>mula bandha</i>-different terms for the same strengthening move that works one key muscle that increases your ability to engage and lift the pelvic floor. That brings you more control and sensation down there when you want it. </p><p><b>Hot yoga:</b> Root lock (mula bandha)<br />You can do this seated or standing by simply contracting and then releasing the muscle located between your pubic bone and tailbone, as if you wanted to stop the flow of urine. You can even do this at your desk, squeezing and releasing, say, 10 times, at three workday intervals, priming the pump for evening engagements. </p><p><b> Yogini Staying Power</b><br />Vigorous, shake-the-headboard sex is a strenuous workout. ""The better shape you are in, the more pleasure you have with sex and the longer you can do it,"" says Kimberly Fowler, owner and founder of Yoga and Spinning Studio in Venice, California.</p><p><b> Hot yoga:</b> Yoga pushups<br />Start in the <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/plank-pose"">plank position</a>, arms extended. Engage your abs as you lower your body slowly to <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/chaturanga-pose"">low pushup (chaturanga)</a>. Stop when your torso is about 2 to 3 inches away from the floor. Keep your elbows in, shoulders away from your ears, and collarbone broad, as you hold there for five breaths then lower to the floor. Repeat three times, building up to five.</p><p><b>Reboot to Knock Boots</b><br />A killer day at work can leave you too beat to boink. But a few minutes of nonstrenuous yoga when you get home can turn another night with Netflix into an erotic evening entwined with your mate.</p><p><b>Hot yoga:</b> <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/legs-up-the-wall-pose"">Legs-up-the-wall pose (viparita karani)</a> <br />Change into some yoga-friendly clothes and take 5 minutes for this pose. Lie on your back with one hip touching a wall, then swing your legs up and turn your body to face the wall. Rest your legs against it from heels to butt, arms at your side or alongside your ears. Bring your awareness to your breath and just follow it without changing it for 5 minutes. This position allows more oxygen-rich blood to flow from your lower body back up to the heart and the brain, so you'll get up reenergized, refocused, and ready to tumble.</p><p><b>Breath of Desire</b><br />While most poses simply help prepare you for a libidinous rendezvous, this breathing exercise can actually heighten your pleasure <i>in flagrante</i>. </p><p><b>Hot yoga: </b>Breath of fire (kapalabhati pranayama) <br />While you're getting busy, add rapid, forceful, and rhythmic breaths through the nose with the mouth closed. Don't worry if your partner thinks you're hyperventilating; he'll forget all about it when you reach a spine-tingling climax. </p><p><b>Double Your Pleasure<br /></b><br />If your man does yoga too, sex can improve exponentially. Practicing together is like foreplay, says Jacquie Noelle Greaux, creator of the <i>Better Sex Through Yoga</i> video. ""You start to breathe together, sweat together, and move together. It gets your energy synced up."" Some mat work just might make him more sex-imaginative as well. ""Yoga sparks creativity,"" Fowler says. ""[In bed], women don't want bang-boom from a man, they want an explorer-and yoga invites you to explore.""</p><p><b><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.genconnect.com/relationships/yoga-the-cure-for-better-sex/"">Read more about the link between yoga and better sex</a></b> (Via genConnect)</p>","Basics,Sequences & Workouts,Best Yoga For..."

Sure, we might crack wise about wishing for partners who were chronically adoring, relentlessly agreeable, and handy with a spatula. But the truth is, unless a guy watched too many <i>Leave It to Beaver</i> reruns as a kid, he wants a woman who's his intellectual and emotional equal. At least I wanted someone like that. </p><p>Or I thought I did. Until Black Thursday-otherwise known as the day that Allie and I made the big mistake of going rollerblading together. You see, what started out as a friendly challenge turned into a spirited race, and then into something else entirely. In short, Allie ended up leaving me in a trail of dust. And my male ego didn't like it. </p><p>The following Sunday, I was still ticked off. We were standing in her kitchen. I had done the dishes-that proved my postmodern feminist bona fides, right?-and I was silently (maybe too silently) arranging our bagels and lox on the table. </p><p>""Is there something you want to talk about?"" Allie asked. </p><p>""What do you mean?"" ""You've been acting weird ever since we went rollerblading."" </p><p>""As I already mentioned, I had a leg cramp. Plus, I was distracted because I was worried about a deadline,"" I said. </p><p>""I never make excuses when you beat me at thumb wrestling,"" my beloved pointed out. </p><p>""Which you do every time, because your hands are twice as big as mine. But I beat you at one thing, and you're a sulky 2-year-old."" </p><p>""I am not!"" ""Riiiiiight."" </p><p>""Plus, my wheels really need rotating."" </p><p>""Fact: I play your silly thumb-wrestling game because you like it, even though it's not an even a contest,"" Allie said. ""Fact: I beat you at rollerblading. Fact: You've been a jerk ever since."" </p><p>""Can we not discuss this?"" I shot back. Allie shook her head as I glared at my untouched but (if I do say so myself) perfectly prepared sesame bagel with lox and cream cheese. </p><p>""Steve,"" my wealthy, accomplished, and occasionally wise girlfriend said, ""maybe you ought to think about why getting beat by me drives you nuts."" </p><p>She had a point, of course. After all, wasn't I-a man dedicated to gender-neutral hiring practices and the wholesale shattering of glass ceilings-supposed to be beyond this? Wasn't I-a man who wanted an equal partner-supposed to celebrate my girlfriend's <a href=""/fitness/weight-lifting-for-women"">strength</a> and embrace her all-around awesomeness? Even when that awesomeness translated into athletic defeat for yours truly? </p><p>Well, yeah, I was supposed to. But I didn't. I wondered what the hell was the matter with me. Was I the product of evolutionary forces beyond my control, hardwired to become uneasy when the tables are turned and my girlfriend ascends-symbolically, professionally, or otherwise-to Alpha status, relegating me to (lowercase) beta? </p><p>The answer, I decided after some uncomfortable soul-searching, was simple: Every guy, no matter how crunchy, sensitive, or forward-thinking, has one area of his life in which he defines himself. That area often is also the one in which he is the most insecure. Investment bankers I know refuse to let dates pay for dinner. Movie-star marriages may break up when the wife starts getting juicier roles than the husband. Dating an accomplished doctor wasn't hard for me. Dating one who beat me, a lifelong jock, in an athletic competition? That was a different story. Whether this is evidence of an innate genetic drive or a sign that I am an emotional infant is unclear. What is clear is this: Once in a while, a guy likes to call the shots and, well, win. A guy also likes to be appreciated and needed. These desires are not unrelated. </p><p>So no matter how rich, successful, and generally Alpha you are, let us pick the restaurant from time to time, OK? Let us watch the Steelers game in peace, without telling us we're children. And when we're out walking and put our arm protectively around your shoulders, go with it. </p><p>That's not to say you should feign weakness or hide your strength. One of the things I love about Allie is how she tackles everything with gusto-even rollerblading. I just have to man up to it. </p><p>That's what I told her a week after Black Thursday. ""That's sweet,"" she said. ""And smart. I've always liked how sweet and smart you are."" </p><p>""Thanks, Doc,"" I said. ""I think you're pretty sweet and smart, too.""</p><p>""And I like how you're open with your feelings. You're handy in the kitchen.""</p><p>""Don't push it, Allie."" </p><p>""I'm teasing you. C'mon, you manly man-let's go to bed."" </p><p>""OK,"" I said. ""But first we're going to thumb wrestle.""</p>",Celebrities

But they deliver more than just a juicy burst of sweetness. Brightly colored power packs of nutrition, berries continually impress researchers with their ability to prevent disease and promote health. Although experts hesitate to say which berries are best - ""We're just scratching the surface of berries' health benefits,"" says American Dietetic Association spokesperson David Grotto, R.D. - check out the current contenders.<br /><br /><b>Blueberries</b><br /><br /><b>83 calories per cup</b><br />Loaded with free radical-fighting antioxidants - no other berry has more - blueberries are one of nature's best protectors against cancer and heart disease. They're brain food as well, says James Joseph, chief neuroscientist at the USDA's Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. ""They increase communication between neurons...and turn off oxidative stress and inflammation, which may promote Alzheimer's.""<br /><br /><b>Raspberries</b><br /><br /><b>64 calories per cup</b><br />Raspberries are a great source of ellagic acid, a potent killer of cancer cells in lab tests (though that power has not been proven in clinical trials). In fact, the lesser-known black raspberry has ""the highest number of cancer-preventing agents of any berry,"" says Ohio State University cancer prevention specialist Gary Stoner, Ph.D. Raspberries also have more fiber than any berry and most fruits, for that matter. <br /><br /><b>Blackberries</b><br /><br /><b>62 calories per cup</b><br />The darker the berry,the sweeter the juice - and the better for you. Blackberries, for instance, are loaded with anthocyanins, which are powerful antioxidants. How powerful? Research suggests that they not only help lower cholesterol and blood pressure but may also play a role in keeping diabetes, heart disease, and cancer at bay.<br /><br /><b>Strawberries</b><br /><br /><b>46 calories per cup</b><br />The nation's favorite, strawberries pack up to three times more vitamin C than other berries, and fewer calories, too. Snack on them for folic acid, a B vitamin that helps prevent birth defects, heart disease, and some cancers.<br />","healthy eating,Smart Shopping"

In front of an audience. I already feel sexy--I don't need a roomful of strangers to tell me I am. Then one night I found myself at a burlesque show. </p><p>The performance I saw didn't feature lap dances and poles. This was Vaudeville Nouveau, a modern take on the classic variety shows of the '20s and '30s. The burly-girls this night, Rubie Fizz and Legs Malone, were not titillators out for attention or dollar bills. They looked like regular women--beautiful and slim, to be sure, but no more or less so than you or me. And judging by their acts, smart, too. And funny. With boatloads of moxie. And the audience, men and women alike, cheered them on. I was hooked and determined to find out the difference between enjoying my 32As in the privacy of my own blouse and baring them to the world.</p><p>I headed to the New York School of Burlesque to learn the basics: shimmy, bump 'n' grind, and a simple chair dance. Headmistress Jo ""Boobs"" Weldon starts every class with the same directive: ""Claim your space."" What she actually means is ""Spread out so you don't swat each other with boas,"" but it's also a reminder to plant your flag in the sand, in and out of class. ""It's not about the strip--it's about the tease,"" says Rubie Fizz, my next stop on the road to my burly-q debut. The boob reveal is just the punch line. ""You can do a successful striptease with just a glove peel. The key to a successful act,"" she says, ""is to own up to who you are. <i>That's</i> sexy."" </p><p>But this is a <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/tips-from-a-sex-clinic"">burlesque show</a> we're talking about, and sexy also means stage makeup, costumes, and choreography. Rubie makes sure I get the glammy details right. This includes making me pasties from pink Swarovski crystals. To hold them in place, she recommends carpet tape (the double-sided stuff you get at hardware stores). Eyelashes? They <i>must</i> be worn and trimmed to follow the shape of your eye. Skin? Use Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs makeup to even out your skin tone. And, of course, glitter. I spend the next six weeks rehearsing and getting used to the feeling that moths are stuck to my eyelids. And even as I perfect my stocking peels, my evil inner voice, the one that hisses, ""Who do you think you are?"" keeps poking holes in my act--and my confidence: <i>Maybe I should do extra Pilates... Maybe I oughta lay off the bagels...</i> But the louder the voice, the more I fight. I stop <a href=""/fitness/get-rock-solid-abs"">working out</a>, except for rehearsals. I increase my bagel intake. </p><p>Showtime: My makeup is glittery, my hair blown out and tied in a discreet bow, my pasties firmly in place. Host Nelson Lugo introduces me by my pseudonym (on loan from a local performer): ""Miss Minerva Steel!"" French cabaret music fills the hall and I take the stage with a sultry strut. (Woo-hoo!) I flirt (with ""a knowing coquettishness,"" one observer remarked later) with a guy in the audience, poised as I slide a gorgeous foot in a '40s-style stiletto up my silk-stockinged calf, then pull a satin scarf off my neck and let it float to the floor. (More cheers!!) I peel off one stocking, then--­surprise!--unleash my wavy raven locks. (<i>Huge</i> cheers!) I hold a long, leggy pose and slooowly remove the other stocking. Now I start undoing my shirtdress buttons (snaps, actually: I had them converted in case my nerves made me shaky), tearing it open--just as I turn my back to the audience. I bare one shoulder, then the other, then shimmy off the frock, revealing frilly lingerie. (Yeah!!) I crescendo to the Big Finish, removing one bra strap at a time as I shake my booty. One final pose and, with the flick of a wrist, off flies the bra. I grant one quick flash, turn, and sashay toward the exit. (MI-NER-VA!!!) I oblige them with one last look and disappear. (Whistles! <i>Encore!!</i>) Guess that ""show your strengths"" thing really works.</p><p>Turns out the difference between private enjoyment and public display has a lot to do with being <a href=""/fitness/how-to-get-into-the-best-shape-1"">comfortable in my body</a> and not worrying about what others think. And it was true that I could have done it without showing boobs: To the crowd (OK, the friends I planted out there), the sexiest part was the way I took off my scarf. I'll still probably never be into playing dress-up, but I'll definitely remember how smokin' I felt batting those eyelashes.</p><p></p><p><b><br />How to do it yourself </b></p><p>So maybe you're not going to prance around onstage in your skivvies. (A lot of nights it would take the jaws of life just to get out of your sweats.) But you can amp up your sex appeal. Robin Antin, creator of the Pussycat Dolls pop ensemble and Vegas stage show, tells how to loosen up your buttons a bit.--Sarah Stebbins</p><p><b><br />Take dance classes</b> Hip-hop, jazz, ballet, belly dancing--they all provide a great workout and make you feel sexy. That attitude ""gets in your head,"" says Antin, and can change the way you carry yourself.</p><p><b><br />Break out the racy lingerie, just because. </b>Having ""a little secret can make you feel sexy and confident,"" says Antin, who likes a simple tank and booty-hugging jeans over her frilly things. But not too low with the jeans, she warns: ""Showing your crack is never sexy.""</p><p><b><br />Play peekaboo</b> ""Bangs shape your face and give you a style,"" she says. ""It's the cutest look, which is why a lot of the Pussycat Dolls in Vegas have them.""

The exceptions: ""If you've experienced a sudden trauma like a fall, or if the pain keeps you up at night or lasts longer than two weeks, you need to see a doctor,"" says Sabrina M. Strickland, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in sports medicine at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. Otherwise, you most likely have a nonserious injury that can be identified and treated by following the guide below.</p><p><strong>Lower Back</strong><br /><strong>What it could be:</strong> Piriformis syndrome (a tight butt muscle) or a herniated disk (some are worse than others). Both injuries put pressure on the sciatic nerve in your back.</p><p><strong>How it happened:</strong> The jury's out on what causes piriformis syndrome, but a herniated disk is often the result of improper lifting form or sports that involve rotating.</p><p><strong>DIY treatment:</strong> Take an OTC pain reliever, rest when you feel sore, then hit the gym: One study found that non-weight-bearing exercise (e.g., riding a stationary bike) and core training relieve <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/conditions/back-pain"">back pain</a> better than lying in bed.</p><p><strong>See the doc if:</strong> You also have a fever, leg weakness, or bladder changes. These symptoms may signal an infection or nerve compression.</p><p><strong>Elbow</strong><br /><strong>What it could be:</strong> Inflammation of the lateral epicondyle tendon (tennis elbow) or the medial epicondyle tendon (golfer's elbow)</p><p><strong>How it happened:</strong> Swinging a racket or club is the obvious culprit, but any activity that involves the elbow (like softball) can tax its tendons.</p><p><strong>DIY treatment:</strong> Swallow an OTC pain reliever, ice your elbow, pick up a brace at your local pharmacy to stabilize the tendons, and ease yourself back on course (or court).</p><p><strong>Knee</strong><br /><strong>What it could be:</strong> Pain on the outside of the knee signals an inflamed or tight iliotibial band (IT band), the tissue that runs from the hip to the knee. If it hurts around the kneecap, it could be runner's knee-a wearing away of the cartilage under the kneecap.</p><p><strong>How it happened:</strong> Increasing distance or speed too suddenly is the most common cause of an IT band injury, but research suggests it's also associated with weak hip abductors and glutes. Runner's knee is the result of overtraining, improper running form, or weak quads and hip muscles.</p><p><strong>DIY treatment:</strong> Loosen your IT band with this move: Lie on your side and support your weight with your forearm. Slip a foam roller under your hip and slowly roll down from your hip to your knee. Repeat this a few times a week. For runner's knee, reduce your mileage to a point that doesn't cause pain, and do leg lifts and presses to strengthen your quads and hamstrings.</p><p><strong>See the doc if:</strong> Your knee is very swollen or gives out. These signs point to a tear of the ACL or meniscus (knee cartilage).</p><p><strong>Heel</strong><br /><strong>What it could be:</strong> Plantar fasciitis-inflammation of the connective tissue at the bottom of the foot, which helps support your arch</p><p><strong>How it happened:</strong> The usual suspects include overtraining, running on hard surfaces, and wearing wornout running shoes.</p><p><strong>DIY treatment:</strong> OTC gel heel inserts may help reduce pain and swelling, and street runners may feel relief by switching to a treadmill or trail.</p><p><strong>Shin</strong><br /><strong>What it could be:</strong> Medial tibial stress syndrome (better known as shin splints)</p><p><strong>How it happened:</strong> The ""terrible too's"" (too much, too soon, too often, too fast, too hard) are usually to blame.</p><p><strong>DIY treatment:</strong> Switch to a non-weight-bearing exercise like swimming or biking for two weeks, and ice the area for 20 minutes after each session.</p><p><strong>See the doc if:</strong> Pain is localized on the outer edge of the shinbone. You may have a stress fracture.</p><p><strong>Ankle</strong><br /><strong>What it could be:</strong> A sprain, which happens when the ligaments are stretched beyond normal range</p><p><strong>How it happened:</strong> You rolled your ankle while playing tennis or soccer, or stepped in a pothole.</p><p><strong>DIY treatment:</strong> Do the RICE method: Rest; ice for 20 minutes three times a day; compress with an elastic bandage; and elevate your foot above heart level as much as possible for 48 hours.</p><p><strong>See the doc if:</strong> You can't put any weight on the injured foot, or if it's still swollen and painful after three days.</p><p>Sources : Sabrina M.

Especially since research shows that what you eat during the winter months can help you survive some of Mother Nature's cruelest whims. It turns out that the real <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-advice"">comfort food</a> when the thermometer dips isn't hot toddies, Mallomars, or mac and cheese, but nutritious options - like soup, salmon, and lots and lots of water - that trick your body into thinking it's July. Whether you're dealing with dry skin or bad moods, we've got five successful winter-eating strategies to leave you feeling your best and <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/files/eat-this-not-that/index.html"">stay healthy</a>- even when the weather is at its worst.<br /><br /><b>1. Drink fat-free milk to ward off the sniffles.</b><br /><br />When snow is on the ground, you're more likely to hit the gym (or the couch) than brave icy pavement. But less time outside means less sunlight, which is a key source of immunity-boosting <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/the-best-vitamins-for-women"">vitamin D</a>. Even if you do head out for a 15-minute stroll, sun exposure in northern cities like Boston and Minneapolis from November through February is too paltry to deliver enough of the vitamin, according to the National Institutes of Health.<br /><br />Fat-free milk is an easy, low-calorie fix for the sun deprived. ""You need about 200 IUs (international units) of vitamin D a day, and fortified milk can provide you with that easily,"" says Cindy Cassell, Ph.D., R.D., owner of Cincinnati-based Nutrition Access. Around 99 percent of the milk in the United States has been spiked with vitamin D, so down one 8-ounce glass a day to shield against coughing coworkers. <br /><br /><b>2. Eat oily fish and almonds to keep skin soft.</b><br /><br />Low temps outside and blasting heat inside lead to dry, flaky skin. While lotion is a great remedy, changing your diet can prevent parching in the first place. The best way to keep your outer layer lubricated is to increase your intake of healthy fats in your <a href=""http://eatthis.womenshealthmag.com/slideshow/9-best-winter-foods"">winter diet</a>. ""Fat is a nutrient that protects all cells, including your skin cells,"" says Kristine Clark, Ph.D., R.D., director of sports nutrition at Pennsylvania State University. If you consume too little fat, your skin becomes brittle. Add omega-3 fatty acids to your diet by eating fish like <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/best-fish-for-the-environment"">salmon</a> a few times a week to keep skin soft. <br /><br />Score your dose of vitamin E, another powerful skin protector, by snacking on almonds or pumpkin or sunflower seeds. ""A lack of vitamin E can influence the quality and texture of your skin,"" Clark says. Without it, your skin is at greater risk of damage from free radicals. ""If there is plenty of vitamin E in the membranes of cells exposed to free radicals, vitamin E will take the brunt of the attack and protect the fatty acid that surrounds all the intricate workings inside each cell,"" she says. <br /><br /><b>3. Banish winter blues with a bowl of oatmeal.</b><br /><br />When the days get shorter, so does your brain's supply of the feel-good chemical serotonin, says Judith Wurtman, Ph.D., visiting scientist at MIT and author of the forthcoming <i>Serotonin Power Diet</i> (Rodale, January 2007). ""That blah feeling we get in the winter is related to a lack of serotonin, which is linked to lack of sunlight,"" she says.<br /><br />Since serotonin can be found in food, you might think you can just eat your way to happiness by munching on chow high in the stuff. Unfortunately, it's not that easy; your brain needs to manufacture its own serotonin for you to get that euphoric effect. Eating the right foods in the right amounts will cause that chemical chain reaction in your body. ""As winter progresses and your moods get frailer, if you eat carbs in a calorie-controlled way, your brain can restore its serotonin to what it was in the summer,"" Wurtman says.<br /><br />She recommends eating a carb-based, 150- to 200 calorie, low-fat snack in the late afternoon (when moods tend to be at their lowest). Make it something with substance - try a satisfying instant oatmeal like <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/premium-packaged-foods"">Quaker Oats Oatmeal Crunch</a>. A small sweet potato, whole-grain toast, an English muffin with a bit of jam, or a snack-size bag of pretzels are other healthy carbohydrate sources. Large amounts of protein can interfere with serotonin production, so avoid eating protein-heavy foods for a couple of hours before your carb-rich snack.<br /><br /><b>4. Fight the urge to binge by slurping soup. </b><br /><br />That sudden need for chocolate chip cookies that hits you on freezing days isn't just psychological: Cold weather can actually trigger hunger, says Nancy Duncan, author of <i>Nancy Duncan's Sports Nutrition Handbook</i>. Your brain knows that eating raises your body temperature and warms you up, so it sends out signals encouraging you to eat. To keep yourself from autodialing the pizza joint every time you start to shiver, keep your pantry stocked with low-calorie, high-density foods that fill you up faster.<br /><br />""Water is the biggest influence of calorie density, so when you eat fruits and vegetables and broth-based <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/healthy-soup-recipes"">soups</a> - things packed with water - you'll feel more satisfied,"" says Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., professor of nutritional sciences at Pennsylvania State University and author of <i>The Volumetrics Eating Plan</i>. Water-rich foods like melon, mushrooms, and oatmeal stay there longer, Rolls says. There's a mental component too: Your brain takes note that a large bowl of soup looks like more food than a small doughnut - even if they contain equal calories. <br /><br /><b>5. Drink water when you work out - even if you're not thirsty. </b><br /><br />You'll win major fitness points for strapping on earmuffs and running in subzero temperatures, but beware: Exercising in the cold can trick your whole system. You still sweat, but the drier air zaps perspiration away before you even notice. ""I see this in athletes a lot,"" says Ann Grandjean, Ed.D., executive director of the Center for Human Nutrition. ""They don't realize they're sweating unless they actually see it."" That can quickly lead to dehydration. <br /><br />Take care to replace the fluid you're losing. Weigh yourself before and after a workout, Grandjean says. For every pound you lose, drink 2 cups of fluid. (Any weight loss that happens within a few hours is all water.) Water and sports drinks are your best bets, but ""you should drink what you like,"" she says, even if that's tea-caffeinated beverages hydrate just as well as noncaffeinated ones.

""I'd scrub and vacuum while my husband vegged out in front of the TV,"" the 27-year-old recalls. ""My <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/get-your-libido-back"">libido</a> took a serious nosedive, but it took me a long time to realize that it wasn't anxiety or hormones."" A sink full of dishes, an overflowing trash bin, and a living room that desperately needed straightening were to blame. <br /><br />A whopping 68 million women in the United States - nearly 60 percent - work outside the home. But we still spend at least an hour more each day than men on <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/get-him-to-do-housework"">household tasks</a> like cleaning and caring for children. Even ""enlightened"" couples may slip into Leave It to Beaver mode at the end of the workday - meaning that she mans the stove and picks up the Star Wars action figures while he puts his feet up, says couples therapist Bonnie Eaker Weil, Ph.D., author of Make Up, Don't Break Up. In one survey more than half of the female respondents said they had more chores and obligations than they used to, which made <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/simplify-your-life-0"">leisure time</a> less relaxing and less enjoyable. Sound familiar? <br /><br />The problem is that, like Stacy, most of us don't know why our libidos are low - meaning there's no way our guys could hope to figure it out either. ""I'd estimate that up to 90 percent of women with decreased sex drive don't know what's causing the problem,"" says gynecologist and obstetrician Judith Reichman, M.D., author of I'm Not in the Mood: What Every Woman Should Know About Improving Her Libido. Step one: Talk to your doctor, she advises. ""A simple blood test can rule out causes like medications, low hormones, or other health conditions."" Step two: Dig out your sexiest lingerie, grab him by the boxers, and find a cozy B&B for the weekend. ""If you can resurrect your sex life on vacation, you'll know that the stresses of everyday life - such as too much housework - are probably the cause [of your problem],"" Dr. Reichman says. <br /><br />The stress of having too much to do around the house can elevate your cortisone levels, which in turn lowers testosterone production and leads to your pooped-out libido. There's an emotional component as well. ""Excessive chores and not enough help from your partner create fatigue, resentment, and frustration, all of which can significantly lower your sex drive,"" Dr. Weil says. ""Exhaustion alone can crush a relationship. Ask any woman why she doesn't have as much sex as she'd like to, and chances are, she'll tell you she's just too tired.""<br /><br /><b>Drop that duster ...</b><br /><br />So now what? That vacuum isn't going to start running itself. But chances are you can get by with a little less hoovering and dusting. Learning to let go of the things you feel you have to do is key to reenergizing. ""People tend to mimic the way their parents interacted,"" Dr. Weil says. So if your mom and dad fit those breadwinner vs. bread-baker stereotypes, you may be going the traditional route too without realizing it. ""Even in the 21st century,"" she adds, ""there's the belief that a woman's worth is reflected in her home - regardless of whether she makes a six-figure salary, has interesting hobbies, or great relationships with her family and friends."" It doesn't help that the TV is awash with commercials showing women who find bliss in a bathroom that smells like springtime. <br /><br />Tackle your tortured relationship with those dust bunnies by first establishing some priorities. ""Sometimes it's all about making choices,"" Dr. Weil says. ""It's deciding, 'I'm not going to do laundry; I'm going to have sex tonight.'"" If you still feel the need to clean the microwave when you could be rolling around with your spouse, one expert, psychologist and professional organizer Ronit Zweig, Psy.D., advises you to rethink your time-management skills. Right away. ""Setting a schedule can help you find a happy medium,"" Dr. Zweig says. ""Having a plan - Monday is laundry, Tuesday is vacuuming, and so on - means you're not unnecessarily repeating the same tasks. Plus, you'll know exactly when everything will be taken care of, so you won't have to obsess over what's not done."" <br /><br />If that seems too rigid, try this: Set a timer for 20 minutes when you start cleaning - and drop the mop the minute the alarm sounds. And if you still find yourself fluffing the living room pillows the minute you get home, Dr. Zweig suggests trying an alternative after-work ritual that relaxes you, like having a glass of wine with your guy.<br /><br />Speaking of your guy: Why not hand him the Hoover once in a while? It wasn't until Stacy began trading her evening cleaning routine for the occasional salsa class or art exhibit that she realized her sexual dry spell came from too much time with the dishrag. And when she told her husband, he responded by scouring their entire apartment and making her dinner. ""I was too exhausted to be romantic that night, but the next morning, we had mind-blowing sex,"" she recalls. ""Now I often come home to a clean place - and frankly there's no bigger turn-on.""<br /><br />The proof is in the dishpan hands: A study from the University of Washington found that when men pitch in on chores and child care, it often puts their partners right in the mood. ""When a man does the dishes, vacuums, or puts the kids to bed, it sends a signal that he cares - and it removes some of the stress of everyday life from his girlfriend or wife,"" says couples therapist Ian Kerner, Ph.D., author of She Comes First: The Thinking Man's Guide to Pleasuring a Woman. ""Both may help her regain desire.""<br /><br />And all you have to do is ask. Okay, maybe more than once. ""You may have to remind him several times until he remembers on his own, but chances are he'll do it,"" Dr. Kerner says. ""Most men just don't realize that a to-do list the size of Texas could lead to their partner's lack of interest in sex. It's a revelation that almost always encourages them to pick up the Swiffer.""<br /><br /><b>... and slowly hand it to him</b><br /><br />The trick is to break him in easy. ""The worst thing you can do is attack him or tell him that he's the reason your sex life is on the fritz,"" Dr. Weil says. ""Instead, bring up times where he's helped you out"" - remind him how great it was when he did the laundry for you - ""and then nicely mention that you would love a little more of that."" If he doesn't take an immediate shine to the Clorox wipes, nudge him into it by asking him to lend you a hand - washing dishes while you dry at his side or putting fresh sheets on the bed (so you guys can mess them up again).<br /><br />And remember, Dr. Weil says, ""Chances are, your boyfriend or husband is just as overworked and overwhelmed as you are."" In fact, his coping strategy may be the exact opposite of yours - doing less instead of doing more. So before you hit him up with a two-page, single-spaced list of new to-do's, ask how he's managing his own stress. ""You may just realize,"" Dr. Weil says, ""that the best solution isn't for either of you to do more - it's to hire a cleaning service.<br />",relationships

But the really dangerous pains are the ones that feel innocent enough to ignore yet are actually the smoke signals to a health fire that could be burning inside you. Chances are, the majority of your minor pains are no reason to reserve the corner plot. But to protect yourself, you need to know how to make sure your harmless pains are just that - and nothing more. <br /><br /><b>Tummy Turmoil</b><br /><br /><b>Make Sure It's Not...</b> What feels like <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/yoga-poses-to-ease-indigestion"">indigestion</a> after eating a fatty, fried, or greasy meal may actually be your gallbladder trying to contract and squeeze bile out in response to that beef chalupa. But the bile can't get out because <b>gallstones</b> - solidified bits of cholesterol and other matter - are blocking the exit. The result: ""It's kind of a dull, vague pain that can wax and wane over several hours,"" says Beth Schorr-Lesnick, M.D., a gastroenterologist in Yonkers, New York. The pain, felt just below the rib cage on the right side, may even radiate into the right shoulder blade. Thanks to estrogen, we're also three times as likely to develop <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/conditions/gallstones"">gallstones</a> as men (20 percent of us will have them by the time we're 60), and being on the Pill and being pregnant raises the risk. Ignore it and the pain will worsen - it's almost like childbirth going on in the upper right part of your belly. An <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/conditions/ultrasound"">ultrasound</a> or sonogram will detect <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/conditions/gallstones"">gallstones</a>, and your doctor will likely schedule a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to remove the gallbladder (done under general anesthesia and about a 2-day hospital stay, it's now one of the most common surgeries in the United States). To help thwart stones, eat more insoluble fiber. A recent study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology reports that a 5-gram increase in insoluble fiber intake drops your risk of developing gallstones by 10 percent. Good sources include whole grains like quinoa, nuts, and the edible skins of fruits and vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, apples, berries, and pears.<br /><br /><b>Sore Throat </b><br /><br /><b>Make Sure It's Not...</b> Tea, honey, or lozenges may be well and good to relieve the curl-up-in-bed soreness. But know this: <b>a heart attack</b> can also grab you in the gullet. University of Rochester researchers recently found that during a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/indigestion-or-heart-attack"">heart attack</a>, women reported feeling discomfort in their throats 12 times more than men. (And 90 percent of women who had heart attacks reported that they experienced ""new"" or ""different"" symptoms.) ""Often, women will say that their heart attack symptoms were not the type of intense pain they expected, but rather an uncomfortable feeling - more of a tightness or heaviness,"" says Kathleen King, R.N., Ph.D., a professor of nursing at the University of Rochester. Throat pain may result from the same thing that causes chest pain in heart attack sufferers: lack of blood flow to the heart, says Paula Johnson, M.D., a cardiologist and executive director of Women's Health at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Yet heart attack pain manifests itself differently in men and women (35 percent of heart attacks in women go unnoticed or unreported), and many women don't recognize the subtle signs, which also can include nausea, sweatiness, and fatigue. To better protect yourself, oil up: A study in the journal Chest found daily supplements of 2 grams of fish and soy oils, which contain heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, significantly improved participants' heart function in just 2 weeks.<br /><br /><b>Burning Belly</b><br /><br /><b>Make Sure It's Not...</b> <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/cures-for-common-stomach-pains"">Stomachaches</a> typically come from hunger, nerves, indigestion, or whiny interns. But if you feel the discomfort underneath the notch of the sternum, the burn could indicate <b>an ulcer</b>. Try this test: ""With an ulcer, when you eat the food kind of buffers it and relieves the pain very promptly,"" says Patricia Raymond, M.D., a gastroenterologist in Chesapeake, Virginia. You can't blame your mother-in-law, boss, or traffic for this one. Most ulcers form when a type of bacteria - called Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) - burrows in your stomach lining, weakening a protective layer of mucus and then allowing acid to eat at that lining. If you don't treat it, you risk perforating it (requiring surgery) and you also increase your risk of gastric cancer. In fact H. pylori may be responsible for up to 55 percent of gastric cancer cases. A blood test or a no-needle breath test can detect the bacteria, and then antibiotics will usually clear it up. While you're at it, pucker up: In one study drinking a tall glass of cranberry juice every day for 90 days significantly suppressed H. pylori. ""It looks like it works by decreasing the adhesion of the bacteria to the stomach,"" Dr. Raymond says. <br /><br /><b>Sore Gums </b><br /><br /><b>Make Sure It's Not...</b> You can stop strong-arming your toothbrush, but the truth is even a little soreness in your gums suggests <b>periodontal disease</b>, which destroys gum tissue and the bone that keeps your teeth in place. Symptoms like pain, bleeding, and even bad breath may surface only when your hormones are imbalanced - for example, during menstruation, pregnancy, menopause, or while on birth control pills. If soreness lasts for more than a few days, get checked, says Kenneth Krebs, D.M.D., president of the American Academy of Periodontology. Otherwise you're at higher risk of atherosclerosis, heart attack, stroke, respiratory diseases, and infertility. Save your smile and choose automatic over manual. A study published in the British journal The Cochrane Library found that electric brushes with heads that rotate in one direction and then the other were 11 percent more effective at removing plaque and 6 percent more effective at reducing gingivitis (early-stage periodontitis).<br /><br /><b>Major Cramps</b><br /><br /><b>Make Sure It's Not...</b> When menstrual cramps make you feel like you've got a blender spinning inside, you usually chalk it up to a bad month or bad genes. But some experts say that severe cramps may indicate <b>endometriosis</b>. The cause is unknown but the danger isn't. ""Endometriosis can affect other organs, and that can lead to infertility,"" says Ozgul Muneyyirci-Delale, M.D., director of the Center for Treatment and Study of Endometriosis at the SUNY Downstate Medical Center. What's more, the National Institutes of Health reports that women with endometriosis are more likely to have allergies, asthma, and immune diseases. One caveat: Severe cramps don't automatically mean you have endometriosis. While surgery is the only way to diagnose endometriosis, your doctor may suggest other options for pain relief. Studies have shown that taking 200 milligrams of vitamin E twice a day a couple of days before your period arrives and through the first 3 days of bleeding may relieve cramps. <br /><br /><b>Hoarse Voice </b><br /><br /><b>Make Sure It's Not...</b> We usually write off that Demi Moore voice as a sign of an oncoming cold or the end of a Springsteen concert. But hoarseness - however subtle or sporadic - lasting more than 2 weeks (the time it takes viral infections to clear up) may signal an underlying problem like <b>hypothyroidism or reflux</b>. ""People can have hoarseness as the only sign of reflux,"" says Mona Abaza, M.D., assistant professor of otolaryngology at the University of Colorado. But it could also be caused by simply speaking loudly (like in a crowded restaurant). ""You can have small hemorrhages in your vocal folds, and they can be the start of polyps or nodules,"" Dr. Abaza says. If not tended to, these noncancerous, fleshy growths cause chronic hoarseness. See a doctor if symptoms last more than 2 weeks and drink lots of water to keep your throat lubricated. Avoid cold medications with antihistamines, alcohol, caffeine, and chocolate, which tend to dry out and further irritate your vocal cords. Caffeine does it by stimulating your body to get rid of its excess water, while antihistamines have a drying effect on the mucous membranes, says Clark Rosen, M.D., director of the Voice Center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Eye and Ear Institute.<br />",You and Improved

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/abusive-bosses,Life,8,14,0,1,0,2,5,0,,How to Survive an Abusive Boss,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0812-abusive-boss.jpg,"<p>No one deserves to go to work each day and deal with their version of Thomas Harvey. He was the notorious high-level male manager at the National Education Association's (NEA) Alaska affiliate who subjected three female employees to daily verbal abuse, profanity, and physical intimidation. He'd been known to shake his fists at women, grab their shoulders, and come within striking distance. What's worse? His company stood behind him, promoting him to executive director despite the women's complaints. But in 2001, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a lawsuit against NEA-Alaska, and the $750,000 settlement awarded sent a powerful message: <a href=""/life/workplace-sexual-harassment"">Workplace abuse</a> targeted at women is unlawful and will not be tolerated. </p><p>According to a recent study by the Employment Law Alliance, 44 percent of U.S. employees say they've worked for an <a href=""/life/coping-with-bullies"">abusive boss</a>. While dirty looks and snide comments are fast becoming the office norm, one day your superior may cross the legal line-and you can, and should, take action. ""Whenever your supervisor's treatment has a negative impact on your ability to perform your job, you have an obligation to yourself and your employer to turn that situation around,"" says Kirstin Muller, an employment attorney in Santa Monica, Calif. ""Our most common complaint is yelling,"" Muller explains. ""Throwing things is another big issue."" Below, some ways to handle an unhealthy relationship with your blowhard boss.</p><p><b>Know where to draw the line.</b> If your boss makes a derogatory statement about your religion, ethnicity, or gender, it's a given that the behavior's completely unacceptable. But what about the gray areas, like subtly embarrassing you during a staff meeting or outwardly grabbing your shoulder? ""Anything that's generally a put-down rather than constructive criticism is generalized harassment,"" Muller says. Basically, if you feel uncomfortable or threatened in any way, take the issue to Human Resources. The sooner you face the problem head-on, the quicker and easier it'll be to reach a resolution. </p><p><b>Befriend HR.</b> While it would be ideal to head off your dilemma directly with your boss, without the involvement of a third party, that's usually not the best game plan, warns Muller. That's because abusive managers are more likely to retaliate, since they lose their cool so easily. It's a better idea to go to HR, since theoretically, it's their job to stand up for your rights as an employee. Don't worry about whether you feel comfortable with HR, Muller explains: ""HR professionals should be able to handle your complaint in a professional manner, even if they've never spoken to you before."" And they should do so in a timely fashion. In fact, the moment you walk into their office, the investigation should begin, and steps should be taken in the coming days or weeks. </p><p></p><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/images/career-center/ask-nicole.gif"" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p></p><p><b>Arrive armed with specific examples.</b> When it comes time for a meeting, leave your emotions at the door and come equipped with concrete examples of your boss' abusive actions. Evidence of nasty e-mails and detailed documentation of humiliating experiences, with context and witnesses noted, will get HR on your side more quickly-and you're more likely to score points for professionalism, too. Then, explain how this situation impacts the bottom line. Make the connection between your boss' actions and how they're reducing the productivity of yourself or your team. </p><p><b>Don't be afraid to go over their heads.</b> On the other hand, if your HR department is just as dysfunctional as your relationship with your boss, consider taking your grievances to the president of the company or a higher level of management. And if they too aren't responsive, then think about taking it to court-which, unfortunately, requires even more patience. Expect a wait time of one to four years, since they're overwhelmed with cases, Muller explains. On a brighter note: ""The greater the abuse is and the less the company does to stop it once you've exhausted their internal complaint mechanisms, the greater chances for success and financial victory,"" Muller says. </p><p><b>Know your rights.</b> Right now, 11 individual state legislatures are considering laws to specifically prohibit abuse in the workplace. ""These cases are just starting to hit the courts,"" Muller says. Meanwhile, there are organizations that protect workers' rights, such as the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.EEOC.org"">EEOC</a> and <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.equalrights.org"">Equal Rights Advocates</a>. It's important to speak up and do your part to make change. Explains Muller, ""The majority of employees accept a lot of behavior because they don't think they can change it. But they can."" </p>",Career Center

I'd end up going maybe three or four times. Those visits probably came to about $850 each! Getting to the gym felt like pressure, and I have enough of that in my life. And the whole endorphins-make-you-feel-good stuff? I thought it was B.S.</p><p>Then last summer, when I was 40, I had surgery to remove a cyst from my vocal cord. The easy part was the operation; I was in and out of the hospital in three hours. The hard part was going from talking nonstop 12 to 16 hours a day to having to shut up completely for three weeks! I had a ton of pent-up energy. In just the first two days, I went through four notebooks, writing down everything I would otherwise have been saying aloud and all of the ideas that I wasn't able to talk to anyone about.</p><p><br />I started going to the gym with John to see if I could run off some of the frustration of not being able to speak. I was miserable at first. I hated running. Some days I did the elliptical machine instead because my knees were bothering me so much. But I kept going back.</p><p>Then, at the end of those three no-talking weeks, I was on the elliptical one day and realized I was <i>smiling</i>. It hit me that I was actually happy to be doing this thing I had thought I hated. Exercising was helping me think better and be more focused. I wasn't losing my temper as quickly, and my mood was more even. Things that normally pissed me off didn't anymore. Like, you know when your grocery bag breaks and you feel heartbroken? When stuff like that happened, I'd stay calm for longer. (Don't get me wrong: I'm still a Sicilian woman. When I go off, I go off!)</p><p>I got hooked on working out. And when I get obsessed with something, I get <i>obsessed</i>. Now I usually go to the gym six mornings a week. I'd always been a night owl and dreaded mornings, but I've become that person who pops out of bed excited to go to the gym at 6:30 a.m. Even when I have an early TV gig, I still go. I'll wake up at 4:45, walk a block to the gym, and be there at five o'clock when it opens. </p><p>John and I usually go together, dressed in his-and-hers Nike Shox and black Adidas track pants-we're like the Bobbsey twins. First we'll hit the cardio machines; I do three and a half miles either running on the treadmill or using the elliptical. That's my superfun time. I just listen to my music. I crank my boy Dave Grohl or Florence and the Machine so loud that it's probably bad for my eardrums. But I <i>loooove</i> music, and I want my time with it. </p><p>Then I do strength work on the machines: biceps, triceps, the twisty one (I call it the twist and shout) where you hold on to the handles, the thing that looks like a chair without a seat that you hold yourself up on, and my personal favorite, the crunch machine. I really dig the machines-they're like the monkey bars at the playground. Then I do what I call my bendy-stretchy and go home.</p><p>That hour at the gym is my recess from being Rachael Ray. Between my daytime show, the Food Network shows, my magazine, and my books, I'm always <i>go, go, go</i>! But working out is <i>my</i> time. That's why I don't use a trainer. I'd feel like it was about making the trainer happy, not making me happy. Plus, trainers want you to listen to them. I like listening to my music. </p><p>Since I started working out, I've realized what a smooth cat I've become. I feel like I wasted a large part of my adult life not exercising. That's how much it benefits me, from the way I think, to the energy that it gives me, to the way it sets the tone for my entire day. </p><p>I feel physically stronger too. As far as how clothes fit and the rest of that junk? Yes, it's easier to shop because stuff looks better on me. And I get more compliments now on my appearance than I ever did before. But none of that motivates me as much as the mental benefits do. </p><p>I always say I'll have time to be skinny when I'm dead. And I think one of the reasons I got the heaviest I've ever been (and I don't get on scales, so I can't even guess how big I actually got) was for the same reason that a lot of women fall off track: When you live with someone who loves you and supports you and tells you nice things, you don't have the awareness that you could stand to lose a few. </p><p>That said, my husband pats me on the ass now a little more than he used to. And that's pretty cool too! </p><p><b>Snack Time</b></p><p>Rachael drinks ""gallons of water"" and stays true to her Mediterranean heritage, using lots of whole foods and generous amounts of her beloved EVOO. We got her to share two of her healthy, hunger-busting food fixes.</p><p><b>1/ Tuna Antipasti</b> Drizzle canned tuna (she likes to use white, packed in water) with a little fresh lemon juice and EVOO (extra-virgin olive oil). Then chop up your favorite antipasti (roasted red<202F>peppers, artichoke hearts, and olives are Rachael's go-tos) and mix together. </p><p><b>2/ Greek Yogurt Veggie Dip</b> Mix 2 cups nonfat Greek yogurt with 1 teaspoon each garlic powder, ground cumin, and ground coriander. Add the juice of half a lemon and salt and pepper to taste. Serve with assorted veggies for dipping, such as carrots, celery, and zucchini.</p>",Celebrities

We love to love our java, the ultimate energy shortcut -- it's cheap, guilt free, and practically everywhere. In fact, research increasingly supports a caffeinated life. One recent study at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that subjects who drank 4 or more cups of coffee a day lowered their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by a third. And every athlete knows that a jolt of caffeine an hour before exercise can improve endurance. Not to mention that it's a surprisingly robust source of antioxidants. We could go on<br /><br />There's a dark side to your daily Venti, though.

Heart palpitations, headaches, irritability, and/or aggression are all signs of an affair gone wrong. ""We've seen women who thought they were having panic attacks but were just drinking too much coffee,"" says Mark Gold, M.D., professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at the University of Florida College of Medicine.<br /><br />So how should you harness caffeine for <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/how-to-get-more-energy-0"">energy</a> without twitching for a hit? First, pay attention to how much you're really drinking: Not only is caffeine found in cola (31mg), RedBull (67 mg), and dark chocolate candy bars (30 mg), it's also in a lot of ""decaf"" drinks. When Bruce Goldberger, Ph.D., a professor at the University of Florida, bought 22 decaffeinated beverages, he was shocked to find that caffeine amounts ranged from none to nearly 14 milligrams per 16-ounce cup. (That's enough to zap lightweights. In a separate study, more than half the participants felt caffeinated after just 18 milligrams.) And fully caffeinated drinks are more turbocharged than ever. In 2003, Goldberger found between 259 and 564 milligrams of caffeine in 16 ounces of Starbucks coffee. ""A NoDoz contains 200 milligrams, and some cups of coffee have nearly three times that,"" he notes.<br /><br />If you want to scale back, start by substituting a cup of green tea for every cup of coffee. You'll still consume 30 milligrams of caffeine, but tea has theanine, an amino acid with calming effects.

After college she met her now husband, Bryan, and got into the habit of splitting extra-large pizzas with him and ordering buffalo wings for Sunday-night football. Their junk-food feasts caused Kristen to tip the scale at 180 pounds. When Bryan proposed in 2009, it was a wake-up call for the 25-year-old special-ed teacher, who vowed to shed weight from her 5'6"" frame before getting hitched.<br /><br /><b>The Change</b><br />While shopping for size-16 wedding gowns in February 2010, Kristen's mom sensed her daughter's misery. She sent Kristen an encouraging note, pledging her support and offering to buy her a new smaller-size outfit for the rehearsal dinner. ""My mom wanted to see me happy, so she motivated me to do something about my weight,"" says Kristen. ""She told me to do it as a wedding gift to myself.""<br /><br /><b>The Lifestyle</b><br />Kristen trimmed her portions and added <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/lose-weight-with-foods-that-burn-fat"">fat burning foods</a> like lean protein, veggies, and fiber-rich whole grains to her meals. Bryan joined her for daily after-dinner walks, and by May 2010, one month into her shape-up, Kristen's clothes felt looser. Then Bryan suggested jogging their usual one-mile route, and for added incentive they signed up for a 5-K. Kristen increased her evening runs by half-mile increments, and she finished her first race bursting with pride. She immediately signed up for another and ran one or two a month until her November nuptials. A month before the big day, she was fitting into size-6 clothes.<br /><br /><b>The Reward</b><br />Before her slim-down, Kristen avoided cameras.

Here's why: The spine is your body's shock absorber; letting it sag causes imbalances, forcing the muscles and ligaments in your neck, shoulders, back, and legs to compensate. This, of course, makes you more prone to injury.<br /><br /> Hunching can also affect your health: A 2007 study by the University of Leeds found a link between muscles in the neck and a part of the brainstem that regulates blood pressure and heart rate. Still need convincing? Rounding your back--say, as you tire out on a run--presses the rib cage and internal organs against your lungs, keeping them from expanding efficiently. The result: Less oxygen gets to your muscles, which makes you run and recover more slowly. <p></p><p>We powwowed with posture gurus from four alignment-conscious disciplines--Pilates, ballet, yoga, and the Alexander Technique--to get their most effective right--yourself moves. Add at least one to your fitness regimen three times a week to breathe easier, up your endurance, and safeguard your spine in only six weeks.</p><p></p>Exercise   <br /><br />Pilates<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0903-lean-pilates-300.jpg"" /><br /><br />Two prereqs for any Pilates move: (1) engaging your inner abs, which support the muscles in your back, and (2) lifting and lengthening your upper body. ""Think of your spine as a bendy straw,"" explains New York City Pilates instructor Kristin McGee. Everyday movements like walking, sitting, and driving compact that straw. Pilates stretches it out again. ""People say they grow an inch in class,"" McGee says. ""It's really just that you find the space in your spine that you always had.""<br /><br /><strong>Try it: <em>The X </em></strong><br />Lie on your stomach with your arms and legs extended, forming an X. Brace your abs and relax your shoulders. Inhale and lift your arms and legs off the floor, making sure your legs go no higher than your arms. Exhale, bending your elbows toward your waist and pulling your legs together. Repeat 6 to 8 times.<br /><br />Exercise   <br /><br />Ballet<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0903-lean-ballet-300.jpg"" /><br /><br />There's a reason you can spot a ballet dancer when she's not in her tutu: She's the one with the stick-straight posture. ""Much of ballet is designed to lengthen the body from the base of the spine to the crown of the head,"" says Elise Gulan, a former professional dancer and the creator of the DVD <em>Element: Ballet Conditioning</em>. ""Ballerinas are taught to pull their abs in and up. Doing so creates a lift in the spine."" Take this cue: Imagine you have a string tied to the top of your head and somebody is pulling it from above.<br /><br /><strong>Try it: <em>Port de Bras</em></strong><br />Stand with your heels touching and your toes turned out. Brace your abs. Keeping your shoulders down, raise both arms overhead. Bend forward, reaching your hands toward your toes while keeping your back flat. Go only as far as you can without losing your form. Brace your abs again, stand up, and, with arms still raised, arch backward slightly. Repeat 8 times.<br /><br />Exercise   <br /><br />Yoga<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0903-lean-yoga-300.jpg"" /><br /><br />Yogis think of the spine as the wire that makes the body hum. They talk about chakras and whatnot, but the bottom line is this: The spine is responsible for sending messages throughout your body, and when you're hunched, the pathway isn't as smooth, says Alison West, co­director of Yoga Union Center for Back Care and Scoliosis in New York City. Yoga strengthens the muscles that extend and realign your spine so your vertebrae aren't squished.<br /><br /><strong>Try it: <em>Extended Side Angle Pose</em></strong><br />Stand with your feet about four feet apart and turn your left foot out about 90 degrees. Extend your arms, palms down, at shoulder height. Bend your left knee until it's over your ankle. Flex from the waist to the left and place your left hand outside your left foot. (Can't reach the floor? Place your elbow on your knee or your hand on the inside of your foot--as shown below--­instead.) Reach your right arm over your ear and turn your chin toward your right armpit. Look up and take five slow breaths. Return to standing and switch sides. Repeat 3 to 5 times. New to yoga? Do the move with your back against a wall. ""Using the wall takes the balance component out of it,"" West says, ""so you can concentrate on lengthening your spine and rolling your chest open.""<br /><br />Watch a <a target=""blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/yoga/extended-side-angle-pose"">video demo</a> of this pose. Exercise   <br /><br />Alexander Technique<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0903-lean-alexander-300.jpg"" /><br /><br />A discipline devoted to correcting harmful habitual movements, the Alexander Technique restores the body's natural posture, which is often hidden behind tense muscles. By focusing on your movements, you lengthen and expand your torso and properly align your neck over your spine. The result: You feel lighter, taller, and more graceful--and as if you could stay that way forever. ""When you get rid of muscular tension through correct alignment, standing tall feels effortless,"" explains Posie Green, an Alexander Technique instructor in Wheat Ridge, Colorado.<br /><br /><strong>Try it: <em>Kneeling Roll</em></strong><br />Kneel with your hands resting on a Swiss ball. Bend at the hips and, keeping your neck in line with your spine, roll the ball away from your body until your arms are extended and your spine is as long as possible. Roll the ball a few inches to the right, then to the left. Roll side to side three more times, going a little farther with each roll.<br /><br />",Workouts

How to Preserve Your Fertility,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0903-mainimage-300x.jpg,"<p>Considering you probably spend a good amount of energy trying to block conception, it's kind of odd to think about preparing yourself for a day when you might want to raise the gate to your reproductive system and having a baby. Maybe you're not at that point now-you're happily putting in long hours at a job you love, you're still enjoying being able to jump in the car for a road trip on a moment's notice, or you just haven't yet found a guy who's worthy of mixing his <a href=""/health/dna-testing"">DNA</a> with yours. But you'd still like to think that if the baby jones hits you like a ton of bricks, pregnancy over 40 won't be a problem.</p><p>Yet everywhere you look, an article or book (or even your own mom!) is there to remind you that your fertility drops every year you wait. You probably know the scary stats: Women reach their reproductive peak in their twenties, and by age 35, the risk of infertility jumps to 22 percent. But before you start Googling egg freezing (by the way, that's still experimental, and only a tiny number of babies have been born from frozen eggs), keep in mind that every woman's <a href=""/health/protect-your-fertility"">biological clock</a> is different. Some women can get pregnant easily at 40, while others run into problems as early as their twenties. And while you can't stop the clock on the most important fertility factor-your age-there are plenty of lifestyle changes you can make now to up your odds of getting pregnant later. </p><p><b>If you want to get pregnant in five years... </b></p><p><b>See your doctor.</b> If you want to keep your body baby-ready, staying in top physical shape is essential. That means getting any fertility-sapping health issues-like diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or endometriosis-under control; diagnosing and treating <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/sexual-health"">STDs</a>; and devising a healthy diet and exercise plan. If you're past 35 and wondering whether you have the option of waiting a few more years, you can also ask your doc to do a little detective work on what's known as your ovarian reserve. </p><p>""All women are born with a certain number of eggs, and you lose them over your reproductive life span,"" explains Michael Soules, M. D., medical director of Seattle Reproductive Medicine. ""At some point- about 10 years before the onset of menopause- the number drops to a level where your fertility is compromised."" But there are <a href=""/health/a-blood-test-can-measure-your-fertility"">fertility tests</a> that can gauge how many eggs are still sitting on the bench waiting for their turn at bat. The best ones are an ultrasound to count the number of follicles in your ovaries and a blood test to check your hormone levels at certain points in your cycle. These tests, which Soules says are usually covered by insurance-check with your plan to make sure-can't guarantee that you're fertile (too many other factors come into play). But they can tell you how loudly your clock is ticking and whether you need to consider speeding up your schedule. </p><p>><b>Brush and floss.</b> Could something as simple as flossing your teeth help keep you fertile? Perhaps. ""Several studies have indicated that a woman's oral health may be related to her reproductive success,"" says Susan Karabin, D. D. S., a spokesperson for the American Academy of Periodontology. In one study, women who needed fertility treatments had higher levels of gum bleeding and inflammation than those who conceived naturally, the <i>Journal of Periodontology</i> reports. ""Brush and floss every day and get a professional cleaning and exam every six months,"" advises Karabin, who adds that not smoking and avoiding sugary foods and drinks are also key to keeping your teeth and gums healthy. </p><p>><b>Practice safe sex.</b> You wouldn't think condoms would come up in a conversation about getting pregnant, but safe sex can be a crucial factor in your future ability to get knocked up. If you contract an STD such as gonorrhea or chlamydia (which could be in your system without causing symptoms) and it goes untreated, it can lead to a serious condition called pelvic inflammatory disease, which can scar the fallopian tubes, causing infertility. So get tested regularly-and make sure your partners do, too. </p><p>><b>Stamp out cigarettes.</b> If higher rates of lung cancer and breast cancer haven't made you swear off smoking, consider this: The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) estimates that lighting up is linked to 13 percent of infertility cases. Tobacco messes with your fertility in all kinds of ways: It makes your eggs deteriorate faster than they naturally would with age, increases your risk of early miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy (a dangerous condition in which the egg implants in your fallopian tubes or ovaries instead of your uterus), and can bring on early menopause (up to four years earlier, compared with nonsmokers). Plus, if you wind up needing in vitro fertilization (IVF), smoking will reduce your chances of success by 34 percent. The encouraging news, though, is that once you do quit smoking, your fertility level will return to normal in about a year (considering that it takes the average puffer two to four tries before quitting for good, you should start trying to kick the habit well before that). While you're at it, recruit your partner, parents, and friends to quit with you: A recent study in <i>Tobacco Control</i> found that women who were exposed to secondhand smoke six or more hours a day as adults were 36 percent more likely to have trouble getting pregnant. </p><p>><b>Take your vitamins.</b> ""Every woman of reproductive age-even if you're not actively trying to get pregnant-should take a multivitamin containing folic acid,"" says Jorge Chavarro, M. D., an instructor at Harvard Medical School and co-author of <i>The Fertility Diet</i>"" According to Chavarro, <a target=""_self"" href=""/experts/folic-acid"">folic acid</a> appears to improve fertility by stimulating ovulation and giving an embryo essential proteins needed for survival. His research also found that women who took iron supplements were 40 percent less likely to have fertility problems, so look for a vitamin with at least 40 milligrams of iron and 400 micrograms of folic acid, and get in the habit of downing the pill every morning. </p><p></p><p><b>If you want to get pregnant in two years, do all of the above, plus... </b></p><p>><b>Switch up your grocery list.</b> In Chavarro's groundbreaking study of the dietary habits of more than 18,000 nurses who were trying to get pregnant, he found some striking connections between food and fertility. There are four basic rules of a baby-friendly diet: </p><p><b>1.</b> Choose slowly digested carbohydrates (such as vegetables and whole grains) over highly processed ones (such as white bread and white rice). </p><p><b>2.</b> Eliminate trans fats (aka partially hydrogenated oils). </p><p><b>3.</b> Pick unsaturated fats over saturated fats. </p><p><b>4.</b> Get the majority of your protein from plants rather than animals. </p><p>This type of low-glycemic diet, which keeps your blood-sugar level nice and steady, has long been known to fight diabetes and improve cardiovascular health, but it also can have a profound effect on fertility. ""When you eat foods that spike your blood sugar, such as simple carbohydrates, your body produces more insulin, and that in turn leads to a higher amount of testosterone circulating throughout your body,"" Chavarro says. ""Over time that can interfere with ovulation."" He explains that different types of fats and proteins also affect blood levels of glucose and insulin. So get into the habit of eating lots of fruits and veggies, and trade red meat for fish, nuts, eggs, and beans whenever you can. </p><p>><b>Maintain a healthy weight.</b> When it comes to your weight, the ""fertility zone"" is a body mass index between 20 and 24, Chavarro says. (To calculate your BMI, go to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi"">nhlbisupport.com/bmi</a>).</p><p>In fact, the ASRM estimates that 12 percent of infertility cases are due to weight problems, divided equally between the underweight and overweight. Weigh too much and you have a greater likelihood of irregular periods and ovulation disorders (though even a moderate loss of 5 to 10 percent of your body weight can help kick-start your ovulation); weigh too little and you may not ovulate at all, since body fat triggers the hormones that tell your ovaries to release an egg. </p><p>><b>Move your butt.</b> ""Our research found that 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise each day on most days of the week is related to a lower risk of infertility,"" says Chavarro. If you need an extra push to get there, he suggests adding a mix of strength training, stretching, and aerobic exercise such as biking, hiking, or swimming. Too much exercise, though-anything that brings you to less than 17 percent body fat, or a BMI of 19 or lower-can interfere with ovulation. But unless you're doing an Olympic-level training program, you probably need more exercise, not less. </p><p>><b>Upgrade your water bottle.</b> While you're working up a sweat, you'll work up a thirst-but make sure you swig your water from a BPA-free bottle. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, recently looked at the BPA (bisphenol-A) levels in women undergoing IVF and found a correlation between the level of the chemical in the blood and the ability to conceive. The theory is that BPA, which mimics estrogen, can mess with the balance of hormones in your body. The chemical can be found in the linings of canned goods and sports water bottles, but many companies are now marketing bottles made from safer materials such as stainless steel.</p><p></p><p><b>If you want to get pregnant in one year, do all of the above, plus... </b></p><p>><b>Save your calories for ice cream.</b> Our favorite bit of health news ever. If you add one serving of full-fat dairy to your diet per day, such as whole milk on your cereal instead of skim, you can actually increase your chances of getting pregnant, according to Chavarro's research. There is one caveat, however: ""You have to make adjustments to the rest of your diet so you don't gain weight,"" Chavarro says. He also stresses that this should not be a lifetime change-once there's a bun in your oven, you can go back to drinking skim and eating low-fat fro-yo. </p><p>><b>Rethink your birth control.</b> Now that you're getting closer to wanting a little munchkin, it's time to think about what's kept you from having one in the past. Barrier methods (such as condoms or a diaphragm) are easy: simply stop using them the day you're ready to get pregnant. If you have an IUD, your fertility will return as soon as your doctor takes it out. The same goes for Pill users: Whether you've been taking it for one year or 20, don't believe the rumor that it'll be months before your ovulation revs back up, says Vanessa Cullins, M. D., vice president for medical affairs at Planned Parenthood of America. ""Women may have a few irregular cycles at first, but ovulation can happen within two weeks after you toss your last pack,"" she says. But, Cullins points out, there is one form of birth control that takes time to exit your system before you can get pregnant: If you've had Depo-Provera injections, it can take up to 10 months to become fertile again. </p><p>><b>Cut down on the booze and caffeine.</b> Some studies show that having one to five alcoholic drinks per week can drop your chances of conceiving that month by as much as 50 percent. While other studies have found little connection between moderate drinking and fertility, Chavarro points out that sobriety certainly couldn't hurt, and it might help. And while you're at it, cut back on the triple-shot lattes. While there is no real consensus, some studies suggest that consuming more than 300 milligrams of caffeine a day (about two eight-ounce cups of regular coffee) may increase your risk of endometriosis or fallopian tube problems. </p><p>><b>Reduce stress.</b> ""There's nothing a couple that is trying to get pregnant wants to hear less than 'Relax, you're trying too hard,'"" says Janis Fox, M. D., a fertility specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. But stress can put a damper on fertility by messing with the brain signals that tell your body to ovulate. A study in <i>Human Reproduction</i> showed that couples were more likely to conceive during months they considered themselves relaxed. An effective way to start reducing stress now is to focus on what you appreciate in your life today, says Leslee Kagan, director of women's health at the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine in Boston. Every day, write down three things that you love about your life (No diapers to change! The chance to spend endless, uninterrupted hours reading a great novel!), and take at least 15 minutes to meditate, do yoga, or listen to relaxing music. Believe us, a few years from now, when that baby you waited for is finally here, and you're groggily but happily dealing with colic and diaper rash, these relaxation skills will come in handy! </p>",

Who's getting the rawest deal? Young people. Turns out, a whopping one in three 19- to 29-year-olds has no coverage, the highest uninsured rate of any age-group. Enter the Affordable Care Act, passed in March after decades of stalled efforts. While the bulk of the bill won't be in effect until 2014, you can take advantage of a few important changes right now.</p><p><strong>You Can Stick with Your Parents' Plan</strong><br />So you got a degree and a great gig-but then a pink slip. You might have to beg Mom and Dad for rent money, but they won't have to pitch in for your health insurance. Anyone under 26 can now partake (or reenroll) in their family plan until they find a job with benefits. And that's without tripping over your high school trophies: ""You don't actually have to live with your parents to qualify,"" says U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. ""You can be married or have a job. As long as your employer doesn't offer coverage, you're eligible.""</p><p><strong>Beef Up on Prevention</strong><br />Your routine gyno checkup, your skin exam, your flu shot...these things can really add up. Even if you have health insurance, all those copays and deductibles can be enough to make you relegate preventive care to the back burner. Now you can wrangle costly treatments and services-stuff like vaccines, Pap smears, pregnancy screenings, and cholesterol and diabetes tests-for free if you have a new health plan. (By ""new health plan,"" we mean one you've just signed up for; if you're already covered, your insurer might not have to play by the new rules just yet.) See healthcare.gov for a list of gratis treatments.</p><p><strong>If You're Dropped, You Can Fight Back</strong><br />""Applying for health insurance on your own can be really, really complicated,"" says David Nather, author of <em>The New Health Care System</em>. ""Nobody can remember every little thing they need to report."" Until now, a seemingly innocuous paperwork glitch (as in, you forgot to report that one time your blood pressure or cholesterol spiked) was grounds for dropped coverage-especially if you suddenly and expensively became sick with, say, breast or ovarian cancer. Under the new plan it's illegal for companies to cut you off at your most serious health moments. And if you think you've still been bumped for falling ill, new state-by-state appeal boards will help you with your case.</p><p><strong>Say Bye-Bye to Annual and Lifetime Limits</strong><br />Plans that max out at a certain dollar amount (say, $1 million) aren't a big deal for the fit and healthy, but they are bad news for people who have been in severe accidents or have chronic illnesses. No more: New and renewed plans can no longer impose lifetime dollar limits, and soon there will be minimum benefit rules for things like hospital stays and prescription medications. ""This gets us away from skimpy coverage plans that have these enormous holes you could drive a truck through,"" says Nather. ""Some plans used to say, 'We'll cover up to 30 days in the hospital, but only after the first day.' Of course, all the major expenses occur in that first day.""</p>",
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/tyler-florence-recipes,Nutrition,10,13,5,6,0,32,0,0,,"Tyler Florence: Celeb Chef, Locavore",http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1012-locavore.jpg,"<p>When it comes to food, the people of Marin County, where I live, are pretty darn lucky...and we know it. We have the benefit of living in the heart of California's bounty, and to ignore that would be a crime. So the concept of being a locavore, or one who chooses whenever possible to incorporate locally grown or locally produced food into one's <a href=""/nutrition/the-ultimate-nutrition-plan-0"">nutrition plan</a>, is of great importance.<br /><br /><br /><br />Now, I certainly didn't invent this concept, but over the past few years I've had many discussions with colleagues, friends, and family about what being a locavore means exactly, and how it can best be applied to cooking. And being a locavore doesn't simply stop at addressing the proximity of your food source. Rather, it encompasses, both directly and indirectly, such concepts as sustainability, organic farming, and being ""green,"" among others. This is all important stuff, and as I grow as a chef, a businessman, and a father, the impact of these choices takes on greater and greater significance.<br /><br /><br /><br />Coined by a Bay Area chef and author named Jessica Prentice in 2005, the term locavore has picked up steam in the past few years and, in fact, was chosen by The New Oxford American Dictionary as the 2007 word of the year. This concept has become somewhat political of late, as some critics have called the movement to eat local, organic, and sustainable food an elitist and impractical pursuit.<br /><br /><br /><br />Look, I get it. The best of the best of anything I could ever want to eat literally comes from just around the corner and, thankfully, I have the means to obtain it. But not everyone is so lucky. Organic foods are more expensive-they just are. And if you live in the middle of Nebraska, when February comes, that frozen corn-sicle just isn't going to cut it. So I understand that this concept can seem a bit out of reach for many people.<br /><br /><br /><br />But the truth is that as long as we all recognize the concept and factor it into our food choices, we're on the right path. Let's talk about a few things that make the locavore concept important and worth your time to consider:<br /><br /><br /><br />Locally produced foods-defined as those harvested within a 100-mile radius of one's home-have a lesser impact on the environment because of the decreased need for transportation from source to consumer. Another plus for local foods is that they are generally of superior quality because they get to the consumer very shortly after harvest.<br /><br /><br /><br />Eating local foods also supports local economies, keeping the money cycling through the community. It's important that our restaurants not only delight our community's collective palate but also enrich the lives of our neighbors.<br /><br /><br /><br />When people turn to local foods, the benefits are felt up and down the food chain, and even if you don't live in a place where you can take full advantage of the idea, I encourage you to think about ways that you can apply the same principles to your family's dinner table. Despite the controversies-organic versus local, and sustainable versus cost-effective-the bottom line is that we'd all benefit from a locavore way of life. Even if it isn't completely practical for your household all the time, there are pieces of the concept that you can take away, wherever you live.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Hungry for More?</b><br /><br /><br />Excerpted from <i>Tyler Florence Family Meal: Bringing People Together Never Tasted Better</i>, by Tyler Florence (Rodale 2010).

As much an art form as it is a skill, ""it's a sneaky way to <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/time-management-strategies"">get what you want out of work</a>,"" says Nicole Williams, author of <i>Girl on Top: Your Guide to Turning Dating Rules into Career Success</i>. So whether you have an awesome boss or a wicked one, here's how to work some magic on the person who controls your job satisfaction.</p><p><strong>Act Like Her Mini-Me</strong><br />Imitating your boss's work style is one of the best (not to mention one of the simplest) ways to make it seem as if you can read her mind and show her you're both on the same wavelength. For example, does she like to keep e-mails brief? Don't send her messages that are five paragraphs long. Is she a big-picture kind of woman? Offer details in a way that emphasizes their relevance to the company's larger mission. ""If you give your boss exactly what she wants, in the format she would have presented it herself, she'll think you're just like her,"" explains Williams. ""And as narcissistic as that might sound, most of us tend to be drawn to people who are most like us."" </p><p><strong>Be Her Inside Source</strong><br />Bosses wonder what the mood is like behind cubicle walls and in the break room. Problem is, the further up the ladder they go, the less feedback they get. So she'll appreciate your filling her in when the troops are frustrated, confused, or just plain pissed. Keep in mind that ""you need to be careful when it comes to sharing this kind of information,"" warns Williams. ""If you're trying to get on your boss's good side by ratting out someone else, you'll come off as a tattler. But if you catch her when she's alone and talk to her about the office vibe in a nonconfrontational way, it will help her feel clued in."" </p><p><strong>Make Your Boss Look Good to Her Boss</strong><br />""Help her accomplish what she needs to do in order to be successful and your efforts will come back to help you in the end,"" says career strategist J.T. O'Donnell, author of <em>Careerealism: The Smart Approach to a Satisfying Career</em>. For example, if the head honcho of the company requests a weekly ideas memo from your manager, do some brainstorming every Monday and send her a brief e-mail with your thoughts. Just remember: When your boss gets kudos for your ideas, be content to let her bask in all the glory (even though you might feel like standing on your swivel chair and screaming, ""Hey, that was all me!""). ""Just remind yourself that your boss knows the role you played in helping her look good,"" says career coach Dan Schawbel, author of <em>Me 2.0: 4 Steps to Building Your Future</em>. ""That means you'll eventually be rewarded too."" </p><p><strong>Play by Her Rules</strong><br />Even if you're positive you can plow through your long to-do list with a few Google Chat windows open on your computer screen, your boss may view your instant messaging as slacking, especially if she's a Gen Xer (read: in her thirties or forties) or older. ""Whether you like it or not, your boss is comparing your work ethic with her own,"" explains career expert Lindsey Pollak, a spokesperson for LinkedIn and the author of <em>Getting from College to Career: 90 Things to Do Before You Join the Real World</em>. A key way to make this work for you: Focus in on how your boss paid her dues and be willing to do the same. For instance, if you're a teacher and you find out that your principal coached three extracurricular sports when she had your job, volunteer to supervise some after-school clubs. Or, if your manager likes to reminisce about how she took on the most heinous shifts when she first started out, you might volunteer for a few graveyard hours each month. </p><p><strong>Suck Up</strong><br />Yeah, you read that right. </p><p>""If you don't kiss up, you'll stall your career. It's really that simple,"" says Penelope Trunk, author of <em>Brazen Careerist: The New Rules for Success</em>. But here's the catch: It has to be a subtle form of flattery, and it has to be authentic. Rather than tossing a bunch of sugarcoated compliments her way-which, let's face it, can sound completely bogus-ask for your boss's advice. ""It's a way to show that you really admire her work, respect her opinion, and want to learn,"" says Schawbel. ""You were hired for the 'hard skills' that enable you to do your job,"" says Trunk. ""But you'll be promoted for the 'soft skills' that make people like you."" </p><p><strong>Learn to Say No</strong><br />It's OK to say no in the workplace-but it's important to be judicious about who you say it to. Turning down colleagues' requests to work on things that aren't all that meaningful to your boss will help her see that you're focused on her needs, notes Trunk. And if your boss throws you more work than you can possibly handle, don't freak; just ask what you should prioritize. ""We tend to commit to more than what we can realistically do because we want to please our managers,"" says O'Donnell. ""But your boss will trust you with harder work-and more of it-if you exceed her expectations every time. And you just can't do that if you're overwhelmed.""</p>",

With his sexy grin and good-guy charm, we only wish he'd ditch Hollywood and work in our office. Alas, with another big role on the way -- next spring he'll co-star with George Clooney in <i>Leatherheads</i>, a comedy about 1920s football -- he won't be jamming our copy machines anytime soon. We're doubly impressed that he recently adapted a David Foster Wallace short story for the big screen. The indie flick <i>Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</i> (which he also directed and acted in) follows an anthropologist as she quizzes men about sex and love. Given that, we figured he'd be willing to field a few questions himself.<br /><br /><b>We asked...</b><br /><br /><b>What's the one thing women need to know about men?</b><br />We can appear to be tough as nails, but guys have a level of insecurity and vulnerability that's exponentially bigger than you think.

I taught English in Costa Rica before I went to college.

Then he hears that Sarah or whoever's going to be there. Suddenly he gets up off the couch, stretches, and says, ""Oh, I guess I'll go.""

But these days the shelves are packed with products bearing the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) round green ""Organic"" label - and a heftier price tag. Something about the word ""organic"" automatically implies a pure, healthy, overall better-for-you product. But is <a href=""http://eatthis.womenshealthmag.com/content/truth-about-organic-food"">organic food better</a>? Will eating Paul Newman's Newman-Os instead of regular cookies shrink your waistline - or just your checking account? Will a kitchen stocked with organic snacks make your kids healthier or just more prone to wear hemp? And does the world really need organic wine? <br /><br />To find out, we interviewed a slew of doctors, scientists, nutritionists, and chefs. The consensus: Some <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/organic-foods"">organic foods</a> are worth the extra money because they've been proven safer, tastier, and more nutritious than the conventionally grown kinds. But they won't make you thin or guarantee good health for life. Others you can leave on the shelf; even though they may be slightly better for you, they're not so much better that they're worth paying extra for. After examining all sides, we've put together a definitive list of 19 foods - fruits, vegetables, meats, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/benefits-of-eggs"">dairy,</a> and more - that deserve the splurge, and 13 that don't. Between the brass tacks and the grass roots, we've got organic figured out. And don't miss <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/premium-packaged-foods"">WH's 125 Best Packaged Foods,</a> to scoop up tips for brezzing through the supermarket aisles, and our <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/the-ultimate-nutrition-plan"">Ultimate Meal Plan</a> for all-day energy and clarity. <br /><br /><b>The Pesticide Problem</b><br /><br />When you wheel past the organic section of the produce aisle, no doubt you start thinking a little harder about those tomatoes you picked up a few paces back. Suddenly all nonorganic fruits and vegetables seem tainted by horrible, bug-killing chemicals, and you can't help but wonder what all those foreign substances are doing to your body. Well, easy does it: Not all conventionally grown produce is coated in the stuff. That said, we don't know what the long-term effects are of consuming any amount of pesticides. What we do know is that for certain people, pesticides are dangerous.<br /><br />Consider a widely used category of bug killers with an appropriately nasty name: chlorpyrifos. The Environmental Protection Agency calls them the most potentially harmful kind of pesticide. Older kids and adults can safely detoxify chlorpyrifos using an enzyme called PON-1. But children under the age of 2 have much lower levels of this enzyme, which means their bodies are exposed to up to 165 times more of the stuff than ours are, says Alan Greene, M.D., pediatrician and founder of DrGreene.com, an award-winning pediatric-care Web site. <br /><br />Pregnant women should also be careful. Doctors used to think pesticides did not pass through the placenta, but new studies have found evidence that they do - and that prenatal exposure to chemicals can have serious results. A study released in April 2004 by scientists at the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Washington showed that babies who had been exposed to pesticides in utero (that is, through food their mothers ate) were more likely to be born prematurely and have abnormal reflexes. A study from Columbia University found that fetuses who were exposed to these chemicals in bug-spray form were born with smaller heads than babies who were not exposed. Yet another study found a connection between pesticide exposure in utero and abnormal _neurological exams - a good predictor of behavioral problems like attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity down the road. Bottom line: It makes sense for pregnant women and children under 2 to avoid conventionally grown fruits and vegetables that contain high levels of pesticides. And the rest of us? If you can afford to buy everything on our ""Worth It"" list, go for it. But if you're not pregnant, there's no reason to lose sleep about the level of pesticides in your foods. ""When we look at the best estimates of an adult's typical exposure on a daily basis over the course of a lifetime, it's generally 10,000 times lower than levels we feed lab animals - and we don't see measurable negative effects in the animals,"" says Carl Winter, Ph.D., food toxicologist and director of the FoodSafe program at the University of California at Davis. <br /><br /><b>How Bad Are Hormones and Antibiotics?</b><br /><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/benefits-of-grass-fed-beef"">Organic meat,</a> dairy, and eggs are healthier than the regular varieties because of what they don't contain - namely, the hormones and anti_biotics given to conventionally raised livestock. <br /><br />Farmers often give synthetic hormones, including estrogen, to animals so they can produce more milk or more eggs and grow faster. This practice has prompted some to blame synthetic estrogen in animal products for the early onset of puberty in girls. However, there's little research to bear this out. On average, menstruation today begins just 2 1/2 months earlier than it did 25 years ago - and estrogen in animals may not be the culprit. More likely, obesity and other factors are to blame, researchers say. <br /><br />If you really want to get worked up about something, it should be antibiotics. The close living quarters in which most farm animals are raised encourage the rampant spread of infection, so farmers often lace their feed with antibiotics to keep the animals healthy. Farmers have also found that anti-biotics increase growth in animals - yet another incentive to use them.<br /><br />Problem is the bacteria that survive a dose of antibiotics only grow stronger. And when you eat those meats, eggs, or cheeses, that stuff enters your body too. That means the next time you have a bacterial infection, there's a greater chance the antibiotics prescribed by your doc won't work.<br /><br />Reaching for organic milk, yogurt, cheese, eggs, and meat is a certain way to avoid excess antibiotics and hormones. If you have trouble finding these products, look for beef that's labeled ""pasture-raised,"" ""grass-fed,"" or ""natural."" Also look for meat or dairy products labeled ""hormone-free"" or ""antibiotic-free,"" which may not conform to all organic standards but will not have added medications. And take note: The government doesn't regulate these claims as carefully as it does ""organic,"" so organic is still the gold standard. <br /><br /><b>Growing More Nutrients </b><br /><br />If you're the type who opts for a bag of pretzels - or worse - over a helping of spinach, going organic should get you more of the vitamins and _minerals you need. In 2001, nutritionist Virginia Worthington, Ph.D., compared the nutritional value of organic fruits, vegetables, and grains with conventional ones. She found that organic crops contain greater amounts of magnesium (29 percent more than conventional crops), vitamin C (27 percent), iron (21 percent), and phosphorus (14 percent). Dr. Worthington thinks the synthetic fertilizers used on conventional crops may cause them to soak up excess nitrate, which lowers the production of vitamin C and other good-for-you compounds.<br /><br />You've heard all the good things about the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/antioxidants-fight-aging"">power of antioxidants,</a> which help ward off heart disease, Alzheimer's, and other inflammation-related illnesses. On average, organic produce is 30 percent higher in antioxidants, says Charles Benbrook, Ph.D., chief scientist of the Organic Center, a nonprofit clearinghouse for research. Organic corn seems to be the star: Researchers found that it contains up to 50 percent more antioxidants than conventional corn. The ""why"" is simple: When a plant doesn't have pesticides and chemicals to help fight off disease, it develops stronger natural compounds to protect itself. And you gain those same benefits when you consume the plant. <br /><br />In the animal category, research shows that cattle that eat grass (as many organic cows do) produce beef lower in total fat than cattle fed a grain diet. What's more, grass-fed beef and milk can contain as much as two to three times the amount of omega-3 fatty acids in the regular kind. These omega-3s have been known to boost good HDL cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease.<br /><br /><b>The Taste Test</b><br /><br />Think of a juicy, tender organic tomato, rich in color and flavor. It's way tastier than your average pale tomato. Most conventional produce is picked before ripening so it can survive the trip on a semitruck to a supermarket across the country. Most organic food is grown locally and available only in season, so it travels less and has more time to develop flavor on the vine. What's more, organic farmers frequently grow ""heirloom"" versions of tomatoes and other crops that have been bred for taste, not toughness.<br /><br />Likewise, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/chicken-recipes"">organic chicken</a> is much less rubbery than your run-of-the-mill bird, thanks to higher-quality feed and extra room to roam. And if you've ever done a side-by-side comparison of organic and nonorganic milk, you know that, at the same fat content, the former tastes far fuller and richer. Experts say this difference is due to the varied diet of most organic cows: Eating grass in addition to standard feed boosts their milk's flavor.<br /><br />Which is why more and more chefs - and consumer foodies - are cooking with organic ingredients. Organic food still accounts for only 2 percent of the food industry, but sales are shooting up at a rate of 16 percent a year. ""Most of the time, organic foods are grown with more care, and you can really taste that,"" says Akasha Richmond, author of <i>Hollywood Dish</i> and cofounding chef of Eaturnia, an organic catering company in Los Angeles. ""Fruit in particular - there's a huge difference. The taste is much richer, much deeper, much cleaner.""<br /><br /><b>What Price Organic? </b><br /><br />While there's huge variation in how much more organic foods cost than their conventionally grown counterparts, you'll wind up paying around 50 percent more, on average. And let's face it - unless you're loaded, that can be a problem. Even though Richmond loves buying organic for her family, ""If it's too expensive, I won't,"" she says. To keep costs down, she shops for organic fruits and vegetables only when they're in season - and therefore cheaper. <br /><br />The good news: Experts predict that the cost of organic food will soon start to decline, thanks in part to monster retailers interested in capitalizing on the nation's new hunger for organic products. Increased mass-market interest encourages more land to be farmed organically, intensifying competition and lowering prices. Wal-Mart, for instance, has announced plans to sell organic food for just 10 percent more than food grown the regular way. <br /><br />But in the end, if an extra 35 cents or 75 cents or even a dollar is guaranteed to give you healthier food that delivers more flavor with every bite...well, giving up that next pair of cute little slingbacks just might be worth it.<br />","cooking,Go Green"

But on an otherwise ordinary afternoon, a scathing missive arrived from one of my best pals: a litany of my flaws and mistakes, along with my most mortifying secrets, amassed over the years we'd known each other and thrown back in my face.<br /><br />What prompted this vicious e-mail attack? A friendship I'd struck up with someone my close friend-unbeknownst to me-had a brutal grudge against.<p></p><p>For days afterward, I walked around dazed, alternating between grief over our falling-out and a growing anger at her cruel words. But I didn't realize which of the two feelings was stronger until my phone rang weeks later. Sounding humbled, she asked if we could talk.</p><p>I considered her request for all of three seconds...then hung up.</p><p><b>Getting Your Grudge On</b><br />In a perfect world, everyone would be high-minded enough to move past petty pals, scheming coworkers, and lyin', cheatin' mates. But when someone you love and trust hurts you, it's like taking a sucker punch to your emotional six-pack.<br /><br />Withholding forgiveness is a way of doling out justice and letting the other person know that his or her bad behavior has repercussions. But consider this: Forgiveness isn't just good for your soul, it can be good for your health too. According to research that appeared in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine, people with more forgiving personalities tend to have less stress, lower blood pressure, better sleep quality, less depression, and stronger immune systems to boot. Maybe that's because carrying a grudge is kind of like walking around with a 20-pound weight on your shoulders: The only person who is really being punished is you. ""People think forgiveness is an act of kindness toward another person,"" explains Marina Cantacuzino, founder and director of The Forgiveness Project, an international organization that is devoted to fostering a culture of nonretribution. ""But it isn't-you do it primarily for yourself.""</p><p><b>The Slow-Burn Bygone</b><br />Even so, that doesn't mean it's always smart to wipe the slate clean. ""Painful events happen to all of us, and we can become attached to the pain and unable to move past it,"" says Harriet Lerner, Ph.D., author of The Dance of Anger. ""But letting go of the corrosive fury that's ruining an otherwise good day does not mean you have to forgive the person who harmed you or excuse their behavior. Sure, you need to move forward, but you don't need to forgive someone to heal.""<br /><br />Psychologist Jeanne Safer, Ph.D., author of Forgiving and Not Forgiving: A New Approach to Resolving Intimate Betrayal, agrees: ""It's fine not to forgive, and if you do decide to do it, there's no hurry."" In fact, rushing into what she calls ""fake forgiveness""-that urge to wrap up an unpleasant episode ASAP-can actually lead to physical repercussions. Case in point: Research suggests a connection between repressed anger, stress, and blood pressure levels.<br /><b>Who Deserves a Pardon?</b><br />Bad behavior isn't always black and white, so how do you know when it's wise to take the path of forgiveness? Experts say one thing to weigh is intent. What was the motive of the person who wronged you? Did she do it to hurt or embarrass you, or was she acting more out of weakness or cluelessness? Take a pal who reveals a confidence. Did she blurt out your indiscretion because she had one too many appletinis? Or did she do it intentionally to stir up some drama?<br /><br />Another thing to consider: Is the other person genuinely contrite, or is he just looking to relieve his guilty conscience? Finally, how important is the person in your life? Is the mistake heinous enough to scrap years of friendship? If you believe the relationship is important enough to salvage, here are a few tricks for letting go of your grievances:</p><p><i>Hash it out.</i><br />Even if you're willing to forgive the other person, you can't truly start fresh unless you confront her. Let her know what hurt you, ask for an explanation, and get assurances that it won't happen again. And-this is important-be sure you really are over it so you don't end up throwing the ""And what about that time..."" mistake in her face during a future argument.<br /><br /><i>But first, plan it out.</i><br />Before confronting the person, you may want to write down your grievances and then enlist a friend to help you practice different ways of talking about them. At a sticky point in her life, Beliefnet blogger Therese Borchard scribbled down her feelings toward her often-absent father-basically, ""a laundry list of what he did wrong""-then read it aloud to her best friend. She was then able to talk to her dad about it in a less confrontational way, which ultimately helped them mend fences and move on.<br /><br /><i>Avoid the scene of the crime.</i><br />Use an ""out of sight, out of mind"" strategy. ""You have to walk through the fire to be done with an experience,"" says Frederic Luskin, Ph.D., director of the Stanford University Forgiveness Project and author of Forgive for Good. ""But too many people stay in the fire. You have to get out of that grieving, miserable place."" So even if you choose to continue your relationship with the person who wronged you, avoid stuff that triggers resentment (e.g., rereading old e-mails) so you're not constantly reliving the hurt.<br /><br /><i>Try a little empathy.</i><br />A study conducted by Cleveland's Case Western Reserve University shows that people tend to be more forgiving when they see themselves as being capable of committing an action similar to their offender's; it makes the offense seem smaller. ""Most people who injure you have had their own bumps in the road,"" says Robert Enright, Ph.D., a professor of educational psychology at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and author of Forgiveness Is a Choice. When you begin to see the humanity on the other side, it can help you to understand-and bear-what happened.<br /><br /><i>Look at it as pain with a purpose.</i><br />Nobody signs up to get hurt, but you might as well get something out of the experience, right? ""Finding meaning in how you've suffered-for example, realizing you stayed too long in a relationship-helps you move on, and that can be empowering,"" explains Enright. ""Without even realizing it, your anxiety level starts going down.""<br /><br />Remember, when someone's done something deplorable, it's appropriate to be angry and to use caution so the same thing doesn't happen again. But when you are able to move on, it can feel incredibly freeing.<br /></p>",friendship

So why does one lousy fight with your boyfriend land you elbow-deep in a tub of <a href=""http://origin.www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/whats-for-dinner-0"">mac 'n cheese</a>? Maybe because a dieter's worst enemy isn't temptation; it's a really foul mood.</p><p>""Emotional eating is the number-one reason most diets fail,"" says Linda Spangle, R.N., M.A., a Denver-based <a href=""/weight-loss"">weight-loss</a> coach and the author of <i>100 Days of Weight Loss</i>. Spangle estimates that up to 75 percent of her clients overeat because of how they feel. ""They have a bad day and self-medicate with food,"" she says.</p><p>Researchers at the Miriam Hospital's Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center in Providence, Rhode Island, agree. In a 2007 study, they found that internal emotional triggers pose a larger obstacle to weight loss than external ones (e.g., eating more because dinner is served buffet-style). </p><p>Now there's physiological evidence to back up what you've always instinctively known: Women really are more prone to day-from-hell food fixes than men. In a study published earlier this year, researchers at the Brookhaven National Laboratory had normal-weight male and female volunteers fast for nearly 20 hours, then tempted them with their favorite foods. The volunteers were instructed to resist the food while imaging equipment took photos of their brain activity. The resulting scans showed that while all the volunteers could consciously suppress their hunger somewhat, the brain areas that regulate emotions and the motivation to eat were more active in the women than in the men.</p><p>So if we're able to will our hunger pangs into submission, why don't we? For one thing, because our emotional attachment to that box of doughnuts, unlike the one we have to Clive Owen, isn't all in our head-our emotions can in fact trigger physical hunger. ""There's definitely a physical component to emotional eating,"" says Susan Kraus, R.D., a nutritionist at Hackensack University Medical Center. ""The mood- and appetite-regulating chemicals in your brain like to stay in balance. So when you experience unpleasant emotions that throw off that balance, your brain will try to compensate.""</p><p>When you have an evil day, your brain's production of serotonin (a neurotransmitter that keeps you from feeling anxious and depressed) can drop. Studies link low levels of serotonin in women to irritability and increased appetite. Further, research has shown that the things that cause low serotonin-including exhaustion, stress, PMS, and lack of sleep and sex-hit women harder than men because women start out with about 25 percent less of the chemical, according to Robert Posner, M.D., co­author of <i>Stress Eater Die</i>t.</p><p>To maintain its proper levels, your brain issues an order for carbohydrates, which contain the amino acid tryptophan, a building block of serotonin. That's why, after spending an hour in traffic on the way home from work, you want to scarf a slice of pizza, not grilled chicken and steamed broccoli. When you do, your body pumps out more serotonin, which takes the edge off almost instantly-until your body finishes processing the carbs. Then comes the dreaded rebound, when your blood sugar plummets and you end up craving another slice. </p><p>Are you really hungry? Probably not, though it sure feels that way. In fact, the most common time to binge is after a meal, says Mary Boggiano, Ph.D., an associate professor of psychology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who has studied overeating in rats. ""Hunger is actually the least reported reason for overeating,"" she says. Low serotonin can also impair your ability to tell when you're full, making you more likely to eat when you don't really need to as well as more prone to overeating. </p><p>What's more, if you do tend to eat for comfort, being low on serotonin will probably make it harder for you to resist the foods you love. That's because dwindling levels have been linked to an increased sensitivity to reward. Translation: ""Emotional eaters eat not only to reduce stress but also because it feels so much better than what they're going through,"" Boggiano says. Add brain chemistry to the emotional associations formed throughout life-like getting a lollipop every time you scraped your knee-and it's no wonder you feel helpless to resist that carton of Rocky Road. </p><p>""It takes time, but you can change the way you react,"" says Linda Hlivka, a clinical nutritionist and Posner's co-author on <i>Stress Eater Diet</i>. And that doesn't mean you can never treat yourself. ""If you decide you want to relax with a few cookies and can stop at three, that's probably not emotional eating,"" Hlivka says. ""When it becomes your go-to stress-reduction strategy-like, 10 times a day-it's a problem.""</p><p> </p><p><a href=""/weight-loss/suppress-cravings"">6 Ways to Beat Mindless Munching </a></p>","perfect skin,Celebrities"

In fact, she has an entourage of exactly one--her tour manager, Nick Cua--when she arrives at a hotel in Birmingham, England (where she's on tour), for her <i>Women's Health</i> interview. ""She can take care of herself,"" Cua says. Kind of what you'd expect from the fearless 30-year-old singer who burst onto the music scene almost a decade ago by crashing a motorbike into her cheating ex's apartment in her ""There You Go"" video--and the brave soul who reportedly ripped into Kanye West at the MTV Video Music Awards after he obnoxiously robbed Taylor Swift of her Moonman-winning moment last September.</p><p>But the five-foot-three firecracker who emerges from the dressing room in a curve-cradling designer dress couldn't be sweeter or more polite, thanking the <i>Women's Health</i> team for choosing her to be on the cover because ""I've worked hard for this body!"" Oh, yes, that body. Should you need inspiration to break out of the tedium of your treadmill routine, you'd do well to get to a Pink concert pronto for a close-up look at the performer's fantastic new physique, as showcased in barely-there costumes. You'll leave itching to hit an all-night fitness club after the encore. But the artist behind the Cirque du Soleil-style stunts (at the 2009 VMAs, Pink sang upside down, dangling by one leg from a trapeze) is also a woman to be admired for many other reasons. Behold the kind of honesty that is rarely exhibited by a major star, as Pink talks about the power of performing in front of a crowd of thousands, enduring a yearlong separation from her husband, and how ramping up her workout helped restore her confidence.</p><p><b>First things first: is it Pink or Alecia?</b><br />Alecia's cool.</p> <p><b>Is Pink your version of Sasha Fierce [Beyonce's alter ego]?</b><br />[Laughs] No! Pink is just me. Chi-Chi Marie is my Sasha Fierce. My girlfriends in New York named me that. All of their middle names are Marie. Mine's Beth, but to them I'm Chi-Chi Marie.</p><p><b>You've always been buff, but your body is hotter than ever. You're a total 10!</b><br />No, no, no! I feel like a seven and a half!</p> <p><b>Please. At the show last night, we were like, ""Look at her butt, her biceps, and those abs!""</b><br />My man abs? They're pretty full-on. It's like that D'Angelo video [for ""How Does It Feel""]; he's got that V. I get a lot of flak for it. That's where the masculine thing comes in, people saying it's not normal for a girl to have [those]. But I'm OK with it. I think it's because I was a gymnast for eight years, from ages 4 to 12. My body was made before my bones were fully grown. Gymnasts are short, stocky, muscular powerhouses.</p><p><b>You had an androgynous look in the past, but your look is more feminine now. You wear pink lip gloss, your body is leaner, you lost 20 pounds. What's behind this new softer side?</b><br />Last year, when I was going through my separation [from competitive motocross racer Carey Hart], I was in Malibu running every day just to keep from burying myself in the sand--to get out, feel the ocean. You've got to make yourself feel good at times like that. Even if it's a pain in the ass and you hate working out, the endorphins and the stress you bring down [help]. You feel strong, healthy. You feel good about yourself, your jeans fit.</p> <p><b>You two are back together, and you thank Carey before anyone else in the <i>Funhouse </i>liner notes, saying ""You took my heart and made it bigger."" But when you were making the CD, weren't you really pissed at him? Isn't that what ""So what"" is about? </b><br />No. I wasn't. [Big sigh] Long-term relationships are a layered onion. There's something about him I love, and I want him to be OK, even if he's not with me.</p> <p><b>How is that different from past relationships?</b><br />When I met Carey, I was an abused puppy in the corner, ready to bite anyone who put their hand out. And there's a part of me who will always be kind of like that. But he was the first man I was with who allowed me to take a deep breath [she exhales] and close my eyes and fall backward. And most of the time, he was there. That's more than I can say about others. So when I say he took my heart and made it bigger, my heart was like this clenched fist. And even after he broke my heart, still, I had two bigger halves. I have more capacity to love and to be loved.</p> <p><b>You've been touring for more than a year now. How do you stay fit on the road?</b><br />Ever hear of [the workout videos] P90X? My brother and his wife are both in the Air Force; they do marathons and triathlons. I went to visit and [she was doing P90X]. I couldn't keep up with her--and she'd just had her first baby four weeks before. I was like, <i>This is bullshit! I will perfect this thing! </i>So usually, I wake up and do an hour of cardio, then an hour of P90X or yoga, then a half-hour of warm-up [during show rehearsal]. I do that six days a week.</p><p><b>And on the seventh day, she rests?</b><br />Yeah. I try to make it a show day so I'm still getting cardio. I have to be able to run up those stairs as many times as I do and be able to sing at the same time. I'm an asthmatic. I have to be on that treadmill singing to get my lungs right.</p><p><b>Do you like working out?</b><br />I like results. I like feeling strong. It keeps my mental floor higher.</p><p><b>You don't have a personal trainer?</b><br />No. I don't work well with trainers. [Air quotes] ""Does not work well with others.""</p><p><b>Didn't you get kicked off the gymnastics team as a kid?</b><br />Yeah. I was told, ""It's not an individual sport.""</p><p><b>You used to show off by doing 18 backflips in a row. How many can you do now?</b><br />[In a sad baby voice] Two. I separated my shoulder the night before my U.S. tour started. </p> <p><b>Which is why you have taken a break performing on the trapeze while singing ""Sober""? That was one of the highlights of the MTV Video Music Awards. </b><br />It took everything in me to get through those [U.S.] shows. I was in so much pain that there was just no way. It was the first time I ever took a pain pill onstage. I don't even take Tylenol; I'm scared to mix two Advil. For Philly [she grew up in nearby Doylestown, Pennsylvania], I wanted to do the trapeze routine so badly, but I just couldn't. I know my body. The last thing I want is for two, five, 10 years from now, not to be able to pick up my child because I was stubborn. I did it on television. I proved to myself that I could do it in the first place. And the show looks beautiful without it.</p> <p><b>You allegedly quit smoking...</b><br />Smoking isn't cute at all. [I started when I] was 9. It's awful. I hate the smell, the taste. I hate being around people when I smoke. I hate everything about it. I'm an asthmatic singing smoker! But for some reason, I look at it as the last remaining bit of me before all of this [fame and success]. I've definitely cut way back. At night, when I'm out drinking my wine, I'll have cigarettes rationed to me. But I don't smoke at home.</p> <p><b><i>American Idol</i>'s Adam Lambert went nuts when you sang ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" at your L.A. show. Are you a fan? </b><br />I've never been into <i>American Idol</i>. I'd love a show where people can get up onstage and do their own stuff.</p> <p><b>Your tour is the Funhouse. Britney's tour is the Circus...</b><br />I'm not taking anything away from Britney because I really like her a lot, but I would never go to a show where the person was lip-synching. When you grow up listening to Janis Joplin, you're not going to want to see somebody mime.</p><p><b>You like Britney? Isn't she one of the girls you sing about in ""Stupid Girls""? </b><br />I've always said I like Britney. I swear to God, I've stuck up for Britney since the beginning. She and I have talked about it. My point was, ""Stop comparing me to her, because we're different animals.""</p><p><b>This Summer you're playing stadium shows across the U.K., Which is a huge deal. But isn't it hard being away from home in L.A. for such a long time?</b><br />I'm a performer. I sing my life. It's like I'm having group therapy 350 days a year, and the people who come to the show get that, and they're there for that--whether it's to be lifted up, or to be lifted out, or just entertained or inspired, or to feel not so alone. That's how I feel when I'm singing my songs: These people are all going through the same things I am. I'm not alone either. I'm getting something out of it too.</p><p><b>We started this interview by establishing that you hope your body rates a seven and a half. But with all the months of serious workouts to come, isn't it possible you'll make it to a 10?</b><br />[Cracks up] If they figure out how to stretch me and make me a little bit taller, then maybe I'll get upwards of eight. </p><p><b>More Pink:</b><br />Behind the scenes in our January/February cover shoot:<br /> </p><p> </p> <p><br />Also, congrats to Pink for leaving us all breathless with her showstopping (and athletic!) <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Jp5laTack"">Grammy performance</a>.</p><p> </p>",Pink

Then increase the resistance by one level (or 2 percent) for 1 minute. Return to your warmup pace for 1 minute. Then up the resistance two levels (4 percent) for another minute and recover at warmup pace for 1 minute. Continue this pattern, increasing your resistance each time, until you reach an intensity at which you can no longer huff out words (or you hit the maximum resistance on the machine). Aim for 6 intervals. Then begin dropping your intervals the same way, minute-by-minute, until you're back where you started.

That 3:1 ratio is important: Some studies show that eating too many omega-6s and not enough omega-3s may negate the positive health effects.

I was out late with friends again last night. We go out three or four times a week--hey, I'm 26 and single!<br /><b>Bingham says </b>Ragni has to make a habit of fueling up before exercising or she'll be ravenous afterward. One smart option would be <b>half of a whole-wheat English muffin with all-natural peanut butter or half of a banana.</b> Breakfast will make a huge difference in her energy level and reduce later cravings. <br /><b>Glor says</b> Ragni likes to get in and out of the gym fast, so multitasking moves, like a bicep curl/lunge combo, will work every major muscle group, raise her heart rate, and get her workout over quickly.</p><p><b>9 a.m. </b>Grab a cup of coffee with nonfat milk and one whole-grain waffle with sugar-free syrup and a vegetarian sausage patty. I try to start my day out healthy because I know I'll stuff myself later. I tend to fall off the wagon on weekends.<br /><b>MB</b> Good choices--pairing protein and carbs helps that full feeling last longer. For lean protein in the morning, she could also try:<b><br /></b></p><ul><li><b>an omelet with two or three egg whites</b></li><li><b>1/2 cup low-fat cottage cheese</b></li></ul><p><b>10 a.m.</b> Down another cup of coffee and about four glasses of water. I drink a lot at my desk all day so I won't get hungry and snack. <br /><b>MB</b> Drinking water is good, but Ragni can't rely on liquids alone--hunger will creep up on her with a vengeance. When it hits her she should have one of these snacks:</p><ul><li><b>a handful of peanuts, almonds, or pistachios</b></li><li><b>low-fat yogurt with a couple of graham crackers</b></li><li><b>a Fiber One granola bar </b></li><li><b>multigrain crackers with two tablespoons of hummus</b></li></ul><p><br /><b>2:45 p.m.</b> For lunch, I hit the salad bar at the deli next door. I go overboard with cheese, black beans, grilled chicken, and ranch dressing--people laugh and ask if I want any lettuce with my croutons. Still, it's fast and easy and makes me feel as if I'm eating something healthy. <br /><b>MB</b> Her dipping energy levels are making her crave carbs, which explains the crouton obsession. A <b>whole-wheat roll or a piece of multigrain bread </b>would be better. This meal is not as good as she thinks it is: Ranch dressing is loaded with calories and saturated fat. Almost any other kind would be better. She should switch to low-fat ranch or Italian or to vinaigrette; she should also gradually decrease how much she uses. And she needs to bulk up on veggies, even if they're part of a sandwich. Try <b><a target=""_blank"" href=""/weight-loss/lose-weight-with-foods-that-burn-fat"">turkey</a>, lettuce, tomato, and avocado with mustard or light mayo on a whole-wheat wrap or pita. </b></p><p><b>4:50 p.m.</b> Last night is catching up with me again; snag a medium nonfat latte. <br /><b>MB</b> Ragni should limit herself to two cups of java a day and give her body a boost with food instead. One of the snacks mentioned above or <b>whole-grain crackers and an apple with two tablespoons of reduced-fat peanut butter </b>would perk her up. </p><p><b>6 p.m. </b>Happy hour--now this is what I've been saving up calories for! After two vodka and diet Cokes, I attack a plate of nachos, BBQ wings, and then more nachos. <br /><b>MB </b>Saving calories for happy hour might seem like a good strategy, but she's filling up on alcohol, sugar, and fat and missing the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and even basic protein, healthy fat, and complex carbs her body needs. She should have something healthy beforehand, like <b>a grilled chicken breast sandwich on multigrain bread with honey mustard,</b> so she doesn't feel tempted to pig out on foods devoid of nutrition. And she needs to enlist her friends' help to avoid greasy bar food and pizza pit stops. Without support from people around you, you're setting yourself up to fail.</p><p><b>9:30 p.m. </b>Still going strong: I down two more vodka and Diet Cokes before last call. <br /><b>MB</b> All those drinks add up. Even with diet soda as a mixer, she's drinking about 250 empty calories. Ragni has a choice to make that won't be easy for her: Go out less often or drink less when she is out. If she cuts back to one or two alcoholic drinks a night and flanks them with lime and seltzers, she may find she can drink less and still have a great time. </p><p><b>Bottom line</b> Ragni skimps on food all day and then goes crazy at night. She should redistribute calories so she's eating about every four hours to fuel her body. Her energy will be higher and her body will actually be more efficient at burning calories when it's not hit with an excess of fat and calories all at once during happy hour. </p><p><b>Ragni's take </b>I have a hard time regulating drinks when I'm out, so I'm focusing on eating more healthy food throughout the day, which is definitely giving me more energy and making it easier not to eat late at night. My friends help by not ­offering to share their wings or fries and by cheering me on when I make it to the end of the night without eating any junk. My biggest problem is consistency. After four weeks, I've fallen back into some old patterns, but I'm trying to stick to it.</p><p><b>The Comfort-Food Craver</b></p><p><b>Name </b>Jenai Cohen<br /><b>Age</b> 34<br /><b>Hometown</b> Manchester, MA<br /><b>Occupation</b> Part-time ER doctor<br /><b>Height</b> 5'1"" <br /><b>Starting weight</b> 127 <br /><b>Goal weight</b> 117 <br /><b>Biggest challenge</b> Her erratic work schedule and 17-month-old son, Josh, leave Cohen with little time for balanced meals. <br /><b><br />The Pros</b><br /><b>Keri Gans, M.S., R.D.,</b> president of the New York State Dietetic Association<br /><b>Wayne Westcott, Ph.D.,</b> author of <i>Get Stronger, Feel Younger </i>and fitness research director at the South Shore YMCA, Quincy, MA</p><p><b>Her Toughest Day - Sunday night into Monday</b><br /><b>10 p.m. </b>I pull an overnight shift once a week, so my day starts the evening before. My eating schedule is pretty ­regular except for then, but I need energy to get through the night, so I eat breakfast before I go: one Belgian waffle with butter and syrup and a latte with skim milk.<br /><b>Gans says </b>She'll burn through this high-sugar, low-protein meal in no time. Swapping it for <b>one cup of low-fat yogurt with berries and high-fiber cereal </b>would give her a lot more energy. If she can't give up the waffle, she should have it with<b> two or three scrambled egg whites or top it with natural peanut butter</b> instead of syrup. The healthy fat and protein will keep her full. </p><p><b>3 a.m.</b> Feeling sluggish at work. I should have a salad, but I'm craving comfort food. No one wants a salad when they've been up for 24 hours! A nurse has brought in a huge bowl of egg salad, and I can't ­resist--it's what I ate when I was a kid. I spread a big spoonful on wheat bread and follow it up with a Hershey's Kiss. <br /><b>KG</b> If Jenai always craves comfort food during her night shift, she needs to bring her own. Options:</p><p><b></b></p><ul><li><b>Mix up her own egg salad with two hard-boiled eggs (two whites, one yolk) and a little low-fat mayo</b></li><li><b>Snack on fruit, like a kiwi or a bowl of berries, to satisfy her sweet tooth </b></li><li><b>Make instant oatmeal with low-fat milk and add a sprinkle of cinnamon</b></li><li><b>Nuke a sweet potato and have it with low-fat yogurt</b></li></ul><p> </p><p><b>7 a.m.</b> Shift's over; I drive home in a sleep-deprived daze, kiss my husband and Josh, then collapse into bed. </p><p><b>Noon</b> Zero appetite when I wake up--it's always hard for me to get back on a normal eating schedule when I sleep until the middle of the day.<br /><b>KG </b>Understandable, but she should eat something--she needs to kick-start her metabolism if she wants to burn more calories, even if it's just <b>a bowl of high-fiber cereal with low-fat milk. </b></p><p><b>4 p.m.</b> After I feed, clean, and play with the baby, my stomach is finally growling. Grab a box of raisins and three water crackers. <br /><b>KG </b>Use snacks to your ­advantage and choose ones that are nutrient-dense. This snack has 29 grams of sugar--way too much. A fiber-protein combo that will keep her fuller much longer: a <b>high-fiber, whole-grain cracker, such as Wasa Crispbread, Kavli, or a Finn Crisp with Kraft part-skim mozzarella string cheese or Sargento sliced Jarlsberg cheese.</b></p><p><b>5 p.m.</b> Too tired to cook. On Mondays, we usually have takeout or leftovers. Tonight I order pizza and eat my slice plus the topping from my son's. I chase it with a peanut butter-chocolate chip cookie. I'm not all that hungry, but I like the three of us to sit down to dinner together. <br /><b>KG</b> Having pizza for dinner isn't going to work for her (or for her toddler). And her meals should be balanced and include a lot more greens: half a plate of veggies, one-fourth of a plate of high-fiber carbs, and one-fourth of a plate of protein. She could whip this up in very little time by ­stocking up on the following:</p><p><b></b></p><ul><li><b>a ready-to-eat roasted chicken from the supermarket</b></li><li><b>whole-grain couscous or Barilla Plus pasta</b></li><li><b>several packages of frozen vegetables to steam or boil</b></li></ul><p> </p><p><b>7 p.m.</b> I've always liked exercising and I usually work out while my son is napping. But the day after my night shift, I manage to squeeze in only 30 minutes on my recumbent bike and some ab work in the evening.<br /><b>Westcott says</b> When she's time-crunched, Jenai would be better off skipping cardio and focusing on strength training, which will increase her muscle mass and her metabolism, allowing her to burn more calories 24 hours a day. At home, she can do dumbbell squats, presses, bicep curls, and tricep extensions (eight to 12 in 60 seconds, to the point of fatigue). </p><p><b>8:30 p.m.</b> Have a glass of white wine! I deserve a treat for staying up all night, so it's either wine or ice cream. <br /><b>KG </b>Pick the wine and ditch the ice cream. The former is actually a good choice because it's fairly low in calories (around 100 per glass) and you can savor it. You have to eat ice cream fast before it melts into a mess, and then you just want more. </p><p><b>Bottom line </b>Jenai's problem isn't her schedule; it's her habit of seeking out comfort food when she's tired or stressed. Her best solution is to prepare healthier versions of her favorites. She should make a list of what she craves in comfort food (warm, squishy, heavy) and look for healthy, low-cal recipes that fit the bill (see page 44 for a cookbook that has just that). <br /><b><br />Jenai's take </b>Keeping a food diary has helped me feel more accountable to myself. Eating right takes a lot of discipline, but I feel more energized now, and I realize that it's possible to eat comfort food that's also good for me. The sacrifices are worth it: I want to be the mom running after the toddler on the beach in a bikini!</p><p><b>The habitual meal skipper</b></p><p><b>Name</b> Courtney Hanrahan<br /><b>Age</b> 31 <br /><b>Hometown</b> Abington, PA<br /><b>Occupation</b> Environmental consultant<br /><b>Height</b> 5'10""<br /><b>Starting weight</b> 205 <br /><b>Goal weight</b> 175 <br /><b>Biggest challenge</b> Frequent travel (business and pleasure) wrecks her diet and derails her fitness routine. </p><p><b>The Pros<br />Melina B.

In the hotel restaurant, while I'm waiting for my egg-white omelet, I pick at my husband's fries and end up devouring half of them. Still hungry when my breakfast arrives, I hit the buffet for a bagel with butter <i>and </i>cream cheese and chase it with a mimosa and coffee. <br /><b>Jampolis says</b> Extreme hunger will crush anyone's willpower. Courtney should take the edge off with the first high-protein and/or high-fiber food she can find--in this case, a banana or an apple from the buffet. To ensure there's always a healthy snack on hand, she should stash her own in her bag:</p><p><b></b></p><ul><li><b>turkey jerky</b></li><li><b>Zone Fruitified bars</b></li><li><b>Luna bars</b></li></ul><p> </p><p><b>Noon</b> Still stuffed, I run errands without stopping to eat. <br /><b>MJ </b>When you break the bank at one meal, it's natural to want to skip the next, but that only perpetuates a cycle of blood-sugar highs and lows. The second Courtney feels peckish, she should nosh on one of her healthy snacks to steady her energy levels. <br /><b><br />2:30 p.m.</b> I'd normally work out now, but it takes too long to get to the gym. Plus, I do that drill all week long, so I deserve a break on weekends.<br /><b>Jolly says</b> She needs to get away from an all-or-nothing attitude toward exercise. When she can't get to the gym, she should do a quick home workout: jumping rope for two minutes, deep-lunging back and forth across the living room floor 10 times, then doing as many pushups as she can. She might want to buy a watch that monitors heart rate and calories burned (such as the Mio Motiva, $100, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.miowatch.com"">miowatch.com</a>) to help motivate herself.</p><p><b>4 p.m.</b> More er
ands. I'm tired, so I have a Diet Coke.<br /><b>MJ</b> A protein-packed snack like the jerky or one of the energy bars listed above would give her an infinitely healthier, longer-lasting boost than a nutritionally empty diet soda. She could also try<b> my own snackbar </b>(available at <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.amazon.com"">amazon.com</a>), which also puts an optimal mix of protein, carbohydrates, and fiber into less than 200 calories. </p><p><b>6:30 p.m.</b> At an Italian restaurant with my husband, I scarf down two pieces of bread with butter before my Caesar salad arrives. I feel guilty, but I dive into chicken marsala and have two glasses of wine anyway. I'm showing zero restraint, but I've resisted tempting foods all week and want to treat myself. <br /><b>MJ </b>When she's dining out, Courtney should start every meal with either of these:</p><p><b></b></p><ul><li><b>a salad dressed only in olive oil and vinegar</b></li><li><b>a bowl of broth-based soup</b></li></ul><p> </p><p>If she's too hungry to wait for a first course, she should eat one of her standby snacks.</p><p><b>Bottom line </b>Imbalanced meals cause Courtney to overeat. Without a healthy mix of high-fiber carbs, protein, and fruits and veggies, she doesn't stay full for very long and winds up overeating. Having high-protein, low-calorie snacks between healthy meals will speed up her metabolism and help her avoid food gluts. <br /><b><br />Courtney's take</b> Weekends were tough because I lacked a routine, but after almost eight weeks, I've found that eating several times a day instead of ganging up my calories gives me more energy, and I'm not hungry in between meals.

It's the heart-pounding, <a href=""/nutrition/stress-busting-foods"">anxious feeling</a> produced by the impending dread of leaving the weekend behind and returning to work on Monday. </p><p>It's normal to feel some letdown as the weekend winds to a close and you begin to think about another frantic workweek. But all-out panic may be a sign that you need to change how your weekends are run. Here, some day-by-day weekend tips to help you stave off the Sunday shudders.</p><p><b>Friday:</b> Whether your workweek was good or bad, finish up your Friday by taking stock of what you <i>did</i> accomplish. Then make a list of things to tackle right off the bat on Monday morning-voice-mails or e-mails to follow up on and details you don't want to forget. Reminding yourself of what you need to do next week before leaving the office will help you to worry less during your time off. Also, on Friday make a list of things you want to do over the weekend. This includes the big sale at your favorite boutique as well as the piles of laundry. Staying semi-organized will help keep you from waking up on Sunday morning with a headache and a massive to-do list. </p><p><b>Saturday:</b> Relax by sleeping in or hitting your favorite coffee shop for a latte. Then sit down on the couch and...pay your bills?! You don't have to mix business with pleasure all weekend, but do vow to get something organizational (bills, laundry, groceries, cleaning) done on Saturday. It's one less thing to do on Sunday, plus there are ways to make it fun: Shop for the week and pick up the ingredients to make chocolate chip cookies. Cross a couple of things off your list and then carry on with your weekend fun-which will be much more enjoyable if you've tackled at least part of your to-do list.</p><p><b>Sunday:</b> Keep your morning relaxing. Finish up those pesky chores, call Mom, take a nap. Do whatever's still left on your list in whatever order you choose. But no matter what, don't put everything off until the Weekend Witching Hours of 6 to 10 p.m. Save that time for something fun: a movie, a meal you would never have time to make for yourself during the week, or a glass of wine with friends. End the weekend on a high note. You'll sleep better and feel a tad more energized when the alarm goes off on Monday morning. </p><p></p><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/images/career-center/ask-nicole.gif"" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p></p>",Career Center

Great. Got <em>organic</em> milk? That might be even better, according to a new study published in the journal <em>PLOS ONE</em>. The study found that, when it comes to those<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/healthy-fat-without-fish""> fatty acid super-nutrients</a>, whole organic milk beats out the whole conventional variety. This is the first large-scale nationwide study to compare organic and conventional milk.

The researchers found that, when the samples were averaged over 12 months, the organic whole milk had 62 percent more omega-3 fatty acids and 25 percent less omega-6 fatty acids than the conventional stuff. That meant a much lower omega-6 to omega-3 ratio for organic milk than conventional-2.3:1 and 5.8:1, respectively. </p><p>Why those ratios are important: You need both omega-6s and omega-3s in your diet, but many Americans take in way more omega-6s (found in vegetable oils, for example) than necessary. That means their omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is much higher than it should be-<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/healthy-fat-without-fish"">which some research indicates may negate the positive health effects of omega fats</a>. A potentially ideal target ratio is 2.3:1, write the study authors. A typical ratio for a Western diet? 10:1 to 15:1.

They write that this new study confirms those previous findings.</p><p>Of course, milk is just one small part of your omega-6 to omega-3 ratio-and if you're using 2 percent or 1 percent milk, these results would likely be less relevant (particularly since they have a lower fat content).

Still, we often feel like a new <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/womens-health-perfect-body-diet"">perfect body</a> really is within reach. But while it's easy to eat right, stay strong, and <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/cravings-be-gone"">resist temptation</a> early on, it gets trickier and downright treacherous as time passes - which is probably why nearly 80 percent of diets fail.<br /><br />To join the 20 percent who reach the land of leanness, you need to know what tests you'll face along the way - and what strategies you can use to best those tests. Keep this week-by-week diet guide handy and turn your resolution into a revolution.<br /><br /><b>Week 1</b><br /><br /><b>The hard part:</b> You're starving. Really, really starving.<br /><br /><b>Get through it by...</b>not skimping on <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/healthy-breakfast-options"">breakfast.</a> If you're ravenous during the first few days of your diet, it's because eating fewer calories has your body producing extra ghrelin, a hormone responsible for making you hungry, says Robert Kraemer, Ph.D., professor of kinesiology and health studies at Southeastern Louisiana University.<br /><br />To reduce ghrelin levels while still keeping your calories under control, focus on breakfast. Researchers in the Netherlands found that those who started the day with a high-calorie meal rich in complex carbohydrates produced 33 percent less ghrelin throughout the day and were more likely to feel fuller longer. Aim for a breakfast that's 20 percent of your caloric needs for the day (about 350 calories) and full of slow-burning complex carbs. That means a bowl of raisin bran and one slice of whole-wheat toast with jam, or half a cup of multigrain oatmeal and half a sliced banana sprinkled into a small container of vanilla low-fat yogurt.<br /><br /><b>Week 2</b><br /><br /><b>The hard part:</b> Going low- cal is making you uptight and edgy.<br /><br /><b>Get through it by...</b> reaching out to your friends. It's no secret that diets are as tough on your mind as they are on your body: A recent UCLA study linked dieting to chronic stress. ""The big part of dieting is changing a behavior, which can be stressful,"" says Mollie Smith, R.D., a lecturer at California State University's Fresno campus. Unfortunately, tension is doubly dangerous for dieters. Not only can it make you revert to your old eating habits, but it can also keep you fat because cortisol, a hormone released during stress, slows down weight loss.?<br /><br />This is when you need to rely on your friends for support - or even enlist them to join you in your weight-loss crusade. Researchers from the United Kingdom found that women who dieted as part of a group had less stress than those who went it alone. ""Group support is very helpful: It allows you to share frustrations with other people and learn successful ways to deal with change from other people,"" Smith says. And have faith: If you've made it this far, you're only a few days away from having things feel easier. ""After 21 days a repeated action becomes a habit,"" says Rovenia Brock, Ph.D., a nutritionist for BET.<br /><br /><b>Week 3</b><br /><br /><b>The hard part:</b> PMS munchies have you craving ice cream and potato chips - in the same bowl.<br /><br /><b>Get through it by...</b> eating more often. During the final 14 days of your menstrual cycle, called the luteal phase, progesterone is elevated. When that happens, the feel-good hormone serotonin decreases, along with endorphins and dopamine, two chemicals responsible for helping your body fight stress.?The combination makes your mood plummet and your appetite soar. Additionally, insulin sensitivity increases during this phase of the cycle, which can increase your desire to eat.<br /><br />During this cravings-crazy time of the month, skip your normal 9 A.M., noon, and 6 P.M. feedings and switch to smaller meals spread throughout the day. ""Eating four to six small meals a day will stabilize your blood sugar, cut fatigue, and also prevent bloating and lethargic feelings that can lead to overeating,"" says Gay Riley, R.D., founder of NetNutritionist.com. (See the PMS meal plan on page 34 for more information.)<br /><br /><b>Week 6</b><br /><br /><b>The hard part:</b> The scale hasn't budged, despite your best efforts.<br /><br /><b>Get through it by...</b> trying on your skinny jeans. After about 6 weeks of steady exercise you'll notice you have more muscle and less fat. That's a good thing - even though it can temporarily stall the needle on your scale. ""Muscle tissue weighs more than fat tissue because it's 70 percent water, while fat is 20 percent water,"" Riley says. But even though your weight might not be dropping, you're still making progress because your new muscle is helping you burn even more fat. (Muscle tissue uses more calories than fat cells do just to stay alive. So the more muscle you possess, the more calories you'll burn - even when you're not working out.) To curb the frustration you feel at this point in your diet, look for other ways to measure your progress. Do your clothes feel more comfortable? Can you hold a conversation when you jog? Do you look better? All those count for as much as, if not more than, what the scale says.<br /><br /><b>Month 6</b><br /><br /><b>The hard part:</b> After steadily losing weight, you stop.<br /><br /><b>Get through it by...</b> skipping the gym for a week. Take heart in the fact that you're not alone. ""Most research shows that weight loss slows or stops at 6 months,"" says Julie Meyer, R.D., a dietician from Brooklyn. Too much time at the gym can make your body too efficient - it figures out how to do the same moves burning fewer calories. Taking time off can be just what your body needs to jolt it back into gear. Do some light jogging during your off time, and come back to a new routine, says Eddie Carrington, fitness director at Bally Total Fitness. The change should be enough to shock your body back into weight loss.<br /><br /><b>Year 1</b><br /><br /><b>The hard part:</b> You get cocky, thinking you've figured out this diet thing.<br /><br /><b>Get through it by...</b> knowing that year 2 is just as important as year 1.<br /><br />After a year you've likely assimilated healthy eating and exercise into your daily life. But you're not quite finished. The world we live in - including fast food and eating on the run - can make it easy to slide back into old dietary habits. ""Right now all these forces are coming together so that when people lose weight, it can be difficult to avoid regaining that weight,"" says David Gee, Ph.D., professor of food science and nutrition at Central Washington University.<br /><br />To keep yourself on track, reward yourself for 365 days of success with a body-based treat, such as a new winter wardrobe or a massage. Then get psyched for next year by setting new goals. ""If you ran the half marathon last year, this year vow to run the full marathon,"" says Lona Sandon, R.D., an assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. If you vowed to lose 20 pounds but only lost 15, change your goal to a number-free one: finishing a triathlon, wearing a bikini by May.<br /><br />The good news: If you can keep your healthy habits for another year, you're likely to be a long-term loser. According to a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, those who maintain a consistent diet through each week for 2 years are 50 percent less likely to regain the weight. You've made it this far; why give up now?<br />","Eating Strategies,Work It Off"

Rather than just seething in traffic fumes, try coping with gridlock by practicing <a href=""/fitness/breathing-during-exercise"">calming breathing techniques</a> as you would in a yoga class, suggests Cyndi Lee, founder of OM Yoga in New York City. </p><p><b>Here's how</b>: Focus on your breath coming in and going out. Try to make each inhale and exhale the same length. For example, as you breathe in, count silently to 5, then again take 5 seconds to exhale. Think of your inhale as energizing you and your exhale relaxing you. You can even say to yourself: energy in, <a href=""/health/tips-to-stress-less"">stress out</a>. ""Balancing those two energies-active and energizing versus tranquil and calming-will make you feel more balanced, especially when you are over-stimulated,"" Lee says. ""Plus, it gives you something to concentrate on besides the bumper in front of you. And you can do it with your eyes open!""</p><p>Okay, so once you've accepted the interminable traffic, it's time to deal with the rage you feel when that selfish creep speeds past you on the shoulder. Keep your cool by changing your breath ratio: Make your exhale twice as long as your inhale. For example, inhale for a silent count of four and exhale for eight, breathing both in and out through your nose. ""Make the exhales letting-go breaths, surrendering to what is, to tip the balance in that direction,"" Lee says. Some other scenarios in which these yogic breathing exercises can come in handy: waiting in a long line when you're short on time, riding through turbulence on a plane, or buying some reflection time to help you pick your battles with your guy.</p>","Fix It,Best Yoga For..."

Would you like me to say<br />silver? Because I can guarantee that if I say silver I'll probably end<br />up with the bronze. So gold is a good color. </p><p><b>What's a normal training day for you?</b><br />This is a really hard question for me to answer. My coach (Dennis Shaver) works in cycles so depending on what part of the year it is, it can really fluctuate.In the fall we do longer tempo stuff, where we include <a href=""/fitness/yoga-or-pilates-playlist"">Pilates exercises</a>. Then in the spring we begin to concentrate more on our sprinting so we move away from running on the grass to running on the track. We lift weights every day except Sunday and Friday. </p><p><b>Are there <a href=""/nutrition/the-ultimate-nutrition-plan"">healthy eating </a>rules that you follow?</b><br />I am training at such a high level that I actually could eat anything and get by. But as my coach always says, your body is like a car, and food is like your fuel. I am a race car so I can't just put unleaded fuel in my car. I need that good premium fuel.<br /><br /><b>Tell us the five foods that you couldn't live without.</b><br />Crawfish. Dark chocolate. Baby carrots and dip. Steak. Fruit.</p><p><b>Do you have any guilty pleasure foods?</b><br />I usually treat myself to wings once a week. In the off-season I want to go for the record of eating 70 super spicy wings. </p><p><b>What keeps you going on tough days?</b><br />I count my blessings. This job can be rough: the non-stop travel, the challenging workouts. I turn the negatives to positive.</p><p>So I live out of a bag? I turn that around by saying, I also get to see countries that people dream about. </p><p>So I have to run a long workout? I think well, I get paid to work out and keep a nice body. </p><p>I am also a big fan of this quote by Frederick Douglass, ""If there is no struggle, there is no progress.""</p><p><b>What do you do to cope with stress?</b><br />I listen to a lot of Christian music, and reading my Bible calms me down immensely. But when I'm standing in a stadium packed with 80,000 screaming fans, I can't just whip out my Bible before I run. That's when I start praying! It's so loud that I can't even hear what I'm saying, but it always helps. </p><p><b>You were a track star at LSU.What made you decide to keep going after you graduated?</b><br />I did not want to quit on my dream just yet. I didn't have a big-time contract out of college like most athletes. In fact I had no contract at all. When I didn't make my first Olympic team in 2004 I was crushed. I had my college degree and knew I could make a decent living with that, but I chose to work part-time jobs so that I could train. I didn't give up because I didn't want my dream to stay a dream. I wanted it to be reality. </p><p><b>Will you continue after the Olympics?</b><br />Yes. Most hurdlers peak from the ages of 28 to 33. I'm only 25. Even the great American hero Allen Johnson is still running strong at 35! </p><p><b>What's your favorite part of being a hurdler?</b><br />The rhythm I achieve when I am running so fast that I can no longer see the hurdles, but only feel them. </p><p><b>Your least favorite part?</b><br />When I fall. It happens to the best of us. Not only is it hard to get off the track that day, it's even harder not to have a little anxiety for your next race. </p><p><b>If you could choose an Olympic sport other than any track and field events, which would you pick?</b><br />I love gymnastics.I am too tall to be a gymnast but that won't stop me from cheering for my fellow American and Iowan Shawn Johnson.</p><p><b>Do you ever get a chance to relax?</b><b>What do you do?</b><br />It's quite embarrassing but I love a game of Dance Dance Revolution. And it's a good workout. I also enjoy rock climbing, and buying a new book at the bookstore. </p><p><b>We have an <a href=""/health/tell-us-what-is-your-favorite-body-part"">ongoing discussion</a> with readers about their favorite body part.What's your favorite part of your body?</b><br />My legs. They make all my money! They are the most valuable part and I work hard for them to look and run good.</p><p><b>What's the one piece of clothing you live in?</b><br />Tank tops. They are easy to pack. </p><p><b>If you could go on a date with any celebrity, who would it be?</b><br />Actually this question is quite hard to answer, because there are just too few. Everyone I think of is either married or has just come out of rehab. So if you guys wanna set me up on a blind date, check for those two requirements first and then make it happen!

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/money-conflicts,Life,30,12,20,1,0,0,0,0,,When You Clash Over Cash,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1009-clash-over-cash.jpg,"<p>The leading cause of disagreements in the first 10 years of legalized lovin' isn't lipstick-stained collars, lap dances, and suspicious hotel charges, according to a study by the University of Michigan's Early Years of Marriage Project.<br /><br /><br /><br />It's money, honey.<br /><br /><br /><br />In fact, statistics reveal that couples argue about finances more than anything else. In a 2006 Money magazine poll, 84 percent of respondents said money causes tension in their marriage. What's more, a study last year by the University of Virginia's National Marriage Project revealed that couples who fight about finances once a week are more than 30 percent more likely to split up than other couples. ""People think money is an objective topic and that fair means the same thing to everybody,"" says Amanda Clayman, a financial therapist in New York City who writes a blog called The Good, the Bad, and the Money. ""But money is subjective and emotional. And messy.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Gender Spenders</b><br /><br />When it comes to handling the green stuff, divergent personalities abound: There are spenders who are prone to doling out dollars like Tic Tacs, hoarders who have a hard time parting with even a small amount of their hard-earned cash, dreamers who sock away a certain amount from every paycheck in hopes of one day owning a summer home or starting their own catering business, and even spiritual types who believe that money is the root of all evil.<br /><br /><br /><br />And no matter which of these categories you're in, the guy you're living with may very well be your exact opposite. Says Clayman: ""We tend to seek out partners who handle money differently than we do."" Plus, the longer you're in the relationship, the more polarized your money habits may become. And if you and your partner aren't on the same page, it can lead to drama.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Money Talks</b><br /><br />Enter a new breed of indemand expert, born out of our inability to talk about finances and further fueled by the bum economy: the financial therapist. Offering talk-based services to couples, financial therapists dig deep, looking at the emotional roots of our relationships with money-not just what our dysfunctions are and what to do about them, but also where they originated. That's because money issues are often about more than money: They can be about love, control, independence, security, or trust. ""Whatever is going on internally with a person is always expressed in how they handle money,"" says Clayman.<br /><br /><br /><br />Little wonder then that money problems often find their way into the bedroom. ""If you're lying about purchases, distrustful of each other's spending, or not able to meet financial obligations, it can be hard to sustain the connection you need to keep your sex life healthy,"" says Reeta Wolfsohn, a financial social worker in North Carolina. But combining some funds and sharing important financial responsibilities creates intimacy that enhances other aspects of your relationship.<br /><br /><br /><br />In fact, working through money issues can create a stronger emotional bond overall. ""When we talk about compromise and cooperation, it can be abstract,"" says Clayman, ""but money gives us a quantifiable tool. Building these skills can improve the well-being of the relationship.""<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Here's how to open up and talk it through:<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Get on the same page.</b><br /><br />Know where you both stand in terms of money, and figure out longterm goals as well as your thoughts on investing. ""Don't be a silent partner,"" warns Clayman. If one person is in charge of the finances and the other opts out, this can cause a lot of ""You did <i>what</i> with our money?!"" conflict later.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Face the music. </b><br /><br />""It's crucial to examine how debt was accrued and to work together to establish a plan to wipe it out,"" says Kim Corwin, a Boston-area financial counselor. ""Most people who have a significant credit-card debt live in a money fog."" Compiling bank statements, credit-card bills, and receipts in one place will clarify the need for change.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Set up weekly check-in meetings.</b> <br /><br />Use the time to pay bills, tally up the month's spending, or clear future purchases with each other. Create a ""money space,"" a location to keep your financial records. Add plants and candles to make it a less stressful environment.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Deal in cash.</b> <br /><br />Piddly stuff-like food and toiletries-is what kills a budget. So if the two of you want to figure out where the money is going, agree to pay in cash. Make a pledge: If the money runs out, there's no going back to the bank.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Set ground rules.</b> <br /><br />If remaining financially independent is important to you, keep separate accounts and have your own retirement savings and investments. But agree to continue contributing to joint accounts and to set limits on what's an acceptable joint-account purchase. Ask, ""Is this 65-inch LCD flat-screen something we both want?""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Talk about your past.</b> <br /><br />""Money issues stem from your past experiences and can be tough to shake,"" says Clayman. Talk about how financial matters were treated in his family and in yours. Discuss the ways your parents saved, spent, and talked about money-and whether you will repeat those patterns or reject them. ""What you've each learned to accept as normal will offer insight into your values and foster a level of intimacy,"" says Clayman.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Let him have it.</b> <br /><br />Reenact a fake argument about money-with your partner pretending to be you, and you pretending to be him-to see how you both come across to each other. It's an eye-opener. ""When most couples try this, they begin to understand each other for the first time,"" says Wolfsohn.<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p>",What To Wear

Yet even though the fit 33-year-old goes to the gym five times a week and runs marathons for charity, the policy she found cost more than $800 a month. ""That's a quarter of my income,"" she says. ""And that didn't even cover my $400-a-month asthma drugs."" Unable to handle the payments, she switched to a bare-bones plan that has a $150 monthly premium but covers only catastrophic <a href=""/health/emergency-room-symptoms"">medical crises</a> (like a ruptured appendix or a car accident). ""I can't afford to get my eyes checked, or see a dentist, and I had to pay $800 out-of-pocket when I developed a stress fracture in my foot last summer,"" she says. ""I work hard and I take good care of myself, yet it's still next to impossible to get decent coverage."" </p><p>With <a href=""/life/find-a-new-job"">unemployment</a> rising (as of press time, the rate was 8.9 percent) and companies cutting back on benefits, more and more Americans are experiencing the sticker shock of buying unsubsidized health insurance for the first time. ""Even healthy people are facing payments they simply can't afford,"" says Arthur Caplan, Ph.D., director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. ""And if you have a preexisting problem, forget it. Health insurance rates are beyond the means of everyone but the most wealthy.""</p><p>But anyone who saw the Michael Moore documentary <i>Sicko</i> knows that if you can't afford to buy health insurance, its like playing Russian roulette with your financial security-all it takes is one extended illness or accident to wipe out your savings and put you deeply in debt. </p><p>Over the past decade, the average yearly contribution to even employer-sponsored plans has gone through the roof-up more than $1,800, as the table below shows. Why the upward spiral? We've outlined the top five reasons-and offer five expert-recommended ways to bring your costs back down.</p><p><b>1. Your doctor is freaked about getting sued</b> Experts call it defensive medicine. ""Doctors often order unnecessary diagnostic tests, procedures, and therapies to cover their butts in case of a legal dispute,"" Caplan says. The more stuff your insurance company has to cover, the more it will pass those costs to you. </p><p><b>2. Your insurer pushes more paper than Dunder Mifflin</b> A third of U.S. health-care expenditures goes toward administrative costs (Canada spends less than half that-about 16 percent). But that money goes to more than just reams of dead trees; it also pays the salaries of everyone from phone operators to top executives, as well as for claims processing and sales. </p><p><b>3. You're female</b> Research from the National Women's Law Center has found that when buying private health insurance, women have to cough up significantly more than men for identical policies. A 25-year-old woman, for instance, pays anywhere from 6 percent to 45 percent more. Insurance companies base the discrepancy on the fact that women are more likely to see their doctors. While that is true of women in their reproductive years, men catch up after age 50-when they're the ones who become more likely to be hit with chronic problems such as heart disease. </p><p>But, as the government looks to overhaul the health-care industry, we may see some positive change: In May, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts introduced a congressional bill that would prohibit insurers from charging women more just because they happen to be female. </p><p><b>4. Your insurer would rather pay to treat a disease than prevent one</b> Covering preventive care is low on most insurance companies' priority lists, even though doing so could help patients avoid serious illnesses and their complications-as well as their pricey treatments. ""We pay for costly interventions like bypass surgery or chemotherapy to treat diseases at the back end instead of focusing on lifestyle changes to keep patients healthy on the front end,"" says Aaron Carroll, M.D., director of the Indiana University Center for Health Policy and Professionalism Research. Placing a priority on preventive care would also save billions: One recent report showed that investing just $10 per person per year in programs on exercise, nutrition, and smoking cessation could save $16 billion per year in another five years.</p><p><b>5. Your doctor is paid for how much he does for you-not for how well he cares for you</b> Under the fee-for-service model that most health-insurance plans use, physicians make more money with every office visit and procedure they do. That gives them a built-in financial incentive to push for more, though not necessarily better, health care, says award-winning journalist Shannon Brownlee, author of <i>Overtreated: Why Too Much Medicine Is Making Us Sicker and Poorer</i>. </p><p><b>The Best Ways To Lower Costs </b><br />Negotiate with your provider ""If you don't have insurance or if you have a high-deductible plan [that's where you exchange a lower monthly premium for higher out-of-pocket fees], tell your doctor,"" says Ethan Ewing, president of bills.com, a website that offers personal-finance services. ""Explain that you'll be paying for this care yourself, and ask if you can get a better rate if they bill you directly."" Some providers will also offer reduced fees if you pay cash on the spot. ""Speak up as early in the process as possible,"" Ewing advises. ""Medical providers will be much more willing to negotiate payment terms and try to work with you."" </p><p>Consider COBRA carefully If you're laid off by a company with more than 20 employees, you're entitled to stay on your employer's group health plan for up to 18 months. The catch: You're on the hook for the entire premium, which may be more than you can afford. If you're free of chronic conditions and don't have kids, you might be better off with a high-deductible individual plan. You'll have to pay more out-of-pocket if you do get sick, but some programs cover 100 percent of preventive care, so at least you won't have to come up with the cash for your yearly Pap. </p><p>Keep records of your health-care expenses You may qualify for a tax deduction if your total medical expenses exceed 7.5 percent of your Adjusted Gross Income. In addition, if you're self-employed and pay your own premiums, your insurance costs are fully deductible. </p><p>Get your insurer to pay for more coverage Your doc says your treatment is necessary, but your insurer disagrees. Instead of just sighing and forking over the money, file an appeal-about half the time you can get a better deal, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study. You'll improve your odds of success if you get your doctor on board and provide supporting evidence from medical studies to help bolster your case. (One good source: <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.pubmed.gov"">pubmed.gov</a>.) Even if your request is rejected, you might be able to submit a second appeal to your state health board; contact the department of insurance in your state to determine what rules and regulations apply. </p><p>Find an advocate A patient advocate negotiates with insurers on your behalf, scours your medical bills for errors and overcharges, and helps you file appeals. In one instance, the Medical Billing Advocates of America (MBAA) uncovered a $57 charge for a small piece of gauze to wipe down surgical equipment (the cloth was itemized on an invoice as a ""fog elimination device"").

After all, new research from the Center for Sexual Health Promotion at Indiana University suggests that she hasn't checked herself out much-only 26 percent of women look closely at their lady bits. Hey, we get it. Guys have it so much easier. Their junk is hanging out there, just waiting to be experienced. Most of our parts are internal, so we can't exactly see what we're working with.<br /><br />Well, here's some incentive to change all that: The more you make your vagina your business, the more pleasure you'll experience. In a separate study published in the International Journal of Sexual Health, scientists found that women who had a positive view of their genitals were more comfortable in their skin, more apt to orgasm, and more likely to experiment in bed. Ding-ding-ding rings the pleasure bell! In fact, just looking at your goodies can be a turn-on. ""Research shows that seeing signs of sex helps inspire arousal and lubrication,"" says Debby Herbenick, Ph.D., a research scientist at Indiana University and the author of <em>Because It Feels Good</em>. So allow us to scroll down there, if you will, for a better view. Oh, and when we're done, you might want to update your status.<p></p><p><b>PRIVATE INVESTIGATION</b><br />To start, let's clear up one of the biggest misconceptions about the vagina. It's not the entire genital area. If you're standing <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/set/?keycode=142686"">naked</a> in front of a full-length mirror, you're actually seeing your vulva, the exterior portion of your privates, which was covered in hair before your aesthetician went hog wild with the wax and muslin.<br /><br />Think of your privates as an award-winning cast: You have your supporting actors (the vulva) and your marquee stars (the clitoris and G-spot). Every part is there to entertain your sexual needs, but to milk the best performance out of each one, you have to show them all a little love and attention. So lock the bedroom door, kick off your shoes, and grab a hand mirror.</p><p>Without even spreading your legs, you'll see your pubic mound and two folds of skin called the labia majora (the outer lips). Both contain layers of fatty tissue that protect your clitoris and vagina. While pleasure reception is typically weak in this area, manual play can help increase the signal. ""Rubbing the pubic mound and outer lips readies the clitoris for stimulation,"" says Herbenick.</p><p>Now, if you gently push apart the outer lips, you'll reveal a thinner set of lips called the labia minora. These hairless babies are loaded with blood vessels, nerve endings, and secreting glands. ""To the naked eye, the glands may look like tiny bumps,"" says Diana Hoppe, M.D., author of Healthy Sex Drive, Healthy You. ""They release secretions that actually help to separate your lips for easier penetration.""</p><p>But they're not the only things lubing up your nether regions. When you spread the labia minora apart, you'll encounter Bartholin's glands (which are microscopic, so you can't actually see them with the naked eye) on each side of your vaginal opening. As you become aroused, these glands lubricate the outer portion of the vaginal canal. They typically release only a small amount of moisture, which is why so many women need plenty of foreplay to stay wet.<br /><br /><b>WELCOME TO THE PLEASURE CENTER</b><br />Here's where the clitoris comes in. She's that proud little pink nub, roughly the size of a pencil eraser, and she's there only for sexual pleasure. The girl's got some nerve-approximately 8,000 nerve endings, to be exact, the largest number found in the entire body and double the amount found in the glans of a man's penis, says Hoppe. Of course, that number makes her crazy sensitive, but you already knew that. What you probably didn't know is that she's got legs. Literally. ""We see only the head of the clitoris,"" says Herbenick. But it has a body that's shaped like a wishbone, with two legs (called crura) that reach three inches into the vagina, just under the pubic mound and straight into G-spot territory (but more on that later). This gives the clitoris incredible sexual reach and depth. ""It's the powerhouse of the orgasm,"" says Ian Kerner, Ph.D., author of She Comes First. ""It connects with every single structure in the genitals.""<br /><br />The best way to make the clitoris happy is through direct, consistent, yet gentle oral or manual stimulation. But it's also quite responsive to woman-on-top and during a twist on missionary called the coital alignment technique, says Herbenick. In this position, your guy enters you as he normally would during missionary, with two simple tweaks: He inches his body up until his shoulders rest above yours and the base of his penis directly hits your clitoris. Then he grinds in a circular motion instead of thrusting, which ""creates more friction against the clitoris,"" explains Herbenick.</p><p>Friction can feel fabulous, but sometimes the little starlet can be a touch overexposed. As you head toward climax, ""the clitoris swells in size, which can make friction painful,"" says Hoppe. Some women report that clitoral stimulation at this point can feel like an irritating tickle, and in some cases, like a really sharp shock. To protect itself, the clitoris retreats back under the protective awning of the clitoral hood. Often, simply lightening up the stimulation a bit will make it feel good again.</p><p>An overly sensitive clitoris is your body's way of saying, ""Let the vagina soak up some of the sexual spotlight, please!"" The four- to seven-inch canal (it varies depending on the woman) can't hold a candle to the clitoris in the nerve-ending department. But it does boast a bunch, says Hoppe. The first two to three inches of the vagina ""have hundreds of nerve endings and are majorly sensitive,"" she says. ""That's why when a woman is giving birth and the baby is crowning, they call it the 'ring of fire.'"" To stimulate these first few inches of your vaginal canal, try shorter, shallower thrusting during sex.</p><p><b>WHAT LIES BENEATH</b><br />Deeper into the vaginal walls, you'll find one of the vagina's trickiest trump cards: the G-spot. If the clitoris is famous, the G-spot is infamous. Not every woman can tap into its potential, but if you do, the rewards are phenomenal.<br /><br />The G-spot is a spongy area about the size of a nickel, and it's located an inch or two into the anterior wall of the vagina, just under the pubic mound--and you've got to feel it to believe it. It has bumpy, knotty striations similar to a walnut, and it demands a hands-on, tough-love approach. ""The G-spot's nerves are contained in fattier tissue, so you have to provide deeper, firmer pressure to stimulate it,"" says Kerner. For starters, you should already be really turned on before it's accessed. That's because the tissue doesn't swell and make itself known until you've enjoyed proper foreplay.</p><p>G-spot stimulation also calls for a tag-team approach. You can hit it by having your guy enter you from behind, but the best bet is to have him go down on you with his tongue and fingers. ""With his mouth on your clitoris, have him use his fingers in a come-hither motion to apply firm, rhythmic pressure to the G-spot,"" says Kerner. Put those two together and it's like they're high-fiving each other for a job well done.</p><p>If you haven't had what you think is a G-spot orgasm, don't stress over it. (For the record, orgasms that originate in this zone generally feel expansive and deep, while orgasms that start in the clitoris often feel more acute and intense.) ""Many women say the G-spot enhances their orgasm,"" says Kerner. ""They wouldn't isolate it and say, 'Wow, I just had a G-spot orgasm.' It's more like, 'I just had an orgasm, and what he was doing felt really good.' That's why most vibrators come with a clitoral stimulator and a G-spot stimulator. They work in tandem to create what's commonly referred to as a blended orgasm."" While you can have a clitoral orgasm without G-spot stimulation, it's a little trickier to achieve the reverse. But ultimately, it doesn't matter where it's coming from-at the end of the day, an orgasm is an orgasm. And they all feel amazing.</p><p>How well do you know your vagina? <br />Take our quiz at WomensHealthMag.com/Vagina.<br /><br /><b>Down-There Myths</b><br />It's time for these tall tales to bounce.<br /><br /><b>""It smells bad down there.""</b><br />Of all the myths, this is the one that really pisses off the experts-especially because it keeps women from accepting and enjoying oral sex, the prime gateway to orgasm. ""We are overly sensitive and insecure about the smell of our vaginas,"" says sex educator Logan Levkoff, Ph.D., author of <i>Third Base Ain't What It Used to Be</i>. ""And we are far harder on it than any partner would be."" Experts chalk it up to years of douche advertisements and the perception that vaginas should smell like rosewater. Um, they don't. Every woman has her own unique scent, but most of us have a musky smell that men are biologically wired to be attracted to, says Lissa Rankin, M.D. ""Your scent may change from day to day, depending on how hot the weather is, what you ate, and when you last showered."" That said, it's good to know what you smell like on an average day so that you can pinpoint any changes. A fishy smell, for instance, could be a sign of an infection called bacterial vaginosis.<br /><br /><b>""They all look the same.""</b><br />Like any other body part, the vagina and vulva have basic shapes, but there is quite a bit of variation in coloration, symmetry, and pubic hair patterns. The biggest variation is in the labia minora, says Debby Herbenick, Ph.D. ""Studies in which the lips have been measured have found up to 150 percent difference from one woman to another."" Translation: Labial size can vary by up to an inch and a half.<br /><br /><b>""It can be too tight or too loose.""</b><br />Unless a woman is a virgin or she's had a traumatic birthing experience with multiple children, there aren't big anatomical differences in vaginal canals, says Herbenick. Usually, feeling too tight or loose is a matter of lubrication. If you're too wet, there's not enough friction. If you're too dry, almost any penis will feel huge. Always have a tube of lube within reach if you tend to be dry, or a hand towel nearby if you get sopping wet. Granted, women who've had several vaginal deliveries might feel slightly looser, because some nerve endings have been destroyed, says Diana Hoppe, M.D. But Kegels can help strengthen the pelvic floor and muscles surrounding the vagina. ""To do them, squeeze to contract the vaginal muscles for two seconds, then relax. Repeat for 10 minutes whenever you're waiting somewhere,"" she says.<br /><br /><b>""You can lose stuff in it.""</b><br />Think your tampon went AWOL? No need to call the search-and-rescue squad. ""Women seem to have this concept that the vagina is some never-ending tube that goes into the lungs,"" says Rankin. ""But the vagina is like a sock. It goes only so far in length, so you can pull out anything that gets stuck."" The cervix is a microscopic hole, and only a sperm can slip through there and make itself at home in the uterus. Anything else will hit a roadblock. Thank God.<br /><br /></p>",
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/women-sweat,Health,51,11,11,20,0,0,7,0,,Don’t Sweat It!,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1009-dont-sweat-it.jpg,"<p>Any woman who's ever reached for a glass of wine on a date only to reveal the soaked underarms of her outfit has probably wished she could remove her sweat glands. But long before pit stains became a social obstacle, perspiring was crucial to survival. ""Sweat cooled off our ancestors in the grasslands of Africa,"" says anthropologist Helen Fisher, Ph.D. ""It allowed them to hunt and forage without sweltering."" But a hot climate isn't the only thing that makes us sweat. Nerve-racking situations (e.g., a big job interview) can prompt the brain to trigger the release of stress hormones that raise your body's temperature enough to warrant a cooldown.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Basic Biology</b><br /><br />Bodily functions such as digestion and muscle movements generate heat, and we perspire constantly to keep things chilled. So while you're busy patting down your sweat 'stache, your system is on AC overdrive, sending and fielding a complex network of cooldown codes. Here's what's happening in your body:</p><p><br /><b>1.</b> In response to scorching temps or frazzled nerves, your brain fires a sweat signal down your spinal cord, triggering the release of a chemical called acetylcholine.<br /><br /><br /><b>2.</b> The acetylcholine shoots from your spinal cord into thousands of nerves that travel to your legs, arms, chest, face, and back.<br /><br /><br /><b>3.</b> The acetylcholine arrives at your 4 million eccrine glands (wedged between your fat and skin layers) and prompts them to start filtering fluid from your bloodstream to produce sweat. <br /><br /><br /><b>4.</b> Your eccrine glands then pump out the stuff-99 percent water, 1 percent salt-through your skin's millions of pores. <br /><br /><br /><b>5.</b> The released sweat helps regulate your core temperature, much like splashing yourself with cold water helps you cool off. Most sweat starts to evaporate immediately, but if your glands are working overtime, it'll pool up on your skin. Or, if you're dressed, it'll seep into your clothes.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Ways to Stay Dry</b><br /><br />Even people who think they're as dry as a desert are constantly losing water, says Dee Anna Glaser, M.D., a professor of dermatology at Saint Louis University School of Medicine. ""Just the act of breathing makes us sweat."" On average, we perspire enough each day to fill a shot glass (1.5 ounces), and that's before working out or otherwise exerting ourselves. Because the highest concentrations of sweat glands are in our armpits, forehead, soles, palms, and scalp, those tend to be our dampest parts. If you're a real drippy mess, you can thank Mom and Dad; DNA regulates the actual amount we sweat, says Glaser.<br /><br /> </p><p>Swiping on antiperspirant is the easiest way to stay dry. Most formulas contain aluminum, which soaks into your skin and corks your eccrine glands. (Plain odor-masking traditional or natural deodorants, on the other hand, contain no aluminum and therefore no sweat blockers.) Technically, you can use antiperspirant anywhere, but because many are oil based, they're hard to apply to, say, your hands or feet. Hint: Applying antiperspirant to your sweat-free pits in the p.m. can make it more effective, says Kelley Redbord, M.D., a dermatologist in Vienna, Virginia. ""Because your skin is dry and you're not as physically active at night, it's easier for antiperspirant to plug your glands for up to three days,"" she says. Just be wary of using it morning and night; too many swipes may cause skin irritation.<br /><br /><br /><br />Still sweating? Try a clinical-strength over-the-counter antiperspirant; these are packed with up to 20 percent aluminum zirconium, the maximum amount allowed by the FDA. (While some scientists point to a potential link between aluminum and breast cancer, the American Cancer Society maintains that there's no solid evidence to support this claim.) Or order a box of MedeTate wipes ($48 for a pack of 30, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.dermadoctor.com"">dermadoctor.com</a>). The mix of a type of aluminum zirconium and acetylcholine-hindering botanicals on these towelettes isn't long lasting, but it does work well in a pinch.<br /><br /><br /><br />If no other solution is effective enough, you can safely turn to-wait for it-Botox. The much-hyped wrinkle reducer has been approved by the FDA to combat underarm sweat (it works by binding to and blocking acetylcholine). When Botox is injected into the forehead, palms, armpits, or feet, it stops seepage for as long as eight months. At around $800 a vial (and that's just enough for both armpits), the treatment doesn't come cheap, but it also won't divert your sweat anywhere else.<br /><br /><br /></p><p></p><p></p>",

In 2004, a study published in the International Journal of Obesity found that rats ate more after consuming an artificially sweetened drink than they did after sipping sugar water. Researchers say that might be because calorie-free artificial sweeteners act like stomach teasers: As you down your diet soda, your body anticipates the calories. When they don't arrive, your body sends you looking elsewhere for them, often in a snack bowl.</p><p>And get this: A 2005 study by researchers from the University of Texas found that people who drank a can of diet soda per day had a 37 percent greater incidence of obesity.</p><p><b><a href=""/weight-loss/snacks-and-weight-loss-0"">Healthy replacement treats:</a></b></p><p><b>Apples:</b><br /><br />A 2003 Brazilian study found that three apples a day can keep weight gain at bay--and can even help you lose.

The first is complicated and involves blocking an enzyme that plays a role in fat accumulation. The second is simpler. ""Licorice can reduce appetite,"" he says. ""The effect is probably related to the agreeable taste of licorice, and for that reason people do not need to eat more.""</p><p>We're not talking Twizzlers here; go for the real thing, preferably with licorice extract high on its ingredient list. (Look for it in grocery stores, not convenience stores.) A handful is about 150 calories and will keep you busy chewing something sweet, flavorful, and satisfying for twice the time it takes to down a bag of M&Ms.</p><p><b>And if you must have chocolate:<br /></b><br />Try Hershey's All Natural Extra Dark <a href=""/nutrition/premium-packaged-foods?cat=9780&tip=10033"">Pure Dark Chocolate</a> with 60% Cacao. They're individually wrapped 45-calorie squares so you won't go off the chocolaty deep end.

Are Southern guys really chivalrous?</b><br />Yes. We're brought up that way. You can find all types of men anywhere, but a smart man will always make you feel important and understood. And a woman can always tell when a man does it genuinely and effortlessly. </p><p><b>What's something women would be surprised to learn that <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/love"">guys find sexy</a>?</b><br />Two things. First are body parts women are usually not happy with, such as a soft waistline and hips. I like both very much. Women hate when guys touch and pinch them there, but men don't have curves, and the more women embrace them, the sexier it is! Second: when a <a href=""/fitness/best-workouts-for-women"">sweaty woman</a> is leaving the gym, because it's similar to the way she might look right after sex. Anything that suggests you in that act [is hot]. </p><p><b>What was your biggest misconception about marriage before you got hitched?</b><br />That nothing would change. I was with my wife for five years before we got married. At some point, she was ready to take the next step, and I would say, ""I'm committed to you now; nothing's going to change."" But [once you marry] there is a huge difference. It's a different mindset. If you already have a great relationship, it'll only sweeten the deal. </p><p><b>What have you learned about love?</b><br />Don't try to intellectualize it or understand it, and don't overanalyze it. That's the beauty of love. All those things like smells and chemistry come in when you're face to face. </p><p><b>Off-topic question: You've starred in several superhero movies. What secret power do you wish you possessed?</b><br />It would be cool to be invisible, but I'm afraid of what people would say about me if they didn't know I was there.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty-and-style/shaving-and-waxing-tips,Beauty And Style,2,11,0,4,0,0,1,0,,Waxing and Shaving Tips,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0608-fuzz-busterse-0973.jpg,"Bridget Jones said that women are like farmers - constantly scraping, trimming, weeding, and plucking. And it can feel like we're forever fighting unwanted strands. (In warm months, 73 percent of women remove leg hair at least three times a week, and 61 percent tame the bikini line at least once a week.) But once you understand the science of hair growth, you'll be able to select the best tools and <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty-and-style/wh-beauty-awards"">beauty products</a> to get an amazingly close shave and win this (woolly) mammoth battle. <br /><br />Like an iceberg, a hair shows only its tip; your true adversary, the root or follicle, lurks below the surface. Follicles follow a repeating three-phase life cycle - hair growth, hair death, rest. The growth phase lasts about 6 weeks; the resting phase, up to 6 months. Only about 30 percent of your follicles are sprouting hair at a time. The rest are hibernating until a new growth cycle begins. And why does all this matter? <br /><br />Well, if you're using a shaving cream or using a depilatory, it doesn't. Both methods lop off only visible hair - they don't mess with the follicle, which is their biggest shortcoming: To stay smooth, you've got to do maintenance every few days or resign yourself to wearing those <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty-and-style/style-tips-tights"">patterned tights</a> the rest of the year. For more <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty-and-style/best-razors"">shaving tips</a>, see the tools you'll need to battle the fuzz.<br /><br />But if you're bringing out the big guns - lasers and electrolysis - to target that dastardly follicle, hair growth cycles are key. Both procedures work best when your strands are growing; the hair conducts the destructive heat or electric current down to the follicle. <br /><br />The light energy in lasers is drawn to dark pigment, so they're most effective if you have fair skin and dark hair. But the laser can be adjusted to handle almost every variation of skin and hair types, which is why selecting an experienced laser technician is essential. (Ask your dermatologist for a recommendation.)<br /><br />The operator shines the beam over the furry area 2 centimeters at a time. The hair absorbs the laser's heat, disabling the follicle. It hurts, but it's not unbearable - like a rubber band snap. And while the procedure has been around for about a decade, new lasers are making it more popular. The latest devices operate at longer wavelengths, to treat dark complexions or very light hair safely. But it'll cost you: from $100 for the lip to $1,000 for the leg, per session.<br /><br />Alas, one laser session isn't enough, because most of your hairs will be ""resting"" and immune to the rays. You'll need to schedule three to seven appointments at 6-week intervals to see significant results. And then the hair will be gone forever, right? Not exactly. Some follicles have an irritating habit of recovering from laser damage, and inevitably some hair sprouts due to changes in hormone levels. That's why the service can only be called permanent hair reduction (not removal). And you'll likelyneed yearly touch-ups.<br /><br />Electrolysis involves inserting a small needle into each follicle, then applying an electric current to destroy it. It's often best for treating your face, because hair there tends to be blonder and finer than elsewhere on your body, making lasers less effective, says Eric Bernstein, M.D., a dermatologic laser surgeon in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Sessions start around $200, and you'll need to schedule three to five sessions 6 weeks apart to zap every single hair. The good news is the fried hairs generally stay gone. But here's the big downside: Shooting electricity into your follicles hurts like hell.<br /><br />If going Star Wars on your Chewbacca areas is a bit intimidating, waxing offers the next best results. Like tweezing, it rips hair out at the root. And here's the best part: Repeated waxing thins growth. ""With every waxing, the follicle weakens, so the hair grows in sparser and finer,"" says Mary Lupo, M.D., clinical professor of dermatology at Tulane University Medical School. (Tweezing does the same - which is why so many overzealous pluckers wind up penciling in their brows as they get older.)<br /><br />There are two types of wax. Hard wax doesn't stick to skin, so it hurts less - a big plus - but its consistency limits its use to small areas. Soft wax, which is ripped off with large fabric strips, is better for the legs and bikini line. While you can do it yourself, you should see a professional for a bikini wax (you'll never get a good enough view) and for your face. ""Wax can be dangerous in unskilled hands,"" warns Doris J. Day, M.D., a dermatologist in New York City. ""The skin around the eye area is fragile, so wax that is too hot or removed improperly can burn and scar."" And forget about waxing if you take prescription acne medication or use Retin-A - they make your skin more susceptible to bruising and burning. You'll need to stop taking them for 3 weeks if you want to wax.<br /><br />A follicle won't go down without a struggle. But you can minimize the suffering. Schedule appointments for the 2 weeks after your period. A new study found you're less susceptible to pain then. (You're most sensitive the week before your period.) Take an anti-inflammatory, like ibuprofen, 30 minutes before. A topical numbing agent like LMX 4, containing lidocaine, is available over the counter. Always consult your doctor on how to use a numbing cream to avoid a potentially dangerous allergic reaction.<br /><br />Once you've won your battle with body hair, you can focus your attention on more worthwhile pursuits - preferably ones that will allow you to show off your smooth skin. <br />",Easy Hair

Those tiny keystroke movements don't seem like much, but all the repetition can bring the pain to your fingers and wrists. And once you do the damage, <a href=""/yoga/fix-it-with-yoga"">carpal tunnel syndrome</a>-chronic wrist, hand, and forearm pain-can be a bear to get rid of. To ward off and relieve these symptoms, carve out two or three mini-breaks in your type-intensive day for these exercises from Karin Wiedemann of Urban Yoga in Washington, D.C.</p><p><b>Figure eights</b><br />Sit up tall in a chair and bring your hands together in front of you, fingers interlaced. Keeping your elbows bent, alternately push your hands to the side so that your right wrist bends back, and then the left one. Using this back-and-forth as a base, start moving your hands in an imaginary figure eight, rotating the wrists more fully. Do this until you feel relief.</p><p><b>Overhead reach<br /></b><br />Still sitting upright, relax your arms at your sides so your palms face out comfortably. Take an inhale and lift your arms up overhead. Interlace your fingers. Turn your palms up to the ceiling, either keeping your arms slightly bent or straightening them. Hold for 10 slow, <a href=""/fitness/breathing-during-exercise"">deep breaths</a> (counting an inhale and an exhale as one breath). On your last exhalation, lower your arms to your sides. Then inhale, interlacing your fingers overhead again, but this time with the opposite hand on top. Be sure to lift the thumb side of your hands as much as the pinky side. Hold for 10 slow, deep breaths. This overhead reach stretches out the muscles and connective tissue in the forearms and hands while bringing flexibility to the hands and fingers. Plus, it boosts circulation.</p><p><b>Finger-bender</b><br />Sitting up, bring your right forearm in toward your chest. With your left hand, bend back your right fingers (minus thumb) to your right. Hold for 10 slow, deep breaths. Then bend those same four fingers the opposite way, with your palm pushing them toward the floor. Hold for 10 slow breaths before repeating with the left hand.</p>","Fix It,Best Yoga For..."

Some endeavors, however, are worth a team approach. Consider this: A University of Pittsburgh study showed that women who work out with a partner lose a third more weight than those who go it alone. And then there's this: Exercise increases blood flow throughout your body - including <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/files/vagina-guide/index.html"">down there</a>. So yeah, working out with him is a pound-shedding, sex drive-revving option you should take advantage of - pronto. <br /><br />Which is great advice if you can use it, but few couples are matches made in fitness heaven. (Him in your Cardio Capoeira class? Um, no.) Don't despair, though: Even if the only ""gym"" in his life is a stick of mystery meat called Slim, you can still benefit from working out together, no matter what your fitness goals or personalities. Try these tricks from leading trainers, physiologists, and fitness pros to get your butts moving together in no time. Just think of it as <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/sex-tips"">foreplay</a>!<br /><br /><b>You...Love to Work Out<br />He...Hasn't Broken a Sweat Since High School</b><br /><br /><b>Do-It-Together Strategy</b> <br />Your best plan of attack: motivation. ""Men are goal-oriented,"" says Eleanor Cole, Ph.D., a psychologist in New York City, ""so set up rewards for meeting small goals."" (Kinda like when you bought yourself that new Stella gym bag.) It takes about 4 weeks - or, say, 12 trips to the gym - for exercise to become a habit. Get him addicted by offering a small incentive after every four workouts, like an Amazon.com gift card for a pair of <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/weight-training-tips"">weight-lifting </a>gloves or movie tickets for <i>Blades of Glory</i>, the Will Ferrell figure-skating flick. (Warning: Be prepared for 2-plus hours of Ferrell in spandex. On ice.) After he makes it to week 4, cement his new habit with the 0.55-ounce, 1-gig iPod Shuffle, the world's smallest MP3 player ($79, apple.com). <br /><br />If the gym isn't his thing, look for a coed sports team, says Kate Hays, Ph.D., a Toronto-based sports psychologist, to provide a steady play date on the field or court. Check active.com to find athletic leagues in your area. ""Ideally, pick something different than what you're already good at,"" Hays says. If you play tennis Sharapova-style, he may start to lose motivation when he can't even return your serves. <br /><br /><b>You...Want to Tone Up<br />He... Wants to Bulk Up</b><br /><br /><b>Do-It-Together Strategy</b> <br />Lifting weights isn't going to turn either of you into a bulging muscle freak - unless you want it to. It's all in the approach. To get lean and strong with weights, work large muscle groups, such as the back, chest, and legs. ""They burn the most calories,"" says Sheila Kalas, an exercise physiologist at the University of Kentucky and owner of Fitness Plus in Lexington. <br /><br />So join your man on days when he's doing the following fat-obliterating exercises: squats, leg extensions, and leg curls for the lower body; chest presses, flies, lat pulldowns, and rows for the chest and back. To tone up and kill calories, do one to three sets of 12 to 15 reps, using enough weight that your muscles are fatigued (but not completely spent) when you get to the last rep. To build mass, he should do three to five sets of 8 to 10 reps, using enough weight that by the end of the last set, he can't do one more rep. Sick of waiting around for your turn on the machine? Finish your session with a few time-saving, calorie-busting tandem moves like the three on these pages from Michael Curry, owner of Stronghold Fitness in West Los Angeles.<br /><br /><b>You...Play to Win<br />He...Plays to Annihilate</b><br /><br /><b>Do-It-Together Strategy</b> <br />Okay, so you're both cutthroat maniacs. No worries. In a 2002 study, researchers at Penn State University found that when women anticipate competition they get a surge of testosterone, which boosts the libido - you do the math. Use this to your advantage by choosing a workout strategy that plays off your it-doesn't-matter-how-much-I-love-you-I'm-going-to-whoop-your-sweet-ass nature - without killing each other in the process.<br /><br />If you're all about the weight room, you can keep his Schwarzenegger-size ego in check with this trick: Figure out what percentage of your respective body weight each of you is hoisting, suggests Rachel Cosgrove, C.S.C.S., who owns a gym in Santa Clarita, California, with her husband and workout partner, Alwyn. Simply divide the number of pounds you're lifting by your body weight and, voil, suddenly the playing field is level.<br /><br />If you're more about cardio, run or bike together three times a week. On day 1, he chooses the route. On day 2, you devise the workout plan. And on day 3, play Simon Says: Do intervals, alternating who gets to set the time, distance, and style (here's your chance to see him make a fool out of himself skipping or high-kneeing to the next streetlight). ""Our bodies love routine, but that gets us into a rut,"" Curry says. Mixing it up this way ""shocks the muscles, and you start burning major calories again."" <br />","Getting Started,relationships"

But while Tim worked odd hours at his new job, Mary filled her lonely days with food. ""I ate for comfort and indulged in the local cuisine-oily pasta, buttered bread, lots of cannoli,"" she says. By the time Tim was discharged and they returned to Monroe in 2002, she was 90 pounds heavier and depressed. In the next seven years, Mary gave birth to two boys, which improved her spirits but not her weight.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Change</b><br /><br />In December 2009, Mary reached down to pick up her youngest son, Parker, then 5 months old, and felt a stab in her back. A visit to the doctor revealed two bulging disks and a pinched nerve. ""When I learned my weight was the main factor in my injury, I decided I could not, would not, live like that anymore,"" she says.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Lifestyle</b><br /><br />When the pain subsided in January 2010, Mary joined a gym.

""Who needs therapy when there's a treadmill and weights?"" It was uplifting to see 25 pounds melt off, but she hit a wall in March.<br /><br /><br /><br />To push the scale below 220, she signed up for two back-to-back monthlong boot-camp classes. When they ended, she did intervals and lifted weights five days a week, using <a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/iPhone""><i>Women's Health</i> iPhone apps</a>. Mary also streamlined her diet. ""I replaced processed foods and bad carbs with high-fiber options and healthy fats,"" she says.

But I'm not your average bum, either. When it comes to my basic grooming philosophy, I fall somewhere between a GQ model and Jack Black. I think I speak for most guys when I say that anything more complicated and high-tech than shaving and shampooing is time better spent finding the right shortstop for our fantasy baseball teams. And wandering the drugstore or department store aisles trying to sort out the difference between ""triton"" and ""phoenix"" or ""woodsy"" and ""earthy"" scents is my idea of hell on earth. Let alone trying to analyze whether I need both the cologne and the aftershave.</p><p>Obviously, it's different for women. When my girlfriend, Trish, moved in about a year ago, my once decidedly dude bathroom changed: Now the counters are crammed with creams, the drawers packed with tools, the shower lined with pink, blue, and orange concoctions that look as if they came straight out of the Hogwarts spellbook. But after Trish complained that my scaly feet sliced her legs in bed at night, I decided I needed to clean up my act. Call it Operation: Exfoliate. Here's what I learned-and how you can use it to coax some metro-lite behavior out of your guy.</p><p><strong>No scent is better than the wrong scent</strong><br />Let's start by saying this: Guys just don't get the concept of body washes. Squeezing papaya goop onto a poufy thing and trying to lather it up seems unnecessary. And why would anyone want to smell like a smoothie? But <strong>Paul Mitchell Lemon Sage Energizing body wash</strong> has a citrusy zing that won't leave him feeling like he bathes at Jamba Juice. The total lack of scent, however, is what makes <strong>C.O. Bigelow's All-in-One Protective Day Lotion</strong> so great. The lotion sinks into the skin right away and makes it feel a lot smoother. Even better: the sunscreen will keep his face from going all Keith Richards before he hits 40.</p><p><strong>We're suckers for a good gimmick</strong><br />Read the fine print on the tube of <strong>Bliss Thermal Shaving Cream</strong> and you can't help but be intrigued: Warming sensation? Oh yeah. And trust me, this stuff will make his cheeks heat up like he's just finished a 15-K. Makes traditional shaving creams seem wimpy by comparison.</p> <p>And if your guy has never filed his nails, gift him with the <strong>Ace Nail File Pick</strong>. It looks like a giant guitar pick or some kind of ninja weapon (definitely more respectable than an emery board), and you know what that means: no more sweater-snagging, girl-parts-jabbing fingernails.</p><p><strong>A product needs to feel like it's doing something</strong><br />Most guys require shampoo to do two things: clean their hair and rinse down the drain. But <strong>John Frieda Root Awakening shampoo</strong> takes the experience up a notch. His scalp won't exactly feel an awakening, but he'll definitely enjoy the prolific suds, which make this shampoo look like it's working hard.</p><p>Of all the items in the product spectrum, exfoliants sync up most with the male need to handle problems with brute force. The <strong>Bioré Even Smoother Microderm Exfoliator</strong> will scour his face smooth, but the little particles won't leave his skin raw. Another totally satisfying guy experience: swiping a <strong>Phisoderm anti-blemish cleansing pad </strong>over his skin before bed. Nothing says ""mission accomplished"" better than brown residue on a white pad.</p> <p>One grooming area that doesn't appeal to most men: anti-aging. Your guy thinks, ""I'm going to get older, and old faces have wrinkles."" But <strong>Sircuit anti-aging serum</strong> is pretty impressive. A few drops make skin feel smooth and moisturized. And even if he's still not sold on the whole wrinkle angle, feeling better is enough, right?</p> <p><strong>It can't come with a user's manual</strong><br />Most guys pride themselves on the ability to get ready for anything-from a game of pick-up basketball to a black-tie wedding-in 20 minutes or less. It's the closest they'll ever get to having a superpower. That's why time-or the lack thereof-is why they don't use lotions. <strong>Eucerin Plus Soothing Essentials lotion</strong>, however, could make believers of us all. It comes in a pump bottle-easy application!-and it disappears into skin immediately. And last, a product that may become his new best friend: <strong>Barielle Heel and Callus Treatment Cream</strong> officially qualifies as a miracle cure. Before bed, have him layer on the stuff like cake frosting, then pull on thick socks (they help it sink in and keep it from messing up your sheets). He'll wake up with his feet transformed-no scales, no rough patches, no Nosferatu's talons. Who knows? His soles may end up so soft that you'll be tempted to offer nightly foot massages. Or not...</p>","relationships,skin"

I smile, and then we both start swimming for dear life along with the other 125 women in our group, or ""wave."" As I twist my head out of the water for air, the sun gleams in my eye, and I wish I had tinted goggles instead of clear. The distraction slows me down a bit. Then I remember what my gym lifeguard, Dave, told me when I was training: ""Give yourself to the water as you would to your bed."" In other words, relax. Nervousness means quick, short breaths, which don't keep you as buoyant as air-filled lungs.<br /><br />When my big sister Maria first asked me to sign up for this triathlon 10 weeks earlier, honestly, I laughed. I'm the athletic type who trips over the soccer ball instead of kicking it. Then again, the idea seemed so farfetched that I decided I had to prove to myself that I could. And it didn't hurt that the triathlon was the first-timer-friendly, all-women Danskin sprint tri - only a 0.5-mile swim, 11-mile bike ride, and 3.1-mile run - in nearby Sandy Hook, New Jersey.<br /><br />I knew swimming would be my weakest event, so I was at my gym pool every morning at 7:30 for 30 minutes. My first day in the water, Dave actually thought I was drowning - I could hardly clear a lap without gasping for air. I was also splashing more than kicking - which was why I wasn't going anywhere. He showed me how to rely mainly on my arms to propel myself and to use my legs for buoyancy and balance. As for running and biking, I figured I already had the skills - I mean, who forgets how to ride a bike, right? Riiight. It actually took several weekends of riding with my boyfriend, Mike, for me to feel totally comfortable again with starting, stopping, and just going fast. Once I realized I wasn't going to pitch headfirst over the handlebars, I learned to become one with my bike and, ultimately, the road.<br /><br />I'm swimming madly now, with the shore in sight. I get out and run barefoot past the spectators down a cold, hard paved road to the transition station - the designated area where everyone stows items for the next event, such as a bike, helmet, water bottles, towel, and sneakers. Maria's nowhere in sight, so I decide to wait for her by slowly putting on my socks and sneakers. (I find out later that this touching display of sisterly love cost me 6 whole minutes!) When she shows up, I lean in for a hug andshe yells, ""What are you doing?!<br /><br />Get out of here!"" And then it hits me: Shit, the clock is running!<br /><br />I gotta go!<br /><br />Pedaling along the flat bike course, I yell, ""On your left!"" - which really means ""Get outta my way!"" As I glide by, the other women shout back, ""You go, girl!"" - which I find incredibly empowering. Back at the transition station, I grab my visor and start the run. Adrenaline is all I'm riding on now, so I reach for the energy gel in the pocket of my trisuit (a swimsuit with built-in padded bike shorts). When I finally see the finish line in the distance, I sprint like a Kenyan for the big photo finish. I've completed my first sprint triathlon - in 1 hour and 46 minutes. With a shiny new medal around my neck (all racers get one), I smile and nod my head in disbelief. I can't believe I did it.<br /><br />Before that morning, I never would have called myself an athlete - let alone a triathlete. Now, 6 months later, I'm training for my first Olympic distance triathlon (double the length of a sprint).<br /><br />",Sports

She also was plagued by <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/what-you-should-know-about-your-heart"">high cholesterol</a> and chest pains. <br /><br /><b>The Change</b><br />At the end of 2007, Vernette was hit with a double whammy: She and her husband divorced, and she was laid off from her job as a mortgage processor. Though devastated, she says she saw it as an opportunity: ""I was tired of feeling sorry for myself. I wanted to change. And I could change every time I ate."" <br /><br /><b>The Lifestyle</b><br />Vernette started by cutting portions in half. ""I can still eat what I want and not feel deprived,"" she says. She cooked instead of going out, traded fried foods for steamed vegetables, and satisfied her sweet tooth with bits of <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/premium-packaged-foods?cat=9780&tip=10035"">dark chocolate</a> and dried fruit instead of nutritional zeros like pastries. In a few months, she was down to about 175 pounds and started going to a gym. As a kid, Vernette couldn't finish a lap around the track; now she plugged away on the treadmill, building speed and endurance. A few weeks later, she added weights to her workouts, and by the end of the summer of 2008, she was doing yoga and Pilates, too.

Ten years into her job, this 5'4"" former ""skinny girl with no curves"" was a size 16. It didn't help that her chef husband, Tafari, worked the late shift and brought home fried chicken or tacos at 10 p.m. that Sherise would share despite having eaten earlier. She ignored her doctor's advice to lose weight until she hit an all-time high of 205 pounds in the summer of 2009.<br /><br /><b>The Change</b><br />Because her weight gain was so gradual, Sherise didn't realize just how many pounds she'd tacked on. That is, until she flipped through a photo album from her wedding-anniversary cruise in the Bahamas and spotted a shot of herself in a red halter dress. ""Curves are good, but I didn't like the way those curves looked,"" she says.<br /><br /><b>The Lifestyle</b><br />Sherise joined a gym that December and took advantage of a free personal-training session that came with her membership. She found it was just the motivation she needed and signed up for 12 more weeks of training. ""I wasn't sure what to do at the gym, and my trainer gave me a plan to follow,"" she says. ""Plus, I had someone to hold me accountable."" Sherise began walking or running on a treadmill at a high incline five days a week and lifting weights three days a week. Her trainer also urged her to pay more attention to what she ate. Sherise started having breakfast (which she'd always skipped), and at lunch and dinner she filled half her plate with salad, a quarter with chicken or fish, and the other quarter with steamed veggies or healthy carbs. She soon discovered that her body was now rejecting the fatty foods she once loved. ""If I snagged some of my sons' french fries, I'd feel sick later,"" she says.<br /><br />Three months in, she had dropped 25 pounds and toned up. ""I used to be self-conscious about my chicken-wing arms, but now that I've tightened them up, I love my arms!"" she says. She even won a gym competition by losing 5 percent of her body weight and spent the $60 prize money on smaller workout clothes.<br /><br /><b>The Reward</b><br />In October, Sherise set sail with her husband on another cruise, and this time she didn't dread the vacation photos. At a svelte 140 pounds, she sported a tankini. ""For the first time, I enjoyed buying clothing for a trip,"" she says. ""It felt incredible to buy size-6 shorts."" And that dress from the Bahamas? ""I can't wear it now-it falls off me.""<br /><br /><b>Sherise's Tips</b><br /><i>Chew out cravings.</i><br />""When everyone around me is eating junk, I pop a stick of sugarless gum into my mouth to stave off cravings. I keep a pack in my car, desk, gym bag, and jacket so I'm always armed.""<br /><br /><i>Never be list-less.</i><br />""Keep a copy of your grocery list with you at all times so you can jot down healthy items to buy.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/sex-tips-1,Sex And Relationships,5,10,3,7,1,0,3,0,,The Female Orgasm Revealed!,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0907-couple-intimate.jpg,"<p>Ask a man what the magic formula is for turning on a woman sexually and you're likely to be met with a heaving shrug. For years, scientists have been just as perplexed. And to a large degree, female arousal has mystified even women themselves. The only consensus: the female mind, heart, and genitals all need to be in on the effort in order for arousal to occur. But recently, a handful of sex researchers have gotten on the case--and their fascinating findings will show you <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/have-better-sex-1"">how to have better sex</a>.</p><p><b>What SHE Responds To</b><br />One of the most intriguing research nuggets to emerge: While male sexuality is fairly predictable--they tend to be aroused by naked women and naked women hooking up with other naked women--female sexuality is stimulated by a surprisingly wide array of turn-ons. Meredith Chivers, Ph. D., an assistant professor of psychology at Queens University in Kingston, Ontario, calls this ""the nonspecificity of women's <a target=""_self"" href=""/sex-and-relationships/sex-tips-0"">sexual arousal</a>."" Chivers created a buzz with a study in which she showed both men and women a variety of sexually explicit images--nude male and female bodies, heterosexual and homosexual sex, and sex between bonobos (a particularly frisky species of ape)--while measuring physiological signs of genital arousal as well as their subjective feelings of desire. </p><p>For the guys, the findings were straightforward enough: The straight men in the study were physically aroused by women, gay men were aroused by men, and neither group felt any stirrings for the apes. The men's physical reactions (erections) were in agreement with what they reported being turned on by. </p><p>The women in the study, on the other hand, didn't react as predictably. While they reported feeling <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/get-your-libido-back"">aroused</a> in the ways you might expect (straight women were turned on by men, lesbians by women), measurements of their vaginal blood flow showed that they were physically aroused by all the forms of coupling they saw--even the bonobos. Still, when asked after viewing them to report which images they found titillating, most of them chose only those which matched up with their sexual orientation. Were they lying? </p><p>Not exactly. The women in Chivers's study were aroused by all the images--but that doesn't mean they desired to have sex with the people (or animals) they saw. ""Women have the capacity to get turned on by a broad range of things,"" she says. ""This is normal and not necessarily a challenge to sexual identity."" </p><p>Lori Brotto, Ph. D., an assistant professor in the University of British Columbia's gynecology department and the director of its Sexual Health Laboratory, has been studying how the disconnect between women's bodies and brains comes into play during sex with a partner. ""Women report thinking about nonsexual things during sex,"" she says. Many women wonder things like ""When am I going to get to the gym?"" or ""What am I going to wear to work tomorrow?"" The problem is, focusing on future-oriented matters interferes with women's ability to feel either desire or arousal. </p><p>Brotto offers two possible explanations: ""Women are consummate multitaskers, and society rewards this ability."" Women have become so good at doing a million things at once--talking on the phone, cooking dinner, watching TV, reading a magazine--that it often becomes hard to slow it down or turn it off during sex and just enjoy the moment. Sound familiar? </p><p>There's a physical explanation, too. As counter-intuitive as this may sound, men are more in tune with their bodies than women are. Guys typically notice and touch their genitals at a younger age (by virtue of the fact that a boy's are more visible than a girl's). They also begin masturbating earlier. ""Because of this, their brains notice changes in their bodies more quickly,"" Brotto explains, ""whereas women's bodies can be very excited and their minds don't notice it at all."" </p><p>Or sometimes it's just that the mind takes a while to catch up. Ever since sex researchers William Masters and Virginia Johnson revolutionized thinking about human sexual function and dysfunction in the 1950s and 1960s, conventional wisdom has held that there's a linear progression: People feel desire and then become aroused; the physical sensations intensify and it all ends with one big earth-shattering <a target=""_self"" href=""/sex-and-relationships/have-better-sex-0"">orgasm</a>. </p><p>But current research is showing that for some women, desire doesn't necessarily come first. The sexual contact may be what gets you in the mood. ""When a woman's partner initiates sex, she may feel indifferent to it at first,"" says psychologist Sandra Leiblum, Ph. D., director of sexual and relationship services at the New Jersey Center for Sexual Wellness. She may be stressed or tired or, to Brotto's point, focusing on a million other things. ""But often, if she plays along she starts to feel aroused, and then the desire kicks in,"" Leiblum says. </p><p>To help women sync up their brains with their bodies, Brotto has begun teaching the art of mindfulness. The idea is to enable women to stay focused on sex by integrating the physical with the mental so that mental excitement can heighten physical arousal and vice versa. To try it at home, Brotto suggests spending 10 minutes a day paying very close attention to any activity--walking the dog, washing dishes, drinking a cup of coffee. ""Focus on any sensations in your body--notice the placement of your feet, the positioning of your hands,"" she says. ""What do you see, smell, taste, hear?"" If you become distracted, guide your mind back to the present. (To achieve this, imagine putting your wandering thoughts on a conveyor belt and watching them slowly roll away). </p><p>Brotto advises next getting familiar with your body by examining and touching yourself during or after a shower, experimenting with what feels good. When you're ready, work toward incorporating the focusing exercise while you're aroused, either alone or with your partner. Eventually you'll become attuned to what you're feeling during sex rather than letting your thoughts escape the bedroom. </p><p>A slightly different aspect of desire has been the focus of studies by University of Utah psychologist Lisa Diamond, Ph. D. She's been interviewing a group of roughly 100 women for nearly 15 years, asking them questions about changes in their sexual cravings and reactions over time. ""Many women feel that desire is fluid and based on who they're coming into contact with,"" Diamond says. ""Desire is often the result of an emotional connection."" In some cases, that connection can be a close friendship--even one with another woman. </p><p>One of Diamond's subjects is a straight woman who became intimate with her female roommate. ""When I first interviewed her,"" Diamond recalls, ""she said, 'I've always been heterosexual, but just last week I got involved with a woman who's been my best friend since I was 12.'"" When the two shared an apartment, emotional intimacy spilled over into physical intimacy. </p><p>Diamond has been grappling with the question of why some friendships take a turn toward the physical while most don't, and she's drawn some preliminary conclusions. In cases where both women identify themselves as heterosexual, a series of what she calls ""situational factors"" come into play. One is relationship status: If neither woman has a boyfriend, they're more likely to become strongly emotionally invested in the friendship. The other is proximity: There's something very powerful about spending a lot of time together--as roommates, travel partners, or close colleagues, Diamond says. The woman in the study ended up in a two-year relationship with the roommate, after which she went back to sleeping with men. ""It's been 10 years since that happened, and she's pretty certain she's still heterosexual,"" Diamond says. ""The attraction was real, but it wasn't representative of her sexual orientation."" </p><p>Diamond's research reiterates the fact that female desire defies easy categorization. University of Nevada psychologist Marta Meana, Ph. D., also studies why women seem to be attracted to other women in certain circumstances, but she has a different take on why. Meana originally set out to see how men's and women's visual attention patterns differ from one another when they look at erotic images--in this case, very sexy shots of nearly naked people in a panoply of sexual positions. Meana outfitted her research subjects with eye-tracking goggles, which measured eye movement per millisecond. (""Our eyes are constantly darting around,"" Meana says. ""It's essentially impossible to control, so you get this really nice data that's not influenced by social acceptability."") Then she showed them each picture for 10 seconds. </p><p>The result: ""Men barely looked at the guy in the picture. They spent most of their time looking at the women. In women, there was an almost 50-50 split."" Meana doesn't know for sure why women's eyes were drawn equally to the men and women in the photos. She acknowledges that they may have been turned on by images of other women, but she thinks it's more likely that they were trying to measure themselves up--a finding supported by some of her previous research, which found that sexual desire boils down to how a woman feels about herself; specifically, how she feels about her body. </p><p>""There is a relational component to female sexuality and there's a very self-focused component,"" she says. ""I don't mean that negatively. Women have to be convinced that they are desirable in order to believe that anyone else finds them desirable."" Think about it this way: If you haven't been in the mood lately, it might be because you're feeling unattractive (gained a few pounds, noticed your breasts sagging, spotted a new dimple of cellulite), and figure your man couldn't possibly think you look hot. </p><p>In her private counseling practice, Meana sees many couples in which the woman ""will completely avoid certain sex positions because she's embarrassed by how she thinks her body looks. But the husband hasn't even thought of that. He's shocked '<i>That</i>'s why you won't get on top? Because you think your breasts sag?!'"" </p><p>Sometimes, the key to better sex might be repairing your relationship with yourself. There's no one-size-fits- all solution, but Meana works with her patients to help them figure out what would make them feel desirable. For some women, it might be as easy as buying sexy lingerie. For others, it might be overcoming physical insecurities by adopting a new workout routine. ""The strategies can range from manicures to college degrees,"" Meana says. One thing she doesn't recommend, though, is dimming the lights during sex (even using candlelight!) as a way to avoid worrying about your looks. ""This kind of behavior simply reinforces negative self-image,"" she says. </p><p>Meana's research may be easier to digest than Chivers's or Diamond's, both of which point out women's potential to desire some rather shocking things. But according to Leiblum, all of these theories are loosely connected. ""Desire and arousal are predicated on so many factors,"" she says--things like the nature of our relationships, our attitudes toward ourselves and toward sex, our general health, our hormone levels. The bottom line: ""There's no one right path to desire or arousal. You can feel these because you have an intense emotional relationship with another person. Or maybe you're looking at sexy pictures and something gets triggered. There are many roads to Rome."" </p><p>Regardless of their particular take on the subject, all the researchers offer the same advice: Don't worry about how you're supposed to feel. ""Is this normal?"" is the wrong question. The right ones might be ""Does this feel right?"" or ""Does this feel good?"" If it does, don't over-think it--open your mind and just go with the moment. Indulging in what your body and mind naturally crave doesn't necessarily define sexual interest, but it may pave the way to even more self-discovery about what turns you on...and makes your toes curl.<br /></p>",

According to the nation's top fitness experts, three things are likely to stand in your way. First, droopy posture: Standing tall makes you look leaner instantly. Next, excess belly fat: It doesn't just hide your abs; it's a health hazard, too. And finally, limited mobility caused by not varying your routine: bed, car, desk, reverse, repeat. </p><p>We know it's not your style to walk away from a challenge, so we turned these roadblocks into the defining goals of our new-and-improved Women's Health Ultimate Fitness Plan. Follow the three-month program outlined here) and you'll lose weight, <a href=""/Shape%20Up:%20Ultimate%20Fitness%20Plan%202009"">shape up</a>, tone up, demolish stress, and feel your energy skyrocket.</p><p><b>Goal 1: Stand up straight!</b><br />Sitting is murder on your posture. And these days we do it more than ever. A 2007 survey by Vanderbilt University's Institute for Medicine and Public Health found that women spend nearly eight hours a day parked on their fannies, often hunched over a keyboard or slumped on the sofa. ""When women do get off the couch, they spend hours working on their 'beach' muscles, like the chest, abs, and quads, and neglect posterior muscles, like the traps, back, hamstrings, and glutes,"" says trainer and coach Kevin Buckley, owner of Dynamic Strength and Conditioning in Nashua, New Hampshire. The result is muscle imbalance that doesn't just look bad (saggy buns are never pretty) but also prevents your body from operating optimally. </p><p>Get There: <a href=""/fitness/good-posture"">Improve posture</a> and bolster your backside with strength moves that target your entire posterior chain, the muscles that run from the back of your head to your heels. These include the erector spinae, which are cable-like muscles that flank your spine from your bum to the base of your skull; they keep your vertebrae properly stacked as you bend and twist. Then there are the glutes, the largest muscles in your body, and the hamstrings, the set of three muscles that run diagonally across the backs of your thighs. Your glutes give you the power to run without toppling over, while your hamstrings keep your hips stable so you can, say, bend forward to curb your pooch without falling on your face. At the bottom of the chain are the calves, which protect your knees from excess pressure. The Ultimate Fitness Plan hits all of these muscles so you can improve your posture, hone your balance, and tone up your tush.</p><p><b>Goal 2: Bulletproof your body!</b><br />One of the top 10 workout trends of 2008, according to the American Council on Exercise, was ""functional fitness""--­training by doing movements that mimic activities typically done outside of the gym. This is good news, because too many women still follow the old bodybuilder model of training, isolating individual muscles with moves like bicep curls or tricep kickbacks. They may make you look good when you stand still and flex for the mirror, but those narrow-minded moves don't help you bend and twist in ways that are actually useful. Think about it: How often do you bench-press your groceries? In reality, lugging produce recruits muscles from all over your body--legs, back, shoulders--and you need to train them to work together.</p><p>Get There: Do workouts that imitate real life. To build lean muscle; burn fat; increase strength, endurance, and range of motion; and stay injury-free, opt for functional-fitness moves: Instead of moving a weight up and down, in and out, for instance, pull it diagonally across your body as if you were lifting your shopping bags out of the backseat. That way, you train your muscles to work together, in all planes of motion. ""Traditional bodybuilding is designed to add bulk, which no woman wants, and it limits your range of motion,"" Buckley says. ""With functional fitness, the result is a lean, athletic body that looks fantastic and is built for performance.""</p><p><b>Goal 3: Banish belly fat!</b><br />The average woman's waist circumference has been growing for 15 years and now hovers at a dangerous 37 inches. Belly fat does more than make those Rock & Republics impossible to snap. Because it's linked to heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, excess belly fat can wreck your health.</p><p>Get There: Do speed intervals. A study from Canada found that exercisers who did 30-minute workouts that included short, hard efforts lost three times as much fat in 15 weeks as their peers who performed steady-paced, easier workouts for 45 minutes. ""Technically, you burn more fat as fuel during low-intensity exercise,"" explains researcher Jason Talanian, Ph.D., who did a series of studies on interval training at the University of Guelph in Ontario. ""But you become a better fat burner overall [even when resting] by raising your fitness ceiling, which you do by going fast."" Specifically, Talanian found that interval training increases your cells' fat-frying ability by up to 50 percent. And because they're harder to do than pokey one-speed workouts, your body takes longer to return to normal after you're done (meaning you keep torching calories long after you've showered). As a belly-busting bonus, vigorous exercise lowers stress, says sports conditioning specialist Scott H. Mendelson, owner of Infinity Fitness outside Columbus, Ohio. ""Stress hormones like cortisol are a known contributor to abdominal fat.""</p><p><a href=""/fitness/2009-ultimate-fitness-plan-workout-1""></a></p><a href=""/fitness/2009-ultimate-fitness-plan-workout-1""><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/images/buttons/gettheworkout_bttn.gif"" /><br /><br /></a><p></p><p></p>",
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/safe-tap-water,Health,4,10,2,0,0,1,0,0,,Is Your Tap Water Safe?,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0711-is-your-tap-1967.jpg,"It's easy to think you're doing a body good by trading tap water for the bottled kind -- after all, isn't that what makes Jennifer Aniston look all svelte and glowy in those SmartWater ads? In fact, one survey from the American Water Works Association Research Foundation found that 56 percent of Americans who drink bottled water buy it because they're afraid their tap water isn't healthful or safe.<br /><br />""Bottled water is popular because it's convenient,"" says Peter Gleick, Ph.D., president of the Pacific Institute, a nonprofit think tank focusing on environmental issues. ""But aggressive ad campaigns promote it as better for you than tap. Therefore, people, rightly or wrongly -- and we believe wrongly -- are afraid of what comes from their faucet.""<br /><br />To end the confusion, here's a rundown of what's bad and good about tap water, and how to make sure what's in your glass is as pristine as possible.<br /><br /><b>THE BAD</b><br /><br /><b>It could make you sick</b><br />Like your sneaking suspicion that the IT guy at work reads your e-mails, fears about tap water aren't entirely unfounded. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 30 to 40 outbreaks of waterborne diseases from viruses, bacteria, and parasites in the U.S. each year -- and about half can be attributed to drinking water. While a few are serious, most result in minor problems, such as fever and diarrhea. Which means your last bout of ""food poisoning"" may have come from your water glass, not your moo shu pork.<br /><br /><b>It's not totally clean</b><br />""It's virtually impossible to make any water -- bottled or tap -- completely free of contaminants,"" says Daniel Giammar, Ph.D., assistant professor of environmental engineering at Washington University in St. Louis. Most often, the amounts of chemicals found in tap water are minute, but if they do get too high, they can be harmful -- particularly if you're exposed for a long time.<br /><br />For instance, if the pipes in or leading to your home are older than the kids in High School Musical, they may leak lead, copper, or other impurities, which can't be monitored or filtered by your area's water supplier. ""Lead typically ends up in water after it's transferred through old pipes that are decaying,"" explains Gina Solomon, M.D., M.P.H., a senior scientist and physician with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).<br /><br />Virtually all municipalities use chlorine to purify water, and that can pose health problems. ""Studies have tied high levels of chlorine byproducts to an increased risk of miscarriage,"" Dr. Solomon says. And there are plenty of potentially harmful chemicals the government doesn't require your local water supplier to monitor. A landmark 2005 study of tap water in 42 states by the Environmental Working Group found more than 140 unregulated chemicals, including MTBE, a gasoline additive, and phthalates, a group of compounds used to make plastic. In 19 cases, water contaminants exceeded safe limits, though in many other instances, the EPA hadn't set limits, since these chemicals aren't regulated.<br /><br /><b>It's worse in small towns or rural areas</b><br />Although big municipal water supplies aren't perfect, they are generally the best, says Charles Gerba, Ph.D., professor of environmental microbiology at the University of Arizona, Tucson. Conversely, he says, ""water systems that serve fewer than 10,000 people tend to have far greater problems with contamination because the funding needed to keep these facilities and their testing up-to-date often isn't available.""<br /><br />If you're one of the 43.5 million Americans who drink from a well, ""the big problem is [potentially toxic] nitrates, which often get into the water from leaking septic tanks and fertilizers,"" Dr. Solomon says. Nitrates have been linked to problems such as kidney disease and miscarriage.<br /><br /><b>THE GOOD</b><br /><br /><b>It's regulated more rigorously than bottled</b><br />Even in small towns, municipal tap water generally goes through more screening than Lindsay Lohan's blood-alcohol levels. Suppliers may take hundreds of samples daily. ""When a testing facility finds a contaminant, such as lead, they remove it before the water is shipped to your home,"" Gerba says. Plus, municipal water is overseen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has more regulatory oversight than the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which oversees standards for bottled water. The FDA, by contrast, tests water from bottling plants less frequently (usually just once a week), and its criteria for bacteria and parasites in bottled water are more lax, according to a 1999 report from the NRDC. ""It's not that bottled water is dangerous,"" Gleick says. ""But tap water is held to higher safety standards.""<br /><br /><b>It's better for the environment</b><br />Every time you drink bottled water, you're doing serious damage to your tree-hugger cred. ""It takes three to four times the amount of water in the bottle just to make the plastic for the bottle,"" Gleick says. ""And that's not including how much oil is used and how much carbon dioxide is created when the water is shipped to the store.""<br /><br /><b>It's much less expensive</b><br />Two dollars for 24 ounces doesn't seem outrageous, but when you compare it with the amount of money you can save drinking tap, you're looking at the difference between a Gucci clutch and a paper bag. ""Gallon for gallon, bottled water costs more than gasoline,"" Dr. Solomon says. And in some cases, you're paying for little more than the bottle itself: At least 25 percent (some experts say as much as 40 percent) of bottled water is nothing more than processed tap water. Beverage companies aren't legally required to disclose the source of their water, although Aquafina -- the most popular bottled brand in the U.S. -- recently agreed to begin labeling its water as ""municipally sourced."" ""If it doesn't say 'spring water,' chances are it comes from the same or a similar source as tap water,"" Gleick says.<br /><br /><b>CLEARING THINGS UP</b><br /><br />The truth is, most tap water is pretty darn safe -- and in the end, drinking it is better for the earth and for your purse. In fact, every expert we interviewed guzzles tap water most of the time. ""Millions of people in the U.S. drink tap water every day and stay perfectly healthy,"" Giammar says. ""We've got some of the best water in the world.""<br /><br />To make sure yours is as pure as possible, do this:<br /><br /><b>1. Get a water report</b><br />By law, your water supplier must mail you one annually. If it doesn't, call and request one. (If you don't know your supplier, visit <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.epa.gov/safewater/ccr/whereyoulive.html"">epa.gov/safewater/ccr/whereyoulive.html</a>.) Once you have a copy of the report, find the chart that lists potential contaminants and look for the column marked ""violation"" or ""exceeds limits,"" Giammar says. If you see a check mark or a ""yes,"" consider buying a filter to remove those impurities.<br /><br /><b>2. Test your tap water</b><br />Buy a home-testing kit. Most DIY tests provide strips or small vials that change color for easy-to-read results. Look for one that measures bacteria, nitrates, lead, and chlorine, such as Watersafe's All-in-One ($20, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.discovertesting.com"">discovertesting.com</a> or <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.amazon.com"">amazon.com</a>). If you have a well or old pipes that could be leaching chemicals, it's best to have your water tested by a local lab or your county's cooperative extension program.<br /><br /><b>3. Buy a filter</b><br />Filtering your water is a good idea no matter what, but it's crucial if you have young children, are pregnant, or have a chronic illness that affects your immune system. ""Even if your city or town has extremely good water quality, it can't hurt. Think of it as a safety net,"" Dr. Solomon says. If your water is from a well, Dr. Solomon suggests a charcoal filtration system, which removes both bacteria and chemical pollutants.<br /><br /><b>4. Filter your shower water</b><br />""Even chlorine levels that are below the EPA limit can dry skin and worsen conditions such as eczema and psoriasis,"" says Karyn Grossman, M.D., chief of the dermatology division at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. To remove chlorine, she recommends installing a filter that attaches to your showerhead, such as the iWater Shower Purification System ($50, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.myiwater.com"">myiwater.com</a>).<br /><br /><b>5. Take it with you</b><br />To make tap water more convenient for travel, put it in a washable stainless-steel bottle, such as the Klean Kanteen ($20, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.REI.com"">REI.com</a>). Water bottles made of regular plastic, when reused, can harbor bacteria, and they aren't made to withstand the heat of a dishwasher.<br /><br /><b>6. Buy domestic</b><br />If you can't break your bottled-water addiction, ""look for a brand that hasn't been shipped across the world,"" Dr. Solomon says. ""The less distance the water has to travel, the fewer greenhouse gases are produced.""<br />",Be In The Know

We did the math and figured out that, per year, that adds up to ...<br /><br />Uh, actually we had a little trouble with the math. <br /><br />But we do know this: Women have sex a lot - but still understand relatively little about what's really happening between the sheets. No, we don't mean where the body parts go. We mean more vexing matters. Like why do some things turn us on and some things turn us off? <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/vagina-information"">Why do our bodies work </a>the way they do? And, of course, why do men have nipples?<br /><br />Fortunately, there are people who know about these things - and we talked to a batch of them. Don't consider your sex education complete until you know...<br /><br /><b>Why We Sometimes Cry (or Laugh) After Sex</b><br /><br />Perhaps it's your partner's insistence on humming Celine Dion songs during intercourse, but more likely it's a physiological reaction. ""An <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/sex-advice-0"">orgasm</a> instigates the release of powerful hormones, such as dopamine, epinephrine, and oxytocin, all of which rile the emotions,"" says Pepper Schwartz, Ph.D., author of <i>Everything You Know About Love and Sex Is Wrong</i>. The good news: You should consider giggles (or tears) a reassuring sign about the status of your relationship. If getting physical with someone can move you that much, it's probably because you have a profound, intimate relationship. <br /><br /><b>Why Boots Make Us Feel Like Bad Girls</b><br /><br />There is an indescribable transformation that takes place when a woman steps into a pair of knee-high boots, whether they have chunky soles or spiked 3-inch heels. Images of Wonder Woman, go-go dancers, and <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/turn-him-on?page=1"">rock stars</a> flash across our subconscious, not to mention soldiers, revolutionaries, royalty, and pirates. In short, we feel and look like a badass. ""There's an enormous amount of symbolism in the tall boot that we register immediately,"" says Gloria Brame, Ph.D., a sex therapist based in Athens, Georgia. ""Because of their historical associations, boots give us a feeling of added protection while at the same time increasing our sense of power - and that translates into a very sexy feeling that's almost predatory."" Grrrowl!<br /><br /><b>Why We're Not the Only Ones in the Relationship with Nipples</b><br /><br />In the very first stages of life, every fetus starts out as a female. ""Males only become males with the addition of greater amounts of testosterone, which suppresses the development of female sex organs,"" says Sandor Gardos, licensed sex therapist and founder of mypleasure.com. Hard evidence for that fact can be found about a quarter of the way down Johnny Depp's chest in the form of two round, pinkish milk ducts. Nearly all mammalian embryos are decked out with mammary tissue from the get-go in preparation for future motherhood. So behind Johnny's nipples lie the dusty, unused pipes and machinery that would have been used to breastfeed little Johnny Jr. <br /><br /><b>Why the Clitoris is Like an Iceberg</b><br /><br />Simple, really: You see only the tip. Attached to that euphoric pink knob (which, by the way, packs 8,000 nerve endings - twice as many as the penis) is a shaft three times its size. During arousal, this shaft fills with blood and pushes the knob out from under its hood. And that's not all. Attached to the base of the shaft are two arms that descend in a wishbone shape down the sides of the labia and back toward the thigh muscles. There are also two ""bulbs"" of erectile tissue located on either side of the vaginal opening. The going theory is that they help transmit sensation from the vagina to the clitoris. During the last stages of arousal, the domino effect sets in and electrifies just about every nerve ending below your belly button. <br /><br /><b>Why Their Balls Get Blue </b><br /><br />You've no doubt heard a guy complain of having ""blue balls"" after a night of frantic groping that didn't go all the way. He wasn't kidding. ""It's possible for the scrotum to appear slightly blueish if a man has been aroused for a very long period of time,"" Gardos says. During arousal, blood fills the entire genital area and stays there for as long as a person remains turned on. The longer it's there, the less oxygen it has, and blood with less oxygen is more blue than red. The result: azure-tinted testicles.<br /><br /><b>Why He Wakes Up with a Woody</b><br /><br />There it is again, all up-and-at-'em at 7 A.M. It's a wonder you bother using an alarm clock. ""Men tend to awake with an erection in the morning because that's when their testosterone levels peak,"" Gardos says. Physically, his upstanding member is just as sensitive as ever, but because he isn't psychologically turned on, he may not feel any urge to put it to use. And if you do get it on in the early hours, expect a quickie - all that testosterone usually leads to a quick resolution.<br /><br /><b>Why Fat, Hairy Men Display Their Bodies Proudly on the Beach (But We Won't Even Have Sex with the Lights On)</b><br /><br />There you are enjoying the sand, sun, and sound of the waves, when along strolls a Jack Black look-alike in a Speedo. As your eyes accidentally meet, he smiles and winks. He couldn't be more comfortable with his pudge and bulges. Meanwhile, you refuse to sit at a 90-degree angle for fear of a half-inch roll of fat appearing in your midsection. ""There's a core contingent of guys who were taught to believe that a man's looks aren't anywhere near as important as his money or status,"" Dr. Brame says. In other words, when Donald Trump looks in the mirror, he sees the male equivalent of Beyonce staring back. Because these plus-size guys don't associate their self-worth with a six-pack, they don't care if the lights are on, the sheets are off, and the flesh is everywhere. But rather than criticize them for being out of shape, let's salute them as a dying breed of human who has yet to crack under all that pressure to look perfect. <br /><br /><b>Why Heidi Klum is Hot To Men and Women</b><br /><br />If lingerie models in lacy G-strings make you think of more than a Victoria's Secret sale, you're not alone. Plenty of women find feminine curves sexually alluring. It has nothing to do with your sexual orientation. It's actually a preconditioned gut reaction. ""As we grow up, both men and women are taught to view women's bodies as sexual symbols,"" Dr. Schwartz says. ""When we see an attractive woman in a bikini or an actress in a tight dress and high heels, our brain instantly associates those images with sex."" For a lot of us girls, though, it prompts a flood of far less sexy thoughts like, ""I wonder if she does yoga or Pilates?"" that often causes that spark to quickly fizzle. <br /><br /><b>Why We Should Dial ""O"" on the Pink Telephone</b><br /><br />Beating the bishop, waxing the dolphin, spanking the monkey - there's no end to the euphemisms for male masturbation. So why not for women? ""Society is more permissive with males, both in what they can do sexually and how they can talk about their sexual behaviors,"" says Yvonne Fulbright, author of <i>The Hot Guide to Safer Sex</i>. Indeed, most boys start stimulating themselves silly by age 13. Girls are slower to start exploring and hardly ever talk about it openly until they're well into their 20s, if ever. But there's hope, as women start to loosen up and make light of what happens when they're alone and horny. ""Every year more and more women are browsing for vibrators as comfortably as they would beauty products,"" says Claire Cavanah of the sex boutique Toys in Babeland. Some slang terms she's hearing for female masturbation: polish your pearl, pet your bunny, water your flower, paddle the pink canoe, tiptoe through the two lips, and dial ""O"" on the pink telephone. <br /><br /><b>Why This Magazine Isn't Packed with Viagra Ads</b><br /><br />When a woman pops a Viagra, it has the same physical effect as when a man takes one. Blood rushes to her genitals, causing vaginal swelling that's identical to arousal. The difference is that when a guy gets a hard-on, he instantly craves sex. Getting a woman in the mood is far more complicated. ""Very few women have sexual difficulty because of a lack of blood flow,"" says Jed Kaminetsky, M.D., clinical assistant professor of urology at New York University. ""The two most common problems are lack of desire and difficulty with orgasm, and they involve everything from relationship issues to self-esteem to hormone fluctuations."" So forget the miracle pill for now. We'll have to continue to make do with dimming the lights and downing a martini. <br /><br /><b>Why Sex Leaves Us Soaring, Not Snoring</b><br /><br />Women complain about guys passing out the second sex is over. But don't whine - gloat. For him, the rush ends abruptly. For you, sex isn't over even when it's over. ""It can take us anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes to come down from an orgasm,"" says Fulbright, ""with bodily changes including reduced breast swelling, the clitoris returning to its normal position, a shrinking uterus and 'deflating' of the vagina, and a return to our resting pulse rate, blood pressure, and breathing."" Talk about a full-body workout. <br /><br /><b>Why Our Peak is Harder to Reach Than Theirs</b><br /><br />The <i>Seinfeld</i> episode in which Elaine coins the term ""sponge-worthy"" isn't far off: Every guy might not be orgasm-worthy. ""There's a very interesting new idea about female orgasm called the 'upsuck theory,'"" says Deborah Blum, author of <i>Sex on the Brain</i>. The gist is that when a woman climaxes, the muscles of her vagina pull upward, helping semen to reach her uterus and increasing the odds of pregnancy. Some evolutionary biologists suggest that the female orgasm acts as a quality-control mechanism, preventing women from having children with men they don't feel strongly about. If sex with a certain guy hardly ever ends in fireworks, perhaps it's nature's way of saying he's not what you want in a husband and father. If you go off like a cannon every other night, you just might be dating Mr. Right.<br /><br /><b>Why You Can Finally Stop Looking for Your G-Spot</b><br /><br />It's named after Dr. Ernst Gräfenberg who, in 1950, reported that some of his female patients experienced intense pleasure when an area on the front wall of their vagina was stimulated. Since then, large numbers of women have reported having ""G-spot orgasms."" The only problem is that scientists can't quite figure out what's causing them. ""One camp of experts believe that the G-spot is the place where the roots of the clitoris crisscross the urethral sponge,"" Fulbright says. ""Others believe that, similar to the male prostate gland, it's its own entity."" And then there are those like Terrence Hines, Ph.D., who, in an article published in <i>The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology</i> in 2001, described it as ""a sort of gynecologic UFO: much searched for, much discussed, but unverified by objective means."" Either way, what's important to know is that the area around the front wall of the vagina isn't always an erogenous zone. So if you've gone looking for your G-spot but haven't felt so much as a tingle, that's perfectly normal. <br /><br /><b>What Our Bodies Have in Common with the Liver of a Shark</b><br /><br />Let's discuss vaginal lubrication for a moment, shall we? Turns out it's comprised of a daunting list of ingredients, from water and lactic acid to squalene, which can also be found in sharks' livers. ""Each component contributes to maintaining the delicate balance between yeast and bacteria inside the vagina,"" Gardos says. (He had nothing to add about the shark thing.) As for where it comes from, the answer is through the vaginal walls. ""The action is similar to sweating,"" Gardos says. ""The walls of the vagina are constantly emitting moisture to keep the tissue healthy, and during arousal that amount increases."" Some women get soaked, others are just slippery enough for action. A lack of lubrication is typically caused by hormone changes, dehydration, or a guy who hasn't grasped the importance of foreplay. <br /><br /><b>Why Our Wildest Fantasies Involve Gladiators</b><br /><br />There you are, innocently strolling along in a field of poppies in a sheer white dress. Suddenly you're surrounded by a small army of Russell Crowe look-alikes who haven't had a woman in years ... From there the fantasy goes beyond what any R rating would allow. How is it that something that, in reality, would be so shocking could seem so enticing in our imaginations? ""Because fantasies, no matter how wild they get, always remain within our control,"" Dr. Brame says. ""Therefore there's no real threat, so you can safely surrender to the illusion."" Contrary to what you would think, the fact that rape fantasies are fairly popular among women makes a lot of sense to sex therapists. ""Women are often made to feel guilty or shameful for wanting or enjoying sex,"" Dr. Brame says. ""In a rape fantasy, you aren't responsible for what's happening, and that alleviates the guilt."" <br />",Better Sex

I guess I just wished myself luck, since I will be with you - 4ever! <br /><br />I wrote that on page 108 of my high school sweetheart's yearbook under a photo of me, with Duran Duran hair, hugging her. The yellowing yearbook is in my possession now, which leads me to believe this was one of the items she tossed at my head when our <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/relationship-advice-0"">relationship</a> broke up that fall.<br /><br /> There was a lot to love about that girl: her unabashed optimism, her adventurous spirit, her dad - who, as town judge, once dismissed a speeding ticket I got. I even told her I loved her. But I was 17. As with drinking and voting, there should be a minimum age requirement for that particular declaration. And when I think about all that I know now about love, I can't count her as my first. After 10 years in the <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/fear-of-commitment"">dating</a> game, and after dropping the L word hundreds of times, who is my first love? Turns out, she's the last person I dated: my wife, Diana. <br /><br />True love is like your first kidney stone. You can't possibly imagine what it feels like until it strikes you to the ground (I speak from experience, because I've passed enough kidney stones to pave a small driveway). After 10 minutes of talking to Diana, I knew that the knee-buckling, heart-throbbing, butterfly-inducing feeling I had was <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/relationship-advice"">love</a>. And since this is the only time I've felt that, I have to conclude she's my first. To equate this feeling with other ""loves"" in my past only diminishes its meaning. It's like calling that kidney stonea ""stummy ache.""<br /><br />So what separates Diana from the rest? For one, we don't have to work hard at love. We laugh at each other's jokes, finish each other's sentences, know when to snuggle and when to give each other space. Sure, it bugs her that I never remember to replace the toilet paper roll, and it annoys me that she still can't work the TiVo. But I think she's eternally beautiful and unfailingly fascinating. Even when she talks about getting her nails done, I'm riveted. (People, is that normal?) Past relationships were lopsided, complicated, exhaustingly emotional tugs-of-war. That isn't the case with Diana and me; we have struck a perfect balance. <br /><br />They say you never forget your first love. And lucky for me, I wake up with her every single morning. <br /><br /><i>Jonathan Small is a writer in Los Angeles. He lost the Duran Duran haircut after his wife threatened divorce.</i><br /><br /><b>Worst Love</b><br /><br /><b>Orange Crush</b><br />Does having a mission make unrequited love any easier to take?<br /><br />By Steve Almond<br /><br />Why did I fall so hard for Nancy Dodd?<br /><br />Was it her curly black hair, her cupidinous dancer booty, the sweetly embarrassed tilt of her smile? <br /><br />No. Young Ms. Dodd won me over with something even more irresistible: her total indifference to me as a suitor.<br /><br />I wooed her with the fierce incompetence only a sophomore in college can muster. This meant slices of pepperoni pizza delivered, unsolicited, to her room (how was I supposed to know she was a vegetarian?); long, disingenuous talks about my devout feminism; nakedly ulterior offers to drive her to the local Waldbaum's in my Mercury Bobcat. <br /><br />Five months of pursuit ended in the laundry room beneath our dorm. I had timed my spin cycle to coincide with hers, based on a pattern of surveillance that would not technically qualify as stalking. It was more like skulking. We were alone amid the orphaned socks and lint traps. I leaned in for a kiss. Nancy turned and all I?got was cheek.<br /><br />She said, quietly, excruciatingly, she didn't like me like that.<br /><br />""Like what?"" I said, ridiculously.<br /><br />I felt like I'd been punched in the gut. It wasn't just the sting of rejection, but the embarrassment of realizing I'd never really had a shot. I'd only convinced myself I did. This is all by way of noting what should be obvious to anyone with a functioning heart: The <00AD>unrequited crush is the worst kind of love you can harbor. I should know. I've been pursuing women who don't like me like that for most of my life. <br /><br />At Camp Tawonga, it was a champion swimmer named Susie who spent time with me - as I eventually discovered - in the hopes that I would introduce her to my older brother. Years later, in grad school, it was a tall, brassy curator who invited me to her garden party, where I gazed into her eyes for a good half hour, until her lesbian lover came over and began kissing her neck.<br /><br />I don't know why I've always been so susceptible to these crushes. It may have something to do with giving myself a defined mission. Getting the girl becomes a shortcut to self-esteem. It's also a welcome distraction from my darker demons, the self-doubt and professional insecurity that I wear most days like a crown of thorns. None of this should come as a particular shock to anyone. Men have been finding a way to blame their misery on women for years. Just listen to any blues recording. <br /><br />This has been true of me since my very first crush: Shelly from Israel. I spent most of fourth grade following her around making bad knock-knock jokes to get her attention. On the last day of the school year, the teacher told us that Shelly had an announcement to make.<br /><br />""I'm moving back to Israel!"" she sang out.<br /><br />While the rest of the class pelted her with questions (""Do they have Ninja Turtles in Israel?"") I retreated to the corner and tried not to weep over my graham crackers and milk. I give Shelly credit, though. She did try to?comfort me.<br /><br />""Hey, Jokeman"" - she called me Jokeman - ""I have a joke for you: Knock knock!""<br /><br />""Who's there?"" I mumbled.<br /><br />""Orange,"" she said, in her adorable accent.<br /><br />""Orange who?""<br /><br />""Orange crush,"" she said. ""Get it?""<br /><br />""Yeah,"" I whispered, dejected. ""Got it."" <br /><br /><i>Steve Almond's upcoming essay collection</i> Not That You Asked, <i>will be out in fall 2007.

She was almost 29. I didn't think much of our age difference, because within weeks I knew I'd met the smartest-sexiest-wittiest woman in the English-speaking world. She's a great dancer from swing to samba, a fair hand at car repair, and a former cardiac care nurse with a Ph.D. in English. Not exactly someone you'd get bored with over the course ofa lifetime. <br /><br />We married 2 years later. When I look back, I marvel at all the movies in which 20-something men fear the consequences of being ""tied down."" Sure, it's possible that one of you might be attracted to someone else. But that's hardly the only challenge married couples face.<br /><br />As it happens, we've faced plenty over 21 years. Our first child had severe asthma as a toddler and was repeatedly hospitalized; one admitting physician thought we'd lose him. We didn't, but a few years later our second child was born with Down syndrome. We've dealt with emotional breakdowns, career crises, and stupefying heartbreaks. Yet through it all, we've managed to love each other for the difficult, fragile, opinionated people we are.<br /><br />You know that point in a relationship when you think every little thing the other person does is magic? Well, as Sting himself found out, that point doesn't last forever. It's eventually overtaken - not by emergencies and heartbreak but by all the mundane aspects of living under the same roof. Janet does many magical things, but she also flings water all over the kitchen when she's washing lettuce, leaves half-full cups and glasses around the house, and has a strange enthusiasm for both Joni Mitchell and crooning show tunes. Me, I never make the bed, I can't remember our children's clothing sizes, I stay up late, and I like to sleep in. Last but not least, Janet has moderate hearing loss in one ear; I talk fast and mumble. This is not a match made in heaven. It is merely a very good match made on earth.<br /><br />Love over 20-plus years doesn't always get deeper and more firmly rooted. What's really amazing about lasting love is that it gets more complex. Once we simply walked arm in arm through the world. Now our minds are better together than apart; our bodies heartily agree. And after all this time, I can't think of any other body I'd rather be tied down to. <br /><br /><i>Michael Bérubé is the Paterno Family Professor in Literature at Penn State University and author of</i> Life As We KnowIt: A Father, a Family, and an Exceptional Child.<br />",Decode Him
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/sedentary-lifestyle-hazards,Health,4,10,2,119,9,70,26,0,,How a Sedentary Lifestyle (Sitting Too Much Every Day) Can Seriously Endanger Your Health,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0911-bodys-biggest.jpg,"<p>You might not want to take the following stat sitting down: According to a poll of nearly 6,300 people by the Institute for Medicine and Public Health, it's likely that you spend a stunning 56 hours a week planted like a geranium-staring at your computer screen, working the steering wheel, or collapsed in a heap in front of your high-def TV. And it turns out women may be more <a target=""_self"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/how-do-you-stay-slim-at-an-office-job"">sedentary</a> than men, since they tend to play fewer sports and hold less active jobs.<br /><br />Even if you think you are energetic, sitting all day at work is common for most of us. And it's killing us-literally-by way of obesity, <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/what-you-should-know-about-your-heart"">heart disease</a>, and diabetes. All this downtime is so unhealthy that it's given birth to a new area of medical study called inactivity physiology, which explores the effects of our increasingly butt-bound, tech-driven lives, as well as a deadly new epidemic researchers have dubbed ""sitting disease.""<br /><br /><br /><b>The Modern-Day Desk Sentence</b><br />""Our bodies have evolved over millions of years to do one thing: move,"" says James Levine,M.D., Ph.D., of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and author of <i>Move a Little, Lose a Lot</i>. ""As human beings, we evolved to stand upright. For thousands of generations, our environment demanded nearly <a target=""_self"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/why-norwegians-are-thin"">constant physical activity</a>.""<br /><br />But thanks to technological advances, the Internet, and an increasingly longer work week, that environment has disappeared. ""Electronic living has all but sapped every flicker of activity from our daily lives,"" Levine says. You can shop, pay bills, make a living, and with Twitter and Facebook, even catch up with friends without so much as standing up. And the consequences of all that easy living are profound.<br /><br />When you sit for an extended period of time, your body starts to shut down at the metabolic level, says Marc Hamilton, Ph.D., associate professor of biomedical sciences at the University of Missouri. When muscles-especially the big ones meant for movement, like those in your legs-are immobile, your circulation slows and you burn fewer calories. Key flab-burning enzymes responsible for breaking down triglycerides (a type of fat) simply start switching off. Sit for a full day and those fat burners plummet by 50 percent, Levine says.<br /><br />That's not all. The less you move, the less blood sugar your body uses; research shows that for every two hours spent on your backside per day, your chance of contracting diabetes goes up by 7 percent. Your risk for heart disease goes up, too, because enzymes that keep blood fats in check are inactive. You're also more prone to depression: With less blood flow, fewer feel-good hormones are circulating to your brain.<br /><br />Sitting too much is also hell on your <a target=""_self"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/yoga/yoga-for-better-posture"">posture</a> and <a target=""_self"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/yoga/yoga-for-better-posture"">spine health</a>, says Douglas Lentz, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and the director of fitness and wellness for Summit Health in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. ""When you sit all day, your hip flexors and hamstrings shorten and tighten, while the muscles that support your spine become weak and stiff,"" he says. It's no wonder that the incidence of chronic lower-back pain among women has increased threefold since the early 1990s.<br /><br />And even if you exercise, you're not immune. Consider this: We've become so <a target=""_self"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-success-story-14"">sedentary</a> that 30 minutes a day at the gym may not do enough to counteract the detrimental effects of eight, nine, or 10 hours of sitting, says Genevieve Healy, Ph.D., a research fellow at the Cancer Prevention Research Centre of the University of Queensland in Australia. That's one big reason so many women still struggle with weight, blood sugar, and cholesterol woes despite keeping consistent workout routines.<br /><br />In a recent study, Healy and her colleagues found that regardless of how much moderate to vigorous exercise participants did, those who took more breaks from sitting throughout the day had slimmer waists, lower BMIs (body mass indexes), and healthier blood fat and blood sugar levels than those who sat the most. In an extensive study of 17,000 people, Canadian researchers drew an even more succinct conclusion: The longer you spend sitting each day, the more likely you are to die an early death-no matter how fit you are.<br /><br /><b>The Non-Exercise Answer</b><br />So if exercise alone isn't the solution, what is? Fortunately, it's easier than you think to ward off the perils of prolonged parking. Just ramp up your daily non-exercise activity thermogenesis-or NEAT. That's the energy (i.e., calories) you burn doing everything but exercise. It's having sex, folding laundry, tapping your toes, and simply standing up. And it can be the difference between wearing a sarong or flaunting your bikini on your next beach vacation.<br /><br />In his groundbreaking study on NEAT, the Mayo Clinic's Levine used motion-sensing underwear (hot, huh?) to track every single step and fidget of 20 people who weren't regular exercisers (half of them were obese; half were not). After 10 days, he found that the lean participants moved an average of 150 minutes more per day than the overweight people did-enough to burn 350 calories, or about one cheeseburger.<br /><br />Fidgeting, standing, and puttering may even keep you off medications and out of the doctor's office. Think of your body as a computer: As long as you're moving the mouse and tapping the keys, all systems are go. But let it idle for a few minutes, and the machine goes into power-conservation mode. Your body is meant to be active, so when you sit and do nothing for too long, it shuts down and burns less energy. Getting consistent activity throughout the day keeps your metabolism humming along in high gear.<br /><br />When you get out of your chair and start moving around, you turn on fat burners. Simply standing up fries three times as many calories as sitting on your butt, according to Levine. And, he adds, ""NEAT activity can improve blood flow and increase the amount of serotonin available to the brain, so that your thinking becomes sharper and you'll be less likely to feel depressed.""<br /><br /><b>Get Your Move On</b><br />Shake things up throughout the day by interrupting your sedentary stints as often as possible. ""Stand up every half hour,"" says Neville Owen, Ph.D., of the University of Queensland. ""If you have to sit for longer than that, take more extended and active breaks and move around for a few minutes before sitting back down.""<br /><br />When you're reading e-mail and taking phone calls, do it standing. Walk with colleagues to brainstorm ideas. And consider trading your chair for a large stability ball. ""It forces you to engage your muscles, and you're likely to stand up more because you're not melting into a chair,"" Lentz says.<br /><br />At home, it's simple: Limit TV time to two hours a day or less. Better yet, watch it from a treadmill or exercise bike. Among women, the risk for metabolic syndrome-a constellation of health woes including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar-shoots up 26 percent for every hour per day they spend watching the tube.<br /><br />Not sure how much of a difference these mini moves will make? Check out the chart below. Swapping a more active approach for just a few of your daily activities can help stave off the one-to two-pound weight gain most women accumulate every year-and it can keep your metabolism buzzing the way nature intended it to.<br /><br /><b>Instead of This: </b><br />Sitting at your desk<br />83 Calories burned per hour<br /><b>Do This:</b><br />Stand at your desk<br />115 Calories burned per hour<br /><br /><b>Instead of This:</b><br />Riding the elevator<br />128<br /><b>Do This:</b><br />Take the stairs<br />509<br /><br /><b>Instead of This:</b><br />Shopping online<br />96<br /><b>Do This:</b><br />Shop at the mall<br />(walking briskly and carrying packages)<br />147<br /><br /><b>Instead of This:</b><br />Calling for takeout<br />96<br /><b>Do This:</b><br />Cook at home<br />128<br /><br /><b>Instead of This:</b><br />Talking on the phone seated<br />102<br /><b>Do This:</b><br />Pace while chatting<br />147<br /><br /><b>Instead of This:</b><br />E-mailing a coworker<br />96<br /><b>Do This:</b><br />Walk to her office<br />128<br /><br /><b>Instead of This:</b><br />Watching TV<br />64<br /><b>Do This:</b><br />Make out<br />96<br /><br /><b>Instead of This:</b><br />Playing a seated video game<br />32<br /><b>Do This:</b><br />Play Wii<br />178<br /><br /><b>Total calories:</b><br />697 vs. 1,448*<br />*based on a 140-pound woman<br /> </p>",Gear

Slipping back into a fitness routine after a break can be daunting, especially when youconsider that such breaks can cause you to lose up to 50percent of your lean muscle mass and cardiovascular strength. ""As soon as you stop participating in regular activity, your body starts detraining,"" says Lynn Millar, Ph.D., a professor of physical therapy at Andrews University in Michigan. ""But if you were fairly fit before the break, you'll bounce back quickly, because your muscular patterns were more deeply etched."" Whether you've been planted on your butt for 2 weeks or 2 years, <i>WH</i> has tips to help you ease it and the rest ofyour body up off the couch and back into your routine.<br /><br /><b>Your Break: 2 Weeks</b><p></p><p><b>Loss of muscle strength:</b> up to 12 percent<br /><b>Loss of aerobic endurance:</b> 7 percent<br /><b>Comeback time:</b> 1 week<br /><br /></p><li> <b>What Happened</b><br />Luckily, not too much. Your loss of muscular strength means that you can probably still do your standard sets ofbiceps curls, but you'll feel the burn earlier in your repetitions, says New York City athletic trainer Gene Schafer. Your ticker's a bit slower, too. ""You've lost some of your endurance because your heart has not been stimulated to be efficient,"" says Mary Mundrane-Zweiacher, an athletic trainer in Dover, Delaware. ""So if you were running 5 miles a day before the break, you might now get winded at the 4-mile mark instead of the end."" <br /><br /></li><li> <b>Get It Back </b><br />You haven't lost much in terms of your fitness level, so you just need to step back and make a few small tweaks to your routine to get back ontrack. Here's how:<br /><br /><b>Hit pause</b> Allow for 10 extra seconds to recover between sets. ""This will allow your heart rate, which isn't quite at its normal level, to lower enough to give you a better next set, with better technique,"" Schafer says. ""So you'll be able to complete your routine and see results faster."" <br /><br /><b>Focus on power muscles</b> After a 2-week break, your glutes and quads are still strong enough to tackle tough exercise, Mundrane-Zweiacher says. ""Squats, lunges, and stepups will set muscle fibers firing and rebuilding fast - without risking injury,"" she says. Working such a large muscle group will also get you back into a high calorie-burning mode. Run up a flight of steps (the longer the better) and at the top, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and squat until your knees reach 90 degrees. Do three reps and then walk back down the stairs. Do three sets of stairs and squats for the first 3 days of your return to exercise. <br /><br /><b>Go free</b> Since you've lost some muscle but still have enough strength to stabilize what you have, use free weights instead of machines to work more muscle groups at once, Schafer says. If you feel a little flabby (your muscles might not be as tight now as they were before), do some extra sets of light, high-rep toning exercises for your arms and thighs: Holding a 5-pound dumbbell in each hand, with palms down, slowly raise your arms until they're parallel with the floor. Dothree sets of 15 reps. For your thighs, do three sets of 15 lunges with a 5-pound dumbbell in each hand. <br /><br /><b>Do music intervals</b> Intervals will crank up your rate of return by requiring your body to adapt to different speeds, explains Laura Keller, a physical therapist with the Stone Clinic in San Francisco. ""You'll probably be returning at a slightly lower level of speed and endurance due to the 2-week break, and intervals help your heart retrain faster than running at one steady pace,"" says Jim Rutberg of Carmichael Training Systems in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Use your MP3 player for music tempos: After a 10-minute warmup jog, run fast for one song and at a slower pace for the next one. Continue this for at least five songs, or listen to aradio station for 30 to 60 minutes, running at a medium pace during songs and alternating sprinting and walking through commercials.<br /><br /><b>Your Break: 2 Months</b><p></p></li><p><b>Loss of muscle strength:</b> 35 percentLoss of aerobic endurance: 18 percent<br /><b>Comeback time:</b> 6 weeks <br /><br /></p><li> <b>What Happened</b> <br />The extra project you took on led not only to stress acne and late-night Chow Ming dinners, but also to a significant loss of your fitness base. ""Your muscles haven't been fatigued lately, so your first workout back may actually feel pretty good, but then your performance is going to go downhill fast,"" Rutberg says. ""Plus, you've lost a considerable amount of your range of motion, so even doing a simple biceps curl can put you at risk for injury."" And after 2 months off of cardiovascular workouts, getting back on the elliptical trainer for 45 minutes is going to feel like climbing the Statue of Liberty. ""Your lungs are not as efficient at pumping oxygen to your blood, and your heart is not as efficient at pumping blood to your muscles,"" says Ann Trombley, an Olympic mountain biker and physical therapist in Boulder, Colorado. ""Therefore your fuel supply - oxygen - is low. It's like running out of gas in your car; you're going to chug and sputter."" <br /><br /></li><li> <b>Get It Back </b><br />You'll need to cut back on your old intensity and slowly build your fitness over the 6-week period, which is actually the length of a solid strength-building cycle. Modifying both your cardio and strength exercises will help you gradually ramp your routine up to where it was before you stopped working out. Schedule at least three workouts each week, and revise your old plan like this:<br /><br /><b>Play quarters</b> And we don't mean at the local frat house. Do one-fourth the cardio you were doing before the break, which will help prevent overexertion yet still ease you back into shape, Keller says. ""If you were previously cycling for 2 hours, ride for 30 to 45 minutes, three times a week, and increase by 15 minutes each week,"" she says. If you were jogging for 1 hour on the treadmill, cut your session back to 15 minutes, adding more minutes each week. <br /><br /><b>Push up your strength</b> Because your pectoral and arm muscles are weaker, you're at much greater risk for injuring them if you drop and give us military-style pushups, Mundrane-Zweiacher says. On your first day back, do as many modified pushups (with your knees on the floor) as you can. Do them three times a week, and when you can do 30, switch to military style. If you can't do 30, finish the set with modified pushups. This move builds muscle quickly in a safer way than the classic and uses nothing but your body weight; you're less likely to injure yourself doing a pushup than trying to maneuver weights.<br /> <br /><b>Get with the band</b> You're more likely to be sloppy and hurt yourself if you use free weights right away, Schafer says. ""Resistance bands will help you quickly regain the strength you've lost without causing an injury, because they keep you in place much like machines do. But the resistance depends on how hard you pull, so they're gentler."" Work both your upper and lower body with the bent-leg deadlift band curl in ""Priceless Strength"" (page 73), or do skier pulls: Shut the band into a door and step back until it just starts to pull. Squat facing the door, and as you lower your body, pull the band to your sides and behind you. <br /> <br /><b>Be partial</b> The muscles on the insides of your knees might be weaker than the ones on the outsides, because your IT bands (the tendons on the outsides of your thighs) tighten with inactivity. As a result, you start using your muscles differently, according to Mundrane-Zweiacher. That puts you at risk for knee problems, and jumping back into regular squats could make that risk higher. For the first 2 weeks, do partial squats by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and bending your knees to 45 degrees. <br /><br /><b>Your Break: 2 Years</b><p></p><p><b>Loss of muscle strength:</b> Up to 50 percent<br /><b>Loss of aerobic endurance:</b> Up to 50 percent<br /><b>Comeback Time:</b> 12 weeks <br /><br /></p></li><li> <b>What Happened</b> <br />Seriously. What happened? Unfortunately, you could be half the woman you used to be, even if your jeans size has doubled. ""After a 2-year hiatus from weight training, lifting a 10-pound dumbbell is going to feel like lifting a 30-pound one because your muscle fibers have shrunk,"" Trombley says. Your body will feel softer, and your butt could feel sore after climbing the two flights to your apartment.<br /> <br /></li><li> <b>Get It Back </b><br />Considering you flexed your intelligence more than your muscles for 2 years (well, let's hope so), a 3-month retraining period really isn't that bad. Pamela Peeke, M.D., author of Body for Life for Women, recommends building onto your routine in a pyramid format to avoid overstressing yourself too quickly. For example, in strength training, start with a set of 15 reps. Add 2 pounds for the next set and cut it back to 12 reps. To ease into your cardio routine, crank the resistance on a bike up a level each week. One warning: If after a few weeks you feel like you've been hit by a bus, don't sweat it. ""You might feel exhausted, because your body's not used to building new muscle,"" Dr. Millar says. ""But your energy level will improve after about a month."" <br /><br /><b>Psych up</b> It might be harder to stick with your routine now, since it's essentially brand new again. California sport psychologist Jim Taylor suggests hiring help. Personal trainers boost motivation, according to studies by the American Council on Exercise. Shell out for several sessions in advance, so if you skip your workout, you'll feel not only an extra inch on your waistline - but a pinch on your wallet.<br /><br /><b>Go hard core</b> Your core is the center of your fitness universe, and at this point you'll need to rebuild it. Try Mundrane-Zweiacher's 90-90 holds. Lie on your back with your spine in a neutral (neither arched nor rounded) position, with your abs pulled tight. Next, lift your feet so that your knees and hips are both at a sharp 90 degrees. On day one, hold it for 10 seconds, then add 10 seconds each day until you reach 2 minutes. <br /><br /><b>Walk away</b> You're more prone to shin splints and a sore back because of possible muscle imbalances, and walking is one of the gentlest ways to work those muscles evenly while easing your cardiovascular system back into shape, Keller says. Plus, a recent University of Texas at Austin study showed that walking for just 30 minutes relieves depression, providing the same pick-me-up some people seek in Krispy Kremes. Keller suggests doing 2-mile walks three times a week for 3 to 4 weeks. After a month of walking, alternate between walking and running for another month, which will help your body adjust more slowly to the demands of running. After 6 weeks of total exercise, start adding mileage toyour runs and picking up the pace.<br /><br /></li>",Getting Started

But in this age of endless ingredients and menus the size of small novels, ordering the Dieters DeLite every time defies the whole point of going to a restaurant. The good news: You have more healthy<a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/experts/eating-out""> eating out options</a> than you think.<br /><br /><b>Sushi</b><br /><br /><b>Good:</b> Spicy Tuna Roll <br />The mayonnaise adds a bit more fat and calories, but, like salmon, tuna contains omega-3s, tryptophan (which helps regulate moods), and selenium (which protects cells from free-radical damage). The spicy chili pepper may reduce cholesterol. ""As if that's not enough, the seaweed used in the roll provides a broad range of minerals,"" says Lisa Margolin, a holistic nutritionist and coauthor of Viva's Healthy Dining Guide.<br /><br /><b>Better:</b> Salmon Avocado Roll <br />All the goodness of salmon and seaweed mentioned above, plus avocado. Packed with heart-healthy folate, this green giant may also help regulate blood pressure and fight cancer.<br /><br /><b>Best:</b> California Roll and Assorted Sashimi <br />""Ask for real crab to make sure you're getting your <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/healthy-fat-without-fish"">omega-3 fatty acids</a>, magnesium, folate, selenium, and B6 in addition to the avocado and seaweed,"" Margolin says. California rolls tend to run small, and sashimi is rice-free, which means lots of nutrients for remarkably few calories.<br /><br /><b>Worst:</b> Shrimp Tempura Roll <br />About as fattening as sushi gets. <br /><br /><b>Tex-Mex</b><br /><br /><b>Good:</b> Fish Tacos <br />The corn tortillas are just a little bit of sin, absolved by the fish within. ""The omega-3 fats are great for your skin and hair and have been found to reduce the risk of heart disease,"" says Roberta Larson Duyff, R.D., author of the American Dietetic Association Complete Food and Nutrition Guide. ""Oily fish like tuna and mackerel also deliver vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus - all important to healthy bones.""<br /><br /><b>Better:</b> Fajitas <br />Basically a Mexican stir-fry on a tortilla, fajitas can be as healthy as you make them. ""Avocado provides healthy fats, so opt for guacamole instead of sour cream,"" Margolin says. Pile on the vegetables and top with just a sprinkle of cheese.<br /><br /><b>Best:</b> Fish or Shrimp Veracruz <br />Seafood cooked in the Veracruz style is usually grilled, baked, or braised with chopped tomatoes, onions, garlic, chiles, olives, lime, cinnamon, clove, and bay leaves. Garlic boosts immunity, and the antioxidants in tomatoes and cinnamon may help lower bad cholesterol.<br /><br /><b>Worst:</b> The Chimichanga (aka Deep-Fried Burrito) <br />Naturally - but beware its unfried cousin, too. Even if it's filled with innocent stuff like black beans and tomatoes, a football-size burrito still takes a caloric toll.<br /><br /><b>Indian</b><br /><br /><b>Good:</b> Chicken Tikka Masala <br />Cream aside, the sauce features a long list of herbs and spices with benefits ranging from stomach-soothing ginger to cholesterol-lowering coriander. If you're watching your weight, Margolin advises you pluck the chicken out of the sauce instead of pouring the whole thing onto your pile of rice.<br /><br /><b>Better:</b> Palak Dal <br />A combo of stewed lentils and spinach, this entrée is made with yogurt, not cream. Lentils are high in fiber as well as heart-friendly folate and magnesium. Spinach has been shown to help prevent cancer and is packed with bone-maintaining vitamin K.<br /><br /><b>Best:</b> Tandoori Fish or Chicken <br />Meat or fish cooked in a tandor oven is seasoned with spices, not fat, says Joanne Lichten, Ph.D., R.D., author of Dining Lean: How to Eat Healthy in Your Favorite Restaurants. Complement your low-calorie protein with a few spoonfuls of curried lentils (ask for curry made with yogurt, not cream or coconut milk).<br /><br /><b>Worst:</b> Lamb Curry with Nuts and Coconut Milk <br />The lamb is fine, but coconut milk packs 500 calories a cup. Combine that with nuts and the ghee (melted butter) also used in most recipes and this is over the top.<br /><br /><b><br />Italian</b><br /><br /><b>Good:</b> Linguine alla Marinara <br />Classic pasta is a hit with nutritionists now that scientists have discovered that thelycopene in tomatoes is an antioxidant and major cancer fighter. ""Marinara sauce also has half the calories of alfredo or carbonara,"" Dr. Lichten says. Garlic will help kick your cold, and olive oil provides vitamin E.<br /><br /><b>Better:</b> Capellini Pomodoro <br />Pomodoro sauce boasts garlic, olive oil, high-fiber chickpeas, and basil, which contains flavonoids that help maintain cellular structure. Plus, ""Capellini is lighter than other pastas,"" Margolin says.<br /><br /><b>Best:</b> Pasta with Fruiti del Mar <br />A feast you can feel good about. ""Because it's usually brimming with clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp, and squid, you're less likely to overeat,"" Margolin says. This bevy of seafood serves up omega-3s, B vitamins, magnesium, and potassium - all of which contribute to cardiovascular health.<br /><br /><b>Worst:</b> Fettuccine Alfredo <br />The sauce alone has up 38 grams of fat in a 1/2 cup serving. Enough said.<br /><br /><b>Thai</b><br /><br /><b>Good:</b> Shrimp Pad Thai<br /><br /><b>Good news:</b> Peanut oil is delicious and nutritionally sound. ""It has a mono-unsaturated fat content similar to olive oil, so it's healthy,"" Duyff says. Still, leave a few high-calorie peanuts on the dish when you're done. <br /><br /><b>Better:</b> Pad See Ew<br />The ultimate comfort lunch, pad see ew combines thick, flat rice noodles and heaps of Chinese broccoli with egg, garlic, soy sauce, and a little sugar. Broccoli is a wonder vegetable that has been shown to ward off cancer, heart disease, ulcers, and cataracts while providing calcium. <br /><br /><b>Best:</b> Pad Kra Prow<br />This spicy stir-fry has chile peppers, mushrooms, onion, and garlic saut? with fresh basil leaves. Chiles are anti-inflammatory cholesterol fighters; garlic and mushrooms strengthen your immune system; and basil helps maintain cells. <br /><br /><b>Worst:</b> Masaman Curry<br />With coconut milk, potatoes, and peanuts over white rice, this dish combines one too many high-calorie ingredients - and it's so <b>Good:</b>, it's tough to eat just a little. <br /><br /><b>Chinese </b><br /><br /><b>Good:</b> Chicken and Cashews<br />Ideal if you're this close to ordering something fried and syrupy. ""The protein in the chicken will fill you up, and the cashews will satisfy your craving for comfort food without the excess oil or sugar,"" Duyff says. <br /><br /><b>Better:</b> Shrimp and Broccoli <br />A simple stir-fry isn't likely to have a lot of sauce, which means minimal fat. ""Cancer-fighting broccoli is a great source of vitamins C and A as well as folate and fiber,"" Margolin says, while shrimp has less fat and fewer calories than chicken or beef.<br /><br /><b>Best:</b> Buddha's Delight<br />Bean curd, rich in calcium and fiber, is accompanied by an array of vitamin- and mineral-packed vegetables and herbs, including bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, sprouts, snow peas, ginger, carrots, and mushrooms. Bonus ingredients: gingko nuts, which may improve memory and boost nervous system functioning. <br /><br /><b>Worst:</b> General Tsao's Chicken<br />Chicken chunks are rolled in egg and cornstarch, then deep fried in oil and drowned in a sugary sauce. Delicious but deadly.<br /><br /><b>Brunch </b><br /><br />Your Sunday morning social meal doesn't have to be a calorie fest<br /><br /><b>Good:</b>: Buckwheat Pancakes with Real Maple Syrup<br />Whole-grain buckwheat is one of the healthiest pancake choices, while syrup is a good source of energy-boosting zinc and manganese.<br /><br /><b>Better:</b>: Hot Oatmeal with Fresh Fruit, Walnuts, and a Jolt of Condensed Milk<br />Oatmeal is fiber fabulous, fruits will provide vitamins and antioxidants, walnuts supply almost all your daily omega-3 fatty acids, and a little condensed milk won't kill you.<br /><br /><b>Best:</b>: Feta and Spinach Omelet with Onions<br />This satisfying omelet, packed with nutrient-rich spinach, won't leave you feeling weighed down. ""Feta is so full-flavored that just a little goes a long way,"" Margolin says.<br /><br /><b>Worst:</b> Buttermilk Pancakes with Faux Syrup, Butter, and a Side of Bacon<br />Simple carbs, sugar, fat, and salt do your body no service.<br />",healthy eating

Now it's the status quo. According to the U.S. Census, nearly 5 million unmarried couples wake up together every day. As for everyone else, the majority of husbands and wives had the same address before walking down the aisle. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that more than half of women have lived with a significant other at some point by age 30. When you're in love, it makes perfect sense - you save money by splitting the bills, your favorite person is around to talk to every night, and best of all, there's <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/mens-sex-secrets"">sex</a> on tap.<br /><br />But people rarely talk about how surprisingly stressful living together can be. ""It's about more than sharing a bed,"" says Marshall Miller, coauthor of <i>Unmarried to Each Other</i>. ""It's about making intricate, complicated decisions about money, housework, and time."" To keep your love thriving under the extra pressure, take these six realities of cohabitation into consideration.<br /><br /><b>Reality #1 It doesn't seal the deal.</b><br /><br />Moving in seems like a natural precursor to marriage, but you shouldn't count on it. In fact, only 45 percent of couples who <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/living-together-tips"">cohabitate</a> get hitched, says Susan Brown, Ph.D., a sociologist at Bowling Green State University. And research has linked living together before tying the knot to an increased risk of unhappy marriage. One theory as to why: People who live together often swap rings not because they're right for each other, but because they feel too invested in the relationship to break up, says Paul Amato, Ph.D., a sociologist at Penn State University.<br /><br /><b>Strategy #1 Talk about the future.</b><br />If marriage is what you want, make that crystal clear even if - scratch that, especially if - it requires an <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/communication-advice"">uncomfortable conversation</a>. A recent study in the <i>Journal of Family Psychology</i> found that couples who get engaged before setting up house are happier pre and postmarriage than couples who do so after the move. ""Make sure you understand each other's reasons for wanting to move in,"" advises study author Galena Kline, a research associate at the University of Denver Center for Marital and Family Studies. Even if you don't go shopping for a diamond, agree on a timeline for how the relationship is going to unfold.<br /><br /><b>Reality #2 All roommates are irritating.</b><br /><br />Just because you're hot for each other doesn't make living together easy. Annie Sargent, 34, a lawyer in Seattle, says she's frequently been on edge since her boyfriend moved in a year ago. When he washes dishes, ""he's a whirling dervish - soapy water gets all over everything,"" Sargent says. She gets so annoyed she yells at him, and then he gets upset because he was trying to help. And that's just one example. ""I want him there,"" she says. ""But now I'm irritated all the time.""<br /><br /><b>Strategy #2 Choose your battles.</b><br />Yes, he's annoying. But he'll always be annoying! And so will you by virtue of sharing the same space 24/7. ""You need to let go of the little things that bug you but aren't meaningful,"" says Noelle Nelson, Ph.D., psychologist and author of <i>The Power of Appreciation</i>. Easier said than done, so try this: Whenever he's driving you up the wall, try to think of three nice things he's done for you lately. It should defuse your irritation just enough to keep you from lashing out.<br /><br /><b>Reality #3 It's not just about you anymore.</b><br /><br />You want to grab a drink with an ex after work. Or apply for that amazing job in Newfoundland. But now your decisions, from trivial to momentous, will affect another person's routine, lifestyle, and bank account. ""Everything I did suddenly involved an extra step,"" says Bill Schmidt, 36, who moved in with his girlfriend 8 years ago. Formerly speedy grocery runs now required remembering what kind of yogurt, or cookies, or bread she liked. ""It took a while to adjust to not just thinking about myself.""<br /><br /><b>Strategy #3 Be a better half.</b><br />As corny as it sounds, moving in together really does mean becoming a team, and that means giving up a lot of the autonomy you've been reveling in since you were 18. Before making decisions that could affect him, ask yourself how you would feel if he did the same to you. Then proceed accordingly even if it makes you groan. ""If you don't do that, you won't stay together, or you'll stay together and be miserable,"" says John Jacobs, M.D., a psychiatrist and author of <i>All You Need Is Love and Other Lies About Marriage</i>.<br /><br /><b>Reality #4 Love doesn't solve money problems.</b><br /><br />You might be saving a bundle on rent - unless, of course, you moved into a bigger, more expensive place together. But money problems are as inevitable as basement drafts and broken toilet-bowl handles. According to an April 2006 Money magazine survey, 70 percent of couples admit to arguing about finances. ""Money is so entwined with power and control, it's seldom something you can talk about objectively with your significant other,"" says Deborah Knuckey, author of <i>Conscious Spending for Couples</i>.<br /><br /><b>Strategy #4 Decide now how you're going to handle financial stuff.</b><br />Don't wait until the bills start clogging your mailbox. Some ideas: If one of you earns more than the other, that person should contribute proportionately to the bills. A lot of couples divvy up money chores pretty traditionally: He handles investments, she takes care of bills and daily expenses. ""But there's no right or wrong - people decide these things very differently,"" Knuckey says. Come up with a plan and put it in writing: If arguments arise later, it'll help clear up any fuzzy memories.<br /><br /><b>Reality #5 The sex will change.</b><br /><br />According to the 1997 Durex Global Sex Survey, people who live together but aren't married report the greatest frequency of sex. So that's a plus. The minus? The sex can lose its wow factor. A 2004 ABC News poll found that 58 percent of people who are married or have lived together for less than 3 years report ""very exciting"" sex lives, compared with 29 percent of couples who've been at it more than 10 years.<br /><br /><b>Strategy #5 Keep searching for new triggers.</b><br />A new body in bed might be a bigger source of excitement, but when it comes to truly satisfying, orgasmic sex, nothing beats knowing each other well, says Susan Heitler, Ph.D., a Denver marriage therapist and author of <i>The Power of Two</i>. Take pleasure in the fact that he knows exactly where and how to rub. Just don't assume there's nothing left for each of you to learn. ""Keep trying different kinds of touching, different times to fool around, different ways to turn each other on,"" Dr. Heitler says. Use what you already know to find out more - if he likes your tongue in his ear, he'd probably love it on his upper thigh.<br /><br /><b>Reality #6 Expect the unexpected.</b><br /><br />When Melissa Haroza, 36, and her boyfriend, Chris, shacked up 3 years ago, she had a cat, but Chris was against pets. ""Then one day before a vacation he said he was worried about the cat,"" says Haroza, who married Chris last year. ""He thought she'd get lonely and suggested taking her with us."" And it wasn't because he wanted to toss her out of the plane. He'd actually started to care about the kitty. Never underestimate the power of a solid relationship to bring out surprising new sides of a person.<br /><br /><b>Strategy #6 Stay the course.</b><br />If the basics are there - trust, shared values, good communication - don't give up when you hit a rough spot (and you will). To keep the going as smooth as possible, build a support system of friends and family members who you can count on as a couple, Dr. Nelson says. As for major brawls, sometimes just letting time pass can give each of you a chance to sort out your feelings. That's one of the great things about moving in together - you can go to bed mad, and, chances are, you'll still wake up happy to see each other.<br />",relationships

I'd only brought products for a normal touch-up. So I tried clarifying shampoo, and when that didn't work, I used dish soap, but the green still didn't completely come out.

But it's something worth thinking about: Not only does it make you look taller and slimmer, but it also aids digestion and helps you <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/have-more-energy-for-a-better-work-out"">get more energy</a>. ""When you slouch you get less oxygen to your muscles and impair blood flow to your gut, causing indigestion. You also get headaches from cramped neck muscles and look lousy,"" says Drew DeMann, Ph.D., of Manhattan Spine and Sports Therapy. </p><p></p>Incorporate these posture-enhancing exercises into your fitness routine - and straighten yourself out.<p></p>Exercise   <br /><br />Seated Stability Ball Row<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0603_seated_sball_row.jpg"" /><br /><br /><b>Posture payback:</b> It strengthens your upper back and shoulders to keep them from rounding forward. ""This can improve your breathing and increase energy,"" Dr. DeMann says.<br /><br />Sit on a stability ball with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and your neck in line with your back. Grip a 5-pound dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing each other and your elbows bent at 90-degree angles. Row the weights to your sides, squeezing your shoulder blades together. 3Exercise   <br /><br />Spinal Stretch<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0603_spinal_stretch.jpg"" /><br /><br /><b>Posture payback:</b> It will help elongate your spine. ""Your head weighs the same as a small TV set,"" says Richard Brennan, author of five books on the Alexander Technique, which is a gentle, dance-inspired method known for enhancing posture. By relieving your spine of that compression, he says, you can stand half of an inch taller.<br /><br />Lie on a mat with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Support your head with a small pillow and, with your eyes open, let your body sink into the mat as you focus on lengthening your spine. Think of your pelvis releasing away from your head. Allow yourself to breathe deeply and continue for 20 minutes. ""You won't notice much at first, but after a few weeks, you'll have better posture,"" Brennan says. But don't confuse this exercise with sleep. ""It's different because you're lying still, consciously releasing your spine. And bending your knees especially relieves spinal pressure,"" says Mischul Brownstone, a bodywork specialist in Charlotte, Vermont.1Exercise   <br /><br />Stomach Massage<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0603_stomach_massage.jpg"" /><br /><br /><b>Posture payback:</b> This move stretches your back, strengthens your abs and legs, and aids circulation and digestion. ""Good posture comes from a strong core, and Pilates strengthens the powerhouse,"" says Brooke Siler, author of <i>Your Ultimate Pilates Body Challenge</i>.<br /><br />Balance on your tailbone with knees bent shoulder-width apart and toes resting lightly on the mat. Reach forward with both arms and lift your spine up, imagining you're on a balance beam. Next, stretch your legs out and twist your upper body to follow the reach of one arm behind you. Keep your arms straight and think of chopping a tree behind you. Inhale as you reverse the twist, pulling your knees back toward your chest and lightly touching the mat with your toes. Repeat on the other side. 3-5Exercise   <br /><br />Prayer Pose<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0603_prayer_pose_1.jpg"" /><br /><br /><b>Posture payback:</b> It stretches your spine, arms, shoulders, glutes, and hamstrings and helps straighten your spine and neck. ""Slightly tilting your head back and folding your neck is common, but it's like crimping a garden hose -we can only guess what that's doing to your brain,"" says Jean Couch, owner of the Balance Center in Palo Alto, California. Couch also uses this move to correct the American habit of pushing the pelvis forward. (African women, according to a study in the science journal Nature, can carry 20 percent of their body weight on their heads - without expending a single extra calorie - because of their proper pelvis alignment.)<br /><br />Begin on all fours, with your knees and feet about a foot apart. Tip your butt bones up and move your torso back so that your hipbones rest on your thighs. Then walk your hands out, keeping your palms flat, until your forehead rests on the floor. Let your spine lengthen and your pelvis continue to rise up behind you.",Workouts

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/menstrual-cycle-relief,Health,15,10,1,2,2,18,0,0,,PMS: 3 Ways to Beat Your Period,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0601-painless-0430.jpg,"<br />Typical <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/pms-benefits"">PMS</a> advice isn't very useful. When you're suffering through crippling cramps, foul moods, and an urge to eat your weight in Nutter Butters, a handful of calcium supplements would better be used to pelt the individual who recommended them in the first place. And so 42 million of us still struggle with debilitating symptoms every month. The real key to easing that monthly scourge is to make a few simple lifestyle changes.<br /><br /><b>Get on the Floor</b> <br />A simple<a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/yoga/yoga-to-relieve-pms""> yoga pose</a> like a reclining bound angle will open up the pelvic area to relieve bloating, cramps, and fatigue, says Patricia Walden, author of <i>Yoga for a Healthy Menstrual Cycle</i>. To do: Sit on the floor with a long pillow behind you; the bottom should touch your sacrum and a folded blanket should cover the top. Lie back onto the pillow, resting head on the blanket. Put the soles of your feet together and let knees and thighs fall to the sides. Stay in the pose for 5 to 10 minutes, breathing deeply.<br /><br /><b>Avoid the Hershey's Diet</b> <br />Focus on small meals consisting of both protein and fiber to keep your blood sugar levels even, slow your rate of digestion, and reduce your urge to overeat, says Nadine Taylor, R.D., author of <i>25 Natural Ways to Relieve PMS</i>. See sample meal plan below.<br /><br /><b>Pop These Pills</b> <br />Ask your doc about tweaking your birth control regimen. In a recent Yale University School of Medicine study, oral contraceptives reduced PMS symptoms by 50 percent in nearly half of the participants using 24 hormone pills and 4 sugar pills. For severe mood swings, consider a class of antidepressants that increase your serotonin levels (like Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil).

For the iron, there would be a juicy, sizzling steak hot off the grill, lentils, or a platter of steamed clams. But time and effort - lack of the first and not enough energy for the second - keep us from the kitchen on most nights, meaning that nabbing nutrients the natural way just isn't the reality. <br /><br />The problem with not getting enough vitamins and minerals, studies show, is that missing even tiny amounts from our diets puts us at higher risk for illnesses ranging from heart disease to osteoporosis to cancer. <br /><br />Solution? Supplements. No, they're not whole foods, but they add well to what Mother Nature provides. So start putting these powerhouse vitamin and mineral tablets and capsules on your daily menu - they're critical to good health.<br /><br /><b>Multivitamin </b><p></p><p><b>Why take it?</b> ""I would put the multi-vitamin as top priority for women,"" says Harvard nutrition researcher Walter Willett, M.D. ""It's a safety net."" A lot of the nutrients that have been shown to protect against heart disease and cancer, such as folic acid and vitamin B12, are found in a multi. It's also a powerful tool against birth defects and iron deficiency.</p><p><b>How much?</b> Look for 100 percent of the Recommended Daily Allowance for most vitamins and essential minerals. What you don't need: trace elements like boron, nickel, silicon, tin, and vanadium or special ingredients like green tea, lycopene, and coenzyme Q10. Ditto for formulas with 200 or 300 percent or more of the RDA. That's just plain overkill. Overdosing on certain vitamins contained in a multi can have adverse health effects. Much more than 3,000 micrograms of vitamin A per day, for example, has been tied to birth defects and osteoporosis.</p><p><b>Best to buy</b> Any brand that sticks to 100 percent RDA across the board. Two good choices: Nature Made Essential Woman Complete Multi Vitamin/Mineral Supplement and Rainbow Light Just One Naturals Woman's One Multivitamin.</p><p><b>Tip</b> Take it with food to avoid upsetting your stomach.</p><p><b>Calcium + Vitamin D </b></p><p><b>Why take it?</b> Calcium strengthens bones; the vitamin D sends a message to the body to absorb the calcium. </p><p><b>How much?</b> 500 to 800 milligrams of elemental calcium and 400 international units of vitamin D per day. That's in addition to the recommended RDA of 400 IUs of vitamin D that should be in your multivitamin. Together you'll hit the right number: ""The optimal vitamin D intake looks like it should be at least 800 to 1,000 IUs per day,"" Dr. Willett estimates. He says studies show that most people have low levels of D in their blood, increasing risk for osteoporosis and fractures.</p><p><b>Best to buy</b> We like Os-Cal's new lemon chiffon chewable with 500 mg calcium carbonate, the most concentrated form of calcium, and 400 IUs of D. The box says to take two a day, but if you're taking a multi and eating two servings of dairy a day, one is probably enough.</p><p><b>Tip</b> Calcium is critical to preventing osteoporosis, but science shows that exercise is even more important, Dr. Willett says. ""The real bottom line is that if you want to avoid fractures, forget about milk and take your cow for a walk."" </p><p><b> Omega 3 Fats (Fish Oils)</b></p><p><b>Why take it?</b> They may be hard to pronounce, but the fats in fish oils, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are clear winners at preventing heart disease and stroke. Moms-to-betake note: DHA is also critical raw material for in utero brain development. </p><p><b>How much?</b> 1 gram per day. The capsule is going to contain a mix of EPA and DHA, but don't sweat the details. If you eat plenty of fish, though, you likely don't need this supplement: ""I would recommend that women obtain omega 3 fatty acids with two meals of fish per week,"" says William Connor, M.D., director of the division of endocrinology, diabetes, and clinical nutrition at Oregon Health & Science University.</p><p><b>Best to buy</b> We like Kirkland Signature Natural Fish Oil (Costco) because it's a good value: A recent Consumer Reports study found that generics are as safe and reliable as brands that cost up to 10 times as much. </p><p><b>Tip</b> Freeze capsules and take with meals to prevent burping up that fishy flavor. </p><p><b>Vitamin C </b></p><p><b>Why take it?</b> This water-soluble vitamin may help prevent breast cancer and lower blood pressure, but at levels much higher than the current RDA of 75 mg.</p><p><b>How much?</b> Some experts say 400 to 500 mg a day is the right amount to maximize blood and tissue levels of vitamin C. If you eat at least five servings, or 2.5 cups, of fruits and veggies a day, you'll easily get to about 250 mg, says Jane Higdon, Ph.D., a research associate at Oregon State University's Linus Pauling Institute. In that case, get the remaining 200 mg or so from a supplement. </p><p><b>Best to buy</b> Either natural or synthetic C; your body can't tell the difference. Skip formulations with ester (an antioxidant added to increase the shelf life of certain foods and drugs) and C paired with bioflavonoids; there's little evidence they help absorption. </p><p><b>Tip</b> Any more than 400 mg of C per day is a waste; your body can't use it. </p><p><b>Folate </b></p><p><b>Why take it?</b> Up to 70 percent of neural tube birth defects like spina bifida or anencephaly (a fatal brain and skull condition) could be prevented if women took in just the recommended dose of folate before and during pregnancy. As for heart disease, the jury is still out. But a new Dutch study finds that taking 800 micrograms of folic acid a day can help memory and mental function in postmenopausal women.</p><p><b>How much?</b> 400 micrograms. If your multi has you covered, skip the extra supplement unless you're looking for added benefits, like improved memory or possibly a lowered risk of heart disease. Be careful, though - the Food and Nutrition Board sets the upper safe limit for folate at 1,000 micrograms. Overdosing on folate can mask symptoms of a deficiency in B12, which is essential for normal nervous system function and blood cell production.</p><p><b>Best to buy</b> They're all the same; synthetic folic acid is synthetic folic acid.</p><p><b>Tip</b> The FDA requires all enriched grain products to be fortified with folic acid, but you'll need more to satisfy your needs.</p><p></p>",

Blend one cup of plain low-fat yogurt with half a cup each of frozen blueberries and blackberries, half a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and a pinch of ground cloves. Make extra and freeze it in individual portions for the rest of the week. Each night, move one smoothie into the fridge so it can defrost as you sleep, then grab it on your way out the door.</p><p><strong>Reroute Your Commute</strong><br />To shorten your commute time by 10 percent, avoid time-consuming left-hand turns on busy two-way streets by taking right turns instead. ""Minimizing left-hand turns reduces time spent idling at stoplights. Doing this shaved 29 million miles off UPS routes last year,"" says UPS spokesperson Dan McMackin.</p><p><strong>Take Five</strong><br />Focus on something for 25 minutes without interruption, then take a five-minute breather before diving back in. It sounds counterintuitive, but a pause can actually help you move faster. Taking breaks improves mental agility and boosts your output, says productivity expert Francesco Cirillo.</p><p><strong>Shop Smarter</strong><br />Screw spending hours digging through sale racks and hit up shopittome.com. Personalize your profile with your size and favorite brands (there are more than 700 options-everything from Levi's to Louboutins) and let the site do the legwork. It scours more than 200 retail sites and delivers a daily or weekly e-mail alerting you to steals in your size.</p><p><strong>Use the OHIO Method</strong><br />OHIO stands for Only Handle It Once-and it's the best way to tackle e-mails and voicemails. ""Decide immediately what to do with each message the first time you look at it, so you won't waste time going back to it later,"" says organization expert Peter Walsh, star of <em>Enough Already! With Peter Walsh</em>. That means trashing junk mail, taking care of any two-minute tasks right away, and adding the more time-consuming items to your to-do list or delegating them to someone else.</p><p><strong>Manage Drive-bys</strong><br />Keeping a spare chair and candy dish at your desk invites visitors to linger. Ditch the treats and pile your chair with paperwork when you really need to buckle down, says Jana Kemp, author of <em>No! How One Simple Word Can Transform Your Life</em>.</p><p><strong>Burn More Fat in Less Time</strong><br />Eight to 12 minutes of intense intervals can burn as many calories as 25 to 30 minutes of constant moderate-exertion exercise, says Jonathan Ross, American Council on Exercise personal trainer of the year and author of Abs Revealed. Pick your favorite cardio machine and do one minute at a high intensity (at least a 7 or 8 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being all-out effort) followed by rest or a very low intensity (2 or 3 on the same scale) for one minute.</p><p><strong>Move the Clock</strong><br />Waking up a mere 15 minutes earlier pads your morning with precious time to leisurely drink your coffee as you open mail or pick out what to wear. To keep from hitting the snooze button, put your clock in the bathroom, says Kyle Pott, cofounder of Bowtie Hype, a personal productivity and goal-setting consultancy. You'll have to get out of bed to turn off the alarm, and hey, the shower's right there. Hop in!</p>",

Learn <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/talk-like-a-man"">how to talk to a man</a> after he tells you he...<br /><b><br />...has herpes--and that's why you still haven't shtupped</b></p><p>This doesn't necessarily mean what you think it means and it may not have to be a dating deal breaker. ""When people hear<i> STD,</i> they think <i>promiscuous,""</i> says Carole Marks, M.D., associate director of the department of family medicine at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. ""But just one bad decision can lead to a lifetime of painful breakouts."" You may be angry that he's been holding out on you, but remember that he's announcing his <a>chlamydia</a>-symptoms-and-basic-information"">STD to try to save you from being exposed. And there's nothing easy about confessing this sex secret. ""He's probably terrified that you'll reject him,"" says marriage and family therapist Bethany Marshall, Ph.D., author of <i>Deal Breakers: When to Work On a Relationship and When to Walk Away.</i> ""He's feeling vulnerable, embarrassed, and possibly even ashamed."" Don't demand that he spill his entire sexual history, but do ask him how and when the diagnosis was made--and whether he's been tested for other STDs. ""Find out if he's on suppression therapy; Valtrex, a daily oral medication, in addition to using <a href=""/health/best-condoms"">condoms</a>, reduces the risk of transmission,"" Marks says. If he isn't, ask him to look into it for your sake. Be honest about how willing you are to risk getting the disease. ""The fact that he has herpes is not necessarily a deal-breaker,"" Marshall says. ""But you might want to delay having sex until you're sure the relationship is serious.""</p><p><b>...wants to quit his job to ""find himself""</b></p><p>Where, exactly, is he planning to look? ""Ask him how he thinks this transitional phase will affect the relationship and how long he sees the transition lasting,"" says Nancy D. O'Reilly, Psy.D., a clinical psychologist based in Springfield, Missouri. ""If he's vague about what he wants to achieve and how he plans to achieve it, be worried."" Backing his resolve to seek a more fulfilled life doesn't mean giving him license to play with his Xbox 360 all day. Your honey should be able to soul-search and pull his weight at the same time, whether that means doing chores or getting a part-time job. If your combined income will drop significantly, ""work together to create a practical plan for the immediate future that addresses your needs too,"" says Don Rosenthal, co-author of <i>Learning to Love: From Conflict to Lasting Harmony. </i>Come up with a budget that shows how your household will operate on less money and avoid sacrifices you'll resent him for later; if you need a monthly massage to stay sane, insist on it. <br /><b><br />...secretly withdrew money from your joint savings to buy a new flat-screen TV </b></p><p>Stifle your urge to even the score with a pair of Louboutins. The issue here is secrecy, not cash. ""Call him on his sneakiness and unilateral decision-making, but don't be hostile,"" says Daniel L. Buccino, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Instead, express confusion. Open with this line: ""Help me understand what you were thinking when you spent our money without checking in with me."" Move into an ""I feel"" statement, such as ""I feel hurt and betrayed when you make big decisions without talking to me first""--and finish with a plan of action, Buccino advises. To avoid future impasses, Scott Haltzman, M.D., co-author of <i>The Secrets of Happily Married Women, </i>suggests allotting half an hour every week to talk about financial goals for your shared accounts and how to use funds. Another good idea: Set up ""yours,"" ""mine,"" and ""ours"" bank accounts. ""Adults need 'no-questions-asked' money of their own,"" says Liz Pulliam Weston, the author of <i>Easy Money: How to Simplify Your Finances and Get What You Want Out of Life.</i> For big-ticket items, collaboration is still a must.</p><p><b>...changed his mind and doesn't want kids</b></p><p>""This is an instant deal-breaker,"" says Leah Klungness, Ph.D., a psychologist and co-author of <i>The Complete Single Mother. </i>""It's a clear message, and it's essential to understand that this likely is not negotiable."" Changing his mind about his career, where to live, or where to vacation won't have life-altering consequences, Klungness says, but ""children are the only 'always and forever' commitment."" If having kids is a must-have for you, hoping he'll magically come around to your point of view only sets you up for disappointment. Klungness adds that news like this involves an element of duplicity. ""Perhaps what he's truly reconsidering is building a future with you,"" she says. ""You deserve better than parenthood with a man who has been and may continue to be less than truthful."" </p><p><b>...slept with his best female friend before he met you</b></p><p>Alrighty, then. But why is he telling you now? ""Unless you asked for the declaration, this confession seems potentially cruel and hurtful; it doesn't help deepen or advance the current relationship,"" Buccino says. Which is exactly what you should explain to him. If he can't give a logical reason for why he felt compelled to confess, make cutthroat inquiries: How long ago did it happen? Does he ever feel tempted to do it again? Does he have deeper feelings for her--or anyone else? Provided you don't have a history of unfounded jealousy, use your gut to interpret his responses. Trust your feelings, and accept the truth, even if it's painful. By the end of it all, you'll know where you stand--and whether that will be next to him.</p>",

But trying to figure out why you're doubled over with cramps or swapping out supersize tampons every hour? Not so much. Sadly, millions of women (and a whole lot of docs) are perplexed by pelvic problems. Learn how to help your physician spot and deal with the down-there maladies that affect women the most.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>6.3 Million Suffer from Endometriosis</b><br /><br /><br />When Senie Byrne, 25, of Manassas, Virginia, was 15 her periods were accompanied by vomiting and cramps so bad she would often pass out from the pain. She went from doctor to doctor until finally, at age 21, she found out she had endometriosis, a uterine disease that can take a decade to diagnose.<br /><br /><br /><br />When a woman has endometriosis, the uterine lining (the one you're supposed to shed each month during your period) gets stuck elsewhere. It can travel down through your cervix and vagina, but also up through your fallopian tubes, where it can attach to your bowel, bladder, or ovaries. The latter path can disrupt hormonal cycles and lead to thick scarring, inflammation, and heavy bleeding during menstruation, says Tommaso Falcone, M.D., chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at the Cleveland Clinic. It can also result in killer cramps, painful sex, <a href=""/health/conditions/diarrhea"">diarrhea</a>, or constipation- or no aches at all. ""The peculiar thing is that the amount of pain you're in may have no correlation to the amount of <a href=""/health/conditions/endometriosis"">endometriosis</a> you have,"" says ob-gyn Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., of the Yale University School of Medicine.<br /><br /><br /><br />But even pain-free patients are at risk of a troubling side effect: infertility. About 38 percent of infertile women can blame <a href=""/health/conditions/endometriosis"">endometriosis</a>, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, often because of scarring or inflammation. Endometrial tissue also releases fluid that can mess with egg-sperm interaction. The best way to preserve fertility is to catch and treat the problem early.<br /><br /><br /><br />Scientists aren't sure exactly what causes endometriosis, but they do know that genetics plays a leading role in risk (if your mom or sister has it, your chances increase sixfold); exposure to pollutants such as dioxin, a chemical used in pesticides and bleached paper, might also be a prime risk factor. For now, the only way to score a definitive diagnosis is through surgery. ""To be sure, we have to physically see this tissue living where it doesn't belong,"" explains ob-gyn Shari Brasner, M.D., of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. This procedure involves general anesthesia and a camera exploring the inner abdomen and pelvis. If a physician finds any wayward tissue, it can often be removed right then, though it can grow back. The good news: Less-invasive diagnostic procedures (including in-office biopsies and blood tests to measure inflammation levels) should be available within three to five years, says Falcone.<br /><br /><br /><br />Of course, after getting the diagnosis, you still have to live with the condition, which can come and go or persist for as long as you menstruate. Birth control can decrease the pain and bleeding, and hormone-manipulating drugs such as danazol and Lupron can shrink the growths by ""turning off"" the ovaries. (Similarly, ""pregnancy will keep endometrial tissue quiet because your hormones aren't cycling,"" says Brasner.) Scientists are now studying how anti-progesterone and breast-cancer drugs may help.<br /><br /><br /><br />If Rx medicines don't yield relief, alternative treatments like acupuncture may ease pain. And if nothing else works, more surgery may be in order. But the crucial thing is for each endometriosis patient to receive a tailored health plan that lets her move past the pain and get on with her life.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>5 to 7 Million Have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)</b><br /><br /><br />Its calling cards are irregular periods, acne, excessive facial and body hair, and weight gain. But each of those symptoms could signal a variety of issues, especially during teenage years, when PCOS-the most common hormonal illness in young women-typically first strikes. That's why many patients spend years searching for a diagnosis, says Andrea Dunaif, M.D., an endocrinologist at Northwestern University in Chicago. And that's worrisome because women with PCOS-especially if it's left untreated- are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and endometrial cancer.<br /><br /><br /><br />Though the root causes remain unknown, PCOS happens when the ovaries produce an unusually high amount of male hormones like testosterone, which tamper with ovulation and in many cases, the body's sensitivity to insulin. For Katy Teer, 32, of St. Clair Shores, Michigan, the condition led to strange facial hair and an ever-expanding waistline, starting at age 13. ""I rarely had normal periods, but doctors always blamed that on my weight,"" she says. At age 28, she finally got a diagnosis. Because there's no definitive blood or imaging test, Katy's docs looked at three criteria: irregular periods, elevated male hormones, and ovarian cysts seen on ultrasounds.<br /><br /><br /><br />PCOS has no cure or FDA-approved drug-docs can only treat the major symptoms. Oral contraceptives can help suppress male hormones and normalize cycles, says Richard S. Legro, M.D., an ob-gyn at the Penn State College of Medicine. And physicians often use spironolactone, a kidney drug, off-label to nix unwanted hair growth. PCOS patients who struggle with fertility are also sometimes prescribed Clomid, a drug that induces ovulation; the diabetes med metformin is often given to help restore regular cycles and reduce diabetes risk.<br /><br /><br /><br />If that sounds like a lot of pills, it is. But PCOS symptoms, especially weight gain, can also be controlled through diet and exercise. ""Many patients find that a diet moderate in carbs and high in lean protein helps them handle their hunger and consume fewer calories,"" says Hillary Wright, R.D., a nutrition counselor in Boston and author of <i>The PCOS Diet Plan</i>. Plus, ""losing just 5 to 10 percent of your weight can lead to the resumption of normal periods and lower male hormone levels,"" says Dunaif.<br /><br /><br /><br />As with every illness, the most important step is working together with your M.D. on a plan that's right for you. Once Katy Teer started taking metformin and a low-dose birth-control pill, her day-today life became much more manageable. ""I lost more than 40 pounds,"" she says. ""I'm still overweight, even though I walk four miles a day, but I stopped getting facial hair, my periods are more regular, and my blood pressure is under control."" So is her fertility: In 2007, she became a mother.<br /><br /></p><p></p><b>124 Million May Have Uterine Fibroids</b><br /><br /><br />Fibroids' main symptom, big-time bloat, can make you look knocked up when you're not. And like endometriosis and PCOS, they can cause extra-heavy bleeding and gut-wrenching cramps during your period, as well as constant pressure on your bladder or rectum. That said, some sufferers show zero symptoms.<br /><br /><br /><br />Doctors aren't sure what causes these balls of muscle (which can range from the size of a grape to a honeydew melon) to grow in the uterus, but new research suggests that exposure to phthalates (chemicals found in plastics and personal-care products) may play a part. Because fibroids feed on estrogen, they can become a nuisance during pregnancy, when female hormone levels run high, says Lissa Rankin, M.D., an ob-gyn in Mill Valley, California. They also share living space with the fetus, increasing the risk of miscarriage or preterm birth.<br /><br /><br /><br />While fibroids are relatively simple to diagnose-usually with an ultrasound or MRI- deciding on a treatment isn't so easy. Birth-control pills and hormone-disrupting meds can shrink the masses, but the ultimate fix is a hysterectomy- a drastic step for young women. However, there are newer, less-severe treatments that can help eliminate fibroids: myolysis (laser removal), myomectomy (surgical removal), and uterine artery embolization (the injection of foam into arteries to cut off fibroids' blood supply). Also showing early promise are two noninvasive experimental treatments: radio-frequency ablation, which uses heat energy to destroy any unwarranted growths, and MRI-guided ultrasound surgery, which blasts fibroids into smithereens.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Two Others to Watch For</i><br /><br /><br /><b>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)</b><br /><br /><br />A bacterial infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and other reproductive organs. Often a complication of STD s such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, PID causes infertility in one out of five sufferers.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Patients:</i> More than a million women<br /><br /><br /><i>Symptoms:</i> Severe abdominal or pelvic pain, nausea, high fever, vomiting, and a profuse and malodorous vaginal discharge<br /><br /><br /><i>Treatments:</i> Antibiotics, along with pain meds that can range from ibuprofen to narcotics<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Vulvodynia</b><br /><br /><br />Chronic pain and burning in the vulva<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Patients:</i> Approximately 6 million women<br /><br /><br /><i>Symptoms:</i> Discomfort, pain, and a stinging sensation around the vaginal opening; pain or serious tenderness during sex or when inserting a tampon<br /><br /><br /><i>Treatments:</i> Anti-inflammatory drugs, local anesthetics, low doses of tricyclic antidepressants, biofeedback, or pelvic physical therapy<br /><br /><p></p>",Better Sex

With a 10-minute workout, you can pump your muscles to make them appear leaner and stronger than they usually do. </p><p><b>How it works:</b> Normally, when you're<a href=""/fitness/workouts""> lifting weights</a>, your muscles contract and apply pressure to the blood vessels running through them. This impedes the normal flow of blood and oxygen (that's why weight training is called an anaerobic exercise). When you're done, the pressure subsides and backed-up blood and oxygen floods in, temporarily expanding your muscles. That increase in bloodflow is what can give you a post-workout pump. </p><p>To get the maximum amount of volume, just tweak your current workout a bit: Lower the weight and increase the number of repetitions you perform. A study published in <i>Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise</i> concluded that the time between the end of your workout and the return of blood to your muscles is 44 percent longer when you perform 15 repetitions at 60 percent of your maximum compared with 4 repetitions at 90 percent. And the longer it takes for the blood to fill your muscles, the longer your post-exercise look will last. </p><p>Here's a part-by-part workout for a maximum arms or abs pump in minimum time. </p><p><b>Chest</b><br />Perform as many pushups as you can in 1 minute. Without resting, move into a modified pushup position, your knees on the floor. Perform as many modified pushups as you can in 1 minute. Then, raise yourself back up into pushup position (knees off the floor now) and lower your chest until it's about 2 inches off the floor. Hold that position for 20 seconds-or as long as you can. Rest for 30 to 45 seconds and repeat the sequence for a total of 3 sets. </p><p><b>Arms</b><br />Do these two exercises in row. Repeat the sequence three times. </p><p>•<b><a href=""/fitness/dip-0"">Bench dips</a>:</b> Place your hands behind you on the edge of a bench and your feet on another bench a few feet in front of you. Ask someone to place a few small weight plates on your lap. Lower your body toward the floor until your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Keep your torso straight. Pause, then press back to the starting position. As you fatigue, ask your spotter to remove one weight plate at a time and continue until you can't do any more dips with only your body weight. Then, place your feet flat on the floor withyour knees bent as if you were seated in an invisible chair; lower your body as before, completing as many repetitions as you can. </p><p>•<b>Preacher curls:</b> Holding a curl bar (a short barbell with curves in it for your hands), sit at a preacher curl stand. Lower the weight so your arms are straight, then curl it up so your hands are pointed toward the ceiling. Start with a weight that's about 80 percent of your maximum and do as many repetitions as you can. Remove 10 to 15 percent of the weight and start curling again without rest. Continue removing weight and curling to failure until you can no longer curl the bar by itself. </p><p><b>Abs</b><br />To pump your abs, start your <a href=""/fitness/great-abs-0"">abs workout</a> and target your obliques. By tiring out your obliques first, you'll take them out of the equation when you work your eight-pack rectus abdominis muscle, making your standard ab workout even more effective. </p>","Better Sex,Decode Him,relationships"

Forman loves to pose this mind-screw to his study subjects because he knows that thoughts are like zits-they pop up whether you want them to or not. And that's the problem with cravings. ""While there are things you can do to manage cravings, you can't stop yourself from thinking about the foods you love,"" Forman says.<br /><br />Unlike run-of-the-mill hunger, cravings-intense desires for certain foods-seem to be linked to our brain's reward system. Emotions, situations, or pleasant associations (Grandma fed you Little Debbie snack cakes) can trigger a craving, says Susan Roberts, Ph.D., director of the Energy Metabolism Laboratory at the Tufts University Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging. When you eat a food you crave, your brain releases dopamine, a natural chemical related to pleasure. It's the same reward system you get from sex or illegal drugs, ""but it's at much lower concentrations,"" Roberts says.<br /><br />So what to do the next time you start jonesing for a pumpkin spice latte when you're already stuffed from lunch? The following stay-slim strategies will boost your ability to just say no. And don't miss <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/permanent-weight-loss"">""Laws of Lasting Weight Loss""</a> for more craving-cutting tips.<br /><br /><b>Craving Killer No. 1 Accept Defeat</b><br />Playing head games isn't the only way Forman and his colleagues torture dieters in the name of science. They gave 98 study participants a questionnaire to determine how susceptible they were to food urges, then loaded them up with transparent boxes of Hershey's Kisses they had to keep with them at all times for the next 48 hours. Those who proved most successful at fighting temptation used an acceptance-based strategy they had been taught: Acknowledge the craving, accept it, and choose not to act on it. When you're struck by the desire for that double-fudge cake, practice what Forman calls cognitive ""defusion"": Instead of trying to ignore the craving, admit to yourself that you want a slice. It works on the same principle as getting the hots for a coworker when you're in a great relationship: Recognizing that you'll always be attracted to cute guys (or yummy food) prevents you from acting on the feeling every time it comes up.<br /> <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/cravings-be-gone?page=2""><b>See more craving killers</b></a><b></b></p><p> <b>Craving Killer No. 2 Give in-a little</b><br /><br />Now this is our kind of news: Recent research from Tufts University revealed that surrendering to a craving is sometimes the best course of action-as long as you can practice portion control. In a study of 32 overweight women, all averaged an 8 percent weight loss after 12 months, but those who had the greatest <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-success-story-23"">weight loss success</a> gave in to their cravings occasionally. When they did indulge, they ate small amounts-just enough to be satisfied, says Roberts, one of the study's co-authors. The key is practicing restraint, not deprivation. ""When you forbid a food, it only becomes more attractive, and you become likely to overeat,"" says Janet Polivy, Ph.D., professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. So when you need to feed the cocoa monster, reach for a prepackaged snack, such as Entenmann's Little Bites 100 Calorie Pack Brownie Squares, and call it a day. You'll be much less likely to break down and attack an entire hot fudge sundae. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/100-calorie-snacks"">For more crave-crushing low-calories snacks, see ""Portion Control.""</a><br /><br /><b>Craving Killer No. 3 Fantasize</b><br /><br />Being told to think of something else when you're in the grip of a powerful craving is about as helpful as being told to swim when you're drowning. But there is one way that advice can work: Researchers at Flinders University in Australia found that occupying your senses with a vivid non-food fantasy just might stifle your urge.<br /><br />""Your short-term memory has limited storage,"" says study author Eva Kemps. To conjure any image-nachos or that spring break in Cancun-you need to pull them out of your long-term memory, the way an iPod cues up one song at a time from the gazillion it has in storage. But short-term memory has only so much room; it can't play ""Cheeseburger in Paradise"" and ""Holiday"" at the same time. ""The idea is to keep your short-term memory busy by fantasizing about something else,"" Kemps says.<br /><br />It worked for Kemps's study participants. When they were asked to drum up remembered smells and sights-the scent of freshly cut grass or a log fire, and images such as a hot-air balloon or the Sydney Opera House-their cravings for chocolate (which was right in front of them) were reduced by about 30 percent. Their minds couldn't handle the craving and the new sensory imagery at the same time, so the craving got dumped. Try thinking about what your guy looks like in nothing but a towel-you might forget all about that cookie.<br /><br /><b>Craving Killer No. 4 Swap smart</b><br /><br />No one has ever made a longing for a jelly doughnut disappear by gnawing on celery sticks. But that doesn't mean substitutions never work. It's all about satisfying your appetite. The secret, Roberts says, is to get the flavor you want with minimal caloric damage. If you can't stop thinking about caramel corn, try LesserEvil ""SinNamon"" kettle corn (one cup has about 120 calories and 2 grams of fat). Or, give in to a sweet tooth with fruit-natural sugar can be amazingly satisfying. ""Sometimes you have to reinvent a sweet,"" says Cheryl Forberg, R.D., nutritionist for the TV show <i>The Biggest Loser.</i> Try frozen grapes instead of popsicles and fresh cherries instead of candy. Take a bite from the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/files/best-supermarket-foods/index.html"">""100 Best Supermarket Foods""</a> list for more subs you can savor.<br /><br />One caveat: When it comes to chocolate (one of the most-craved foods in the world), it's better not to accept imitations. A study from the University of Toronto found that chronic dieters didn't have as much trouble resisting vanilla as they did chocolate. The reason, Polivy says, may be that although vanilla cravings may be sated by other flavors, like cinnamon or butterscotch, chocolate is unique-nothing else seems to hit the spot.<br /><br />When you do indulge, keep an eye on how much. Get your fix in small (about 150-calorie) doses-that's two chocolate truffles or one snack-size chocolate bar. And don't tempt yourself by keeping supersize chocolate bars and trays of brownies at the ready-we already know who'll win that bet. </p><p> </p><p><i><b>Snack smart with these <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/100-calories-quiz"">100 calorie options</a>! </b></i></p>",Eating Strategies

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/chocolate-health,Nutrition,7,9,10,1,0,0,1,0,,Eat Chocolate for Your Health,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1101-chocolate-article.jpg,"<p>Rich, seductive, orgasmic.<br /><br /><br /><br />When you let a piece of chocolate melt on your tongue, you know why the Mayans called it the food of the gods. And not only is it one of the most delectable, irresistible, and often-craved flavors on earth-it's actually good for you. Sure, you've no doubt discovered that chocolate is useful for self-medicating after a day from hell, but research also links moderate consumption to a wide-ranging list of health perks.<br /><br /><br /><br />Like other fruits-and it is a fruit-the cocoa bean gets its wonder-food status from a surplus of antioxidants and other nutrients. In fact, raw cocoa is even richer in flavonols (which are kind of supercharged antioxidants) than berries or tea.<br /><br /><br /><br />Besides mopping up health-damaging free radicals, flavonols aid blood flow, which is why studies have connected cocoa to lower blood pressure and decreased risk of heart attack and stroke. Chocolate may even be able to amp your brainpower because it improves circulation to your noggin, which helps with memory and learning, and may guard against <a href=""/health/conditions/dementia"">dementia</a>, says Lauren Graf, R.D., a dietitian at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City.<br /><br /><br /><br />Other antioxidants in chocolate play a role in everything from boosting immune function (a <i>British Journal of Nutrition</i> study suggests that cocoa can help rev up T-cell activity, increasing the body's ability to fend off viruses) to helping muscles recover after a tough workout. And it's no coincidence that your mood improves after a few morsels. Cocoa contains natural stimulants, including theobromine and phenylethyamine, that raise levels of the feel-good chemical serotonin in our brains.<br /><br /><br /><br />To reap these and other benefits, you don't need to eat a lot of chocolate-most studies have found that one ounce a day is plenty-but you should make sure that it's at least 50 percent cocoa. And if a product doesn't list the cocoa content, or if the label has the words <i>processed with alkali</i> or <i>Dutch processed</i> on it, then most of the antioxidants have been destroyed during processing, says Graf.<br /><br /><br /><br />Of course, while higher cocoa content means more flavonoids, it also means less sweetness, says Monica Bearden, R.D., author of <i>Chocolate: A Healthy Passion</i>. That's because less fat and sugar are added to cut the bitterness of the flavonols. Bearden's advice: Start with a variety that has a lower cocoa content and work your way up to let your palate get used to the flavor.<br /><br /><br /><br />Better yet, use the cocoa bean's bitterness to your benefit by cooking-not just baking-with it. ""Chocolate can add richness and a bittersweet earthy component to a large variety of savory dishes,"" says David Suarez, culinary director of Rosa Mexicano restaurants. ""In dishes with some spicy element, such as chili, chocolate helps balance out the heat."" It also pairs surprisingly well with citrus fruits and different meats-and, of course, it's perfect for desserts. Give these cocoa-rich recipes a try and you may discover a whole new dimension to this heavenly food.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a target=""_self"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/easy-chocolate-recipes"">See the delicious chocolate recipes!</a><br /><br /></p>",Getting Started
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/brooklyn-decker-interview,Life,34,9,14,0,0,0,0,0,,Swimsuit Model: Brooklyn in the House,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1009-brooklyn-decker.jpg,"When you're 5'10"" with sparkling blue eyes, flowing blond hair, and a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/set/?keycode=142686"">traffic-stopping body</a>, come-ons from guys are de rigueur. But a recent encounter took 23-year-old Brooklyn Decker by surprise.<br /><br />While walking down the street in Santa Monica, California, she was approached by a race-car driver from Pennsylvania, who explained he was looking for girls to be on a calendar.<p></p><p>""It's classy,"" he assured. ""You'll wear my racing jersey and lie on my car, and I'll take pictures. You got an agent?""</p><p>Brooklyn could have responded that she's with the Marilyn modeling agency, one of the biggest in the world. Or asked the guy if he happened to catch her on the cover of the <i>Sports Illustrated</i> Swimsuit Issue earlier this year. Or informed him that she'd just wrapped a movie due out in February called <i>Just Go With It</i>, starring Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler.</p><p>But that's just not Brooklyn's style. Instead, she heard the guy out, waited a few beats, and then let him down easy: ""You know, I'm under contract with a company, so I can't do anything other than that. But I appreciate the offer and wish you the best of luck.""<br /><br /><b>Nice Girls Finish First</b><br />Two days later, relaxing after her <i>Women's Health</i> cover shoot, she good-naturedly shrugs off the pinup proposal, saying, ""He was really nice about it."" Curled up on a sofa, Brooklyn looks stunning in a loose-fitting bohemian-print top and skinny jeans. But the most striking thing about her is how down-to-earth and, well, nice she is. She's more of a hugger than a handshaker, and she effusively thanks people for the most insignificant of gestures, like when a member of the photo crew retrieves the iPhone she had left in another room. ""It's like she's somebody out of a Jimmy Stewart movie,"" marvels Dennis Dugan, director of <i>Just Go With It</i>.<br /><br />In actuality, she grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina. The daughter of a nurse and a sales associate at a medical company, Brooklyn wanted to become a broadcaster or a veterinarian. But that was before a modeling scout discovered her at a mall when she was 16. She moved to New York two years later and snagged a spot in <i>Sports Illustrated's</i> Swimsuit Issue a week after landing in the city. Still, she believed that in order to hit it big in an industry in which flat chests and bony clavicles rule, she had to shrink down. ""I have a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/set/?keycode=142686"">curvy body</a>. I have boobs. I'm a size 4. In modeling, that's often too big,"" she says.</p><p>For a while, she did juice fasts to try to drop pounds quickly, but a pep talk from her dad convinced her to stop that craziness and focus on working out and eating well. ""Oddly enough,"" she says, ""[after that] more people wanted to work with me.""</p><p>Advertising campaigns for the Gap and Victoria's Secret followed, as did offers for guest spots on shows such as <i>Ugly Betty</i>. Then came a plum role in the upcoming movie <i>Just Go With It</i>, playing Adam Sandler's love interest. She praises her costars for being ""amazingly kind"" and dismisses rumors of Jennifer Aniston's on-set jealousy as ""totally bogus...I couldn't have had a bigger supporter.""</p><p>No doubt, Brooklyn's goofy personality helped endear her to the cast. ""When people hear 'bikini model,' they have one thing on their mind,"" she says. ""Then they see you're someone who shows up to the set in pajamas and no makeup, watches sports, and belches.""</p><p><b>Body of Work</b><br />And by the way, that enviably toned body doesn't come easy. ""I remember hearing some model say, 'I eat pizza and cheeseburgers all the time,' and thinking, <i>How could she [and still] look like that?</i>"" says Brooklyn. ""I want people to know that you have to work hard, but it's worth it."" To stay in shape, she hits the gym five days a week. ""My workouts are well-rounded,"" says Brooklyn, who jokingly cops to a mild case of exercise ADD. Her hour-long sessions are a mix of cardio (running, Spinning class, or using the elliptical machine), ab moves, and weight training. She also loves<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/set/?keycode=142686"">exercising</a> outdoors-while filming on location in Hawaii, she spent time hiking and kayaking.<br /><br />Taping her <i>Make Better</i> series of fitness DVDs (due out in September) introduced Brooklyn to the benefits of yoga, which she had initially written off as ""a wimpy workout."" But a month spent with yoga expert and WH contributor Tara Stiles had her singing a different tune. ""She was skeptical,"" recalls Stiles, whose new yoga book is excerpted on page 124 of this issue. ""But after our sessions she'd say, 'I had no idea yoga could be so challenging! I'm getting a <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/set/?keycode=142686"">good workout</a>, but afterward, I feel so relaxed.' ""</p><p>Brooklyn is equally disciplined about her diet. Breakfast is typically an egg-white omelet with feta or goat cheese, asparagus, and broccoli, or fat-free Greek yogurt with blueberries. Lunch might be chicken piccata and a salad. On the dinner menu: lean meat or tuna with veggies. She also nibbles throughout the day, fueling up on granola bars, veggies like carrots or cauliflower, and hummus. She allows herself the occasional indulgence though-usually in the form of candy, chocolate-chip cookies, or ice cream. ""I have an insane sweet tooth,"" she says. ""I could go without fried foods for the rest of my life, but I couldn't give up sweets.""<br /> <br /><b>Living the Happily Married Life</b><br />Fortunately, she has found a guy who shares her balanced outlook. Brooklyn met her match, tennis star Andy Roddick, 27, in 2007. Andy spotted her on TV and asked his agent to set up a meeting-and as soon as Brooklyn saw him, she was hooked. ""[When I met him] I was like, <i>Uh-oh, I'm in trouble</i>,"" she recalls. They got married two years later and now split their time between Austin, Texas, and Brooklyn, New York (""It's Brooklyn in Brooklyn, which is ridiculous,"" she says). The pair love to chill out at home, watching movies and sports. ""I'm one of the buddies, hanging out in my hoodie and jeans,"" says Brooklyn.<br /><br />When the two venture out, it's usually to a favorite Italian restaurant or a bowling alley (""The one thing I can beat Andy at!"" she says). They are also known for throwing silly events like ""tacky sweater parties"" around the holidays. ""Married life suits me,"" says Brooklyn. ""And with all this stuff swirling around me professionally, it's fun to have someone to celebrate with.""</p><p>For now, she's focused on broadening her acting repertoire by perhaps taking on an indie comedy a la <i>Little Miss Sunshine</i> or an action movie. ""It would be awesome to be a butt-kicking badass,"" she says. Ultimately, though, Brooklyn sees herself settled in Austin, shuttling back and forth between New York and L.A. for work. ""I want to live a normal life-drive my kids to school, have tons of animals running around, be barefoot and pregnant. I want all that,"" she says. Then quickly adds: ""Just not anytime soon.""</p><p><b>Check out scenes from Brooklyn's cover shoot:</b></p><p></p>",healthy eating

And given all the good-for-you hype on labels, it's near impossible to tell which is best. We asked experts Walter Willett, M.D., professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, and Robert P. Heaney, M.D., professor of medicine at Creighton University, to help us wade through gallons of the white stuff and determine what belongs in your <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/healthy-breakfast-cereals"">ceral bowl</a>.<br /><br /><b>1st, <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/premium-packaged-foods"">Cow Milk</a>, Fat Free (Skim)</b><br /><br />It's a tight race between our gold and silver winners, but according to a new study in the <i>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</i>, the protein in cow's milk is the best milk and twice as good at building muscle after a workout as its soy counterpart. And without the saturated fat of whole milk, skim won't strain the 2 percent spandex in your jeans.<br /><br /><b>Per cup :</b> 30% calcium DV, 25% vitamin D DV, 80-90 calories, 0 g fat, 8 g protein, 12 g sugar<br /><br /><b>Sour spot:</b> Liz Hurley and other svelte celebs didn't get their ""body by milk."" The National Dairy Council stopped touting the link between milk and weight loss because research didn't support it.<br /><br /><b>Average half gallon:</b> $3.05<br /><br /><b>Quick tip:</b> You don't have to avoid plastic milk jugs anymore. New opaque containers shield the good stuff from nutrient damaging light.<br /><br /><b>2nd, <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/best-packaged-foods-for-women"">Soy Milk</a>, Light, Unflavored, Enriched with Calcium and Vitamin D</b><br /><br />A godsend for milk lovers with dairy allergies, thick, nutty soy milk could help lower your LDL (""bad"") cholesterol a few points, and some studies show that it may help protect against breast cancer. Going light and unflavored (i.e., plain) allows you to skip extra sugar -- chocolate and vanilla flavors can have two to three times as much.<br /><br /><b>Per cup:</b> 20-30% calcium DV, 10-30% vitamin D DV, 90-127 calories, 4 g fat (0.5 g saturated), 7-11 g protein, 1-7 g sugar<br /><br /><b>Sour spot:</b> Like Hoobastank, soy's rock star status has waned in the past few years. Scientists can't seem to prove that it's a significant ally against heart disease, other cancers, or osteoporosis.<br /><br /><b>Average half gallon:</b> $2.80<br /><br /><b>Quick tip:</b> Calcium settles to the bottom of the container. Give the carton a big shake before you pour.<br /><br /><b>3rd, Oat Milk, Low Fat, Enriched with Calcium and Vitamin D</b><br /><br />Craving variety (or really allergy-prone)? Oat milk, which tastes like Quaker Instant with sugar mixed in, contains 2 grams of fiber per serving (half of which is the soluble, cholesterol-lowering kind). The other grain option, rice milk, is not much more than sugar water with a few added nutrients. Skip it.<br /><br /><b>Per cup:</b> 35% calcium DV, 25% vitamin D DV, 130 calories, 2.5 g fat (0 g saturated), 4 g protein, 19 g sugar<br /><br /><b>Sour spot:</b> Oat's low protein means it's less than stellar for active babes looking to build muscle.<br /><br /><b>Average half gallon:</b> $5.50<br /><br /><b>Quick tip:</b> Its sweet taste makes it a healthy alternative to cream.

Still, her figure was more like ""a football player's,"" she says, than like those of her slim, fit friends. And when she began attending Arizona State University, she grew careless with her eating habits. ""My best friend and I got an apartment-and too many groceries,"" recalls the 29-year-old e-learning training consultant from Phoenix. ""By sophomore year, my eating was out of control."" Along with scarfing too many bagels and bowls of pasta, Brandi let her workouts wane. She packed 40 pounds onto her 5'3"" frame in just 18 months. <br /><br /><b>The Change</b><br />Several months before Brandi was to be a bridesmaid in her best friend's October 2009 wedding, she couldn't squeeze into the gown she'd ordered. ""I could never tell my friend that I couldn't be in her wedding because my dress didn't fit!"" she says. She vowed not only to sport the size-6 dress but to shed the extra pounds for good.<br /><br /><b>The Lifestyle</b><br />Brandi started slowly, eating smaller meals and bringing snacks of veggies and fruit to work. To avoid flaking on workouts, she kept fitness clothes in her car and drove straight to the gym after work to jump on a stair-climber or catch a kickboxing or spin class and lift weights. ""There was no room for excuses,"" she says. ""I had done this to myself, and I was determined to undo it!"" Brandi got down to 135 pounds-enough to fit into the bridesmaid dress. By September 2010, she reached her goal weight in time for her own wedding. <br /><br /><b>The Reward</b><br />Today, the bridesmaid dress that wouldn't zip is two sizes too big. And in addition to flaunting a much slimmer silhouette on her own big day, she proudly sported a bikini on her Cancún honeymoon. ""I have more confidence than ever,"" she says, ""and a lot more energy. I feel completely revived!""<br /><br /><b>Brandi's Tips </b><br /><b>Dress greens for success.</b> ""I mix lemon juice, olive oil, and Dijon mustard to drizzle on salads. It's delicious and saves calories.""<br /><b>Pass on seconds.</b> ""Those should be your leftovers.

She's also logging some serious spotlight time these days. How is it that at just shy of 30 years old, the in-demand Kristen can keep both her cool and sense of humor intact? In a brief interview with WomenHealthMag.com she explains: Don't take anything too seriously, especially yoga. <br /><br /><b>Has yoga helped you make it in Hollywood?</b><br />JoAnna [Kristin's yoga teacher] used to tell me, ""If you have to make a hard decision, stand on your head for a minute first."" It sounds silly, but it's simple science that more blood in your brain could help you think more clearly. And I believe it does.<br /><br /><b>Does yoga open you up to being a more creative actor?</b><br />I think it does. With all the hurt, embarrassment, and rejection in life, our bodies and minds try to shut down. We hunch forward, we get snappy. We have to fight that inclination. If you are good to your body, your body will be good to you!<br /><br /><b>Finding a yoga teacher is like blind dating. Why is JoAnna, a comedienne and actress as well, a good fit for you?</b><br />JoAnna helps me get the most out of each class because she knows I am sometimes intimidated by the silence of a class and the pressure to meditate and feel spiritual. I think if that is the yoga you want, wonderful--but I find that the more I pressure myself to concentrate, the less I do. <br /><br />JoAnna and I have the same sense of humor so she cracks jokes to help me enjoy hard poses. And when I'm feeling like I could go deeper spiritually, she reads me and takes me there softly and with encouragement. <p></p><p><b>What character on <i>Gossip Girl</i> needs yoga most this season?</b><br />They all need yoga! Those kids are stressed. I think a yoga boot camp would knock some sense into all of them and make them a little more carefree!<br /><br /><b>What stresses you about yoga?</b><br />I hate taking it too seriously. I want to master all of the poses too. Because I am driven and because the stretches are addictive but I always laugh when I fall out of a pose. You have to because if you just get frustrated with yourself, it ruins the whole experience.<br /><br /><b>Does yoga impact your diet?</b><br />I always find that when I am practicing, I crave less junk. I think your body looks for quick fixes with sugar and salt, and when you are treating well it craves the good stuff.<br /><br />Yoga is one of the many ways Kristen is good to her body. Use this sequence, demonstrated by <i>WH</i> yoga expert <a href=""/experts/yoga"">Tara Stiles</a>, to be good to yours.</p><p><i>* Kristen's workout was created by JoAnna Ross, an accomplished yogi, dancer, and fitness instructor.

Cool and loosen with a spatula; let sit 5 minutes until hardened. Use as a salad garnish or predinner snack.</p><p><strong>Emulsify Salad Dressing</strong><br />A DIY dressing takes seconds, costs pennies, and will entice you to up your vegetable intake. And Iowa State University researchers have found that eating veggies with an oil-based dressing helps your body absorb cancer-fighting carotenoids.<br /><strong>Try this: </strong>Use the food processor to chop parsley, chives, rosemary, or other fresh herbs. Drizzle in olive oil and balsamic vinegar in a three-to-one ratio. Add Dijon mustard and honey to taste. </p><p><strong>Pulse Salmon into Homemade Burgers</strong><br />Keep a few cans of salmon on hand so you can make this quickie midweek meal that's loaded with those nutritional all-stars, omega-3 fatty acids.<br /><strong>Try this:</strong> In a food processor, combine two 15-ounce cans drained wild salmon, 2 tablespoons onion flakes, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup light mayo, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, and 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Pulse until just combined. Form patties (recipe makes six large or 12 small) and coat with additional bread crumbs. Cook in a pan with oil, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Serve on whole-grain rolls or with cocktail sauce for dipping.</p><p><strong>Liquefy Sauteed Onions for a Flavor Boost</strong><br />Use the resulting velvety sauce as a base for chicken dishes, pasta sauces, and more, says recipe writer Max Falkowitz, a columnist for <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://SeriousEats.com"">SeriousEats.com</a>. This is also a great way to sneak the heart-healthy flavonoid quercetin into your meal.<br /><strong>Try this:</strong> Saute finely diced yellow onions in canola oil (about 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil per medium onion) until well-browned and limp. Add spices, if desired. Pour into the food processor and pulse until fully blended.</p><p><strong>Make Your Own Bread Crumbs</strong><br />They'll taste fresher than the store-bought kind, and they'll also be better for you. ""It can be hard to find 100 percent whole-grain bread crumbs,"" says Michelle Dudash, R.D., an Arizona-based chef.<br /><strong>Try this:</strong> Tear a slice of bread into quarters and toss the pieces into a food processor. (Using fresh bread will give you moist crumbs that you can use to coat part-skim mozzarella cheese sticks before baking; stale bread is better suited for fine, firm, dry crumbs that will give chicken a satisfyingly crunchy coating.) Pulse until crumbly.</p><p> </p>",

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/crisis-response,Health,23,8,7,11,1,0,3,0,,5 Steps to Help You Stay Calm in a Crisis,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1101-crisis-control.jpg,"<p>From coffeemaker malfunctions to wardrobe malfunctions, life throws challenges at you on a daily basis, but you can't know how you'll respond in a true crisis until the unthinkable presents itself. For Daniel Hernandez, the 20-year-old intern to U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, day five of his new job was life-changing. The tragic shooting in the Arizona supermarket parking lot and his quick response to apply pressure to Giffords's wound demonstrated that the guy has what it takes to keep his cool under fire-both literal and political. ""I think what is sometimes surprising is how many people may rise to the occasion in a time of crisis,"" says Victoria Follette, Ph.D., a psychology professor at the University of Nevada at Reno. ""Many people at the site of the Tucson tragedy responded in a selfless manner.""<br /><br /><br /><br />But how can you know if you'll respond with the ease of Daniel Hernandez or with a panic attack? ""At times of crisis, many people respond in 'fight or flight,' which is the body's primitive response to a perceived threat or attack,"" explains Laura Streyffeler, Ph.D., a psychologist in Florida who specializes in traumatic stress. ""Often the body appears to go on 'auto-pilot.' I have found that the more prepared and balanced a person is in his or her life, the more likely he or she will be more proactive than reactive during the crisis or event."" Just like your Girl Scout troop leader taught you, always be prepared. Here are five steps for starting now.</p><p></p><p><br /><b>1. LIVE A MEANINGFUL LIFE.</b> What you did yesterday may seem irrelevant if your house is burning down, but Follette says that living your life a certain way can make a difference when push comes to shove. ""I think that some people are very clear on their values and are always living in a manner that is consistent with those valued directions,"" she says. ""That's why people don't need to think when they decide to move to protect their child from harm."" Parent or not, having a clear idea of what's really important in your life may help you act to preserve it in a critical moment.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>2. DEVISE A PLAN OF ACTION NOW.</b> ""Being prepared for a crisis, such as having a building evacuation plan, knowing first aid/CPR, or participating in fire drills, is always helpful,"" says Streyffeler. ""Having a feeling of knowing what to do when a crisis arises often gives those involved a sense of control and direction. A proactive crisis response is always better than a reactive one.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>3. BREATHE.</b> Simple as it seems, if you can forget to breathe when you're practicing Cobra on the yoga mat, you can definitely forget when you're face-to-face with one in the wild. ""During a crisis the cardiovascular and respiratory systems speed up and often go into 'overdrive',"" explains Streyffeler. ""Breathing deeply will help slow down the physical body, which allows the mental and emotional body to slow down as well.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href=""/health/breathing-exercises"">Tips and exercises for better breathing</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>4. PAT YOURSELF ON THE BACK.</b> ""Positive self-talk before and during a crisis is often helpful,"" says Streyffeler. Telling yourself how brave you are may help you believe it and overcome your fear. ""Courage is facing adversity in the face of fear,"" says Follette. ""Those who are able to allow courage to trump their fear will act more quickly, responsibly, safely, and ultimately heroically in a crisis.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>5. LIVE IN THE MOMENT.</b> ""I think the most important thing someone does in a crisis is to stay very mindful of the present situation and to focus on the most useful action in the present moment,"" says Follette. ""A crisis is not the time for what-ifs or considering a range of future consequences."" She says hospital emergency-room personnel and soldiers in combat use this technique every day. ""<a href=""/you-and-improved/meditation-locations"">Mindfulness</a> is a skill that can be improved with practice,"" she says.

Instead, reorganize the ones you know according to this guide from Craig Ballantyne, author of <i>Turbulence Training</i>.</p><p><b>If you want </b><i>A total-body warmup</i><br /><b>Try </b><i>Circuit sets</i><br /><b>What they are</b> A series of exercises (usually six) that you complete one after another without rest, though you can do up to 30 seconds of cardio (such as jumping rope) between exercises.<br /><b>How to use them </b>For a warmup, choose six moves and do them without any weight. Because a circuit stresses the entire body, it's more effective than a treadmill jog, which primes only your lower body, Ballantyne says.</p><p><b>If you want </b><i>To <a href=""/fitness/wh-workouts-for-iphone"">shape up </a>quicker and save time</i><br /><b>Try </b><i>Supersets</i><br /><b>What they are</b> Two different exercises performed one after another, sans rest. <br /><b>How to use them</b> Insert a superset anywhere in your workout. To burn the most fat, pair moves that work as many muscle groups as possible. For example, combine a chest press with a row, or a shoulder press with a deadlift. Rest for 30 to 60 seconds after you've done both moves, then repeat two or three times. To save even more time, pair noncompeting muscle groups, such as your shoulders and glutes: One muscle group can recover while the other works, so you need less rest. </p><p><b>If you want</b> <i>To have a<a href=""/fitness/at-home-workouts-0""> toned body</a> in your going-out tank </i><br /><b>Try</b> <i>Drop sets</i><br /><b>What they are</b> Three or four sets of one exercise performed without rest using less weight for each successive set. Drop sets fatigue your muscles very quickly, which gets your heart thumping big-time and fills your muscles with blood--giving you an impressive post-workout pump.<br /><b>How to use them</b> Start with a warmup of 10 reps with 50 percent of the weight you expect to use in your first set. For that, use the heaviest weight you'd use for 8 repetitions of your exercise of choice--but do as many reps as you can. Drop the weight by 10 to 20 percent and go again. Continue to reduce the weight and repeat the move, always trying to complete the same number of reps (even though you won't be able to), until your muscles fail. Warning: A body-builder fave, drop sets are pretty hardcore, so use them only as an occasional last-minute buff-up. Stick to the other two approaches for shedding inches.</p>",
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/period-info,Health,9,8,0,9,0,0,0,0,,What's a Normal Period?,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0812-periods-normal.jpg,"<p><b>Common period questions:</b></p><p> <br /><b>1. I don't have a normal period. Every so often, I don't get my period--and I'm not pregnant. Is that normal?</b><br />Don't fret if your <a href=""/health/make-the-most-of-your-menstrual-period"">cycle</a> isn't constant all the time. ""Many women skip at least one period a year,"" says Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale University School of Medicine. ""It just means you didn't ovulate that month."" The likeliest reason: stress, which can interfere with the release of hormones that trigger ovulation.</p><p>But if you don't get your period between now and spring break--and you're definitely not knocked up--see your <a href=""/health/the-top-doctors-in-america"">doctor</a>, Minkin says. ""Conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome [a hormone imbalance marked by the overproduction of testosterone] or a thyroid disorder can interrupt ovulation."" If you're trying to get pregnant, your doc can give you a drug that will stimulate your ovaries.</p><p><b>2. I always get diarrhea right before my period. Am I normal?</b><br />Ah, the other flow. As common as it is gross, premenstrual diarrhea can be blamed on prostaglandin, a chemical released during your period. ""It contracts the walls of your uterus [that explains the <a href=""/health/pms-relief"">cramps</a>] as well as your intestines,"" Minkin says. ""Some people make more prostaglandin, while others are just more sensitive to it."" But there is a cure: Pop a couple of ibuprofen a day or two before your period starts. ""The drug interferes with the body's production of the chemical,"" Minkin says.</p><p><b>3. Some days, my flow is so heavy that I bleed through a tampon--and my jeans. Am I normal? </b><br />If you witness a scene straight out of CSI once a year or so, it's nothing to worry about, Minkin says. But if it's happening several months in a row, a 10-gallon flow could be a sign of endometriosis (when the uterine lining grows out into the pelvic cavity) or fibroids, muscular tumors that grow on the walls of the uterus. Both conditions can cause <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/infertility-symptoms-and-basic-information"">infertility</a> if left untreated, so have your ob-gyn check it out. She'll likely order an ultrasound, plus a blood test to be sure you're not at risk for anemia. Birth control pills can offer relief, but in severe cases, your doc may prescribe surgery to alter the lining of the uterus or to cut off blood flow to tumors.</p><p><b>4. I spot between periods. Is this normal?</b></p><p>Analyze the spotting. We're not talking a Rorschach test--just note when and how much you're bleeding. ""Normal spotting occurs midcycle and lasts for about a day,"" says Loren Frankel, M.D., of Palmetto Women's Health in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. But if you're essentially getting a second period every month or if the bleeding comes with severe cramps, you could have ovarian cysts. An ultrasound can help your doctor diagnose the problem. Cysts often go away on their own, but in some cases surgery is required to remove them.</p><p><b></b></p>",
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/stop-wasting-money,Life,0,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,,Save Money: Avoid These Sneaky Money Suckers,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0910-handbag-chain.jpg,"<p>We've all heard it a thousand times: If you're trying to tighten your financial belt, cut back on Starbucks runs. But what if you just loooove Starbucks? What if it's a caffeinated oasis in your crazy, full-throttle life? Instead of dropping something that's meaningful to you, how about ferreting out the real <a target=""_self"" href=""/life/career-center/are-you-wasting-your-money"">money</a> suckers-those small purchases that contribute little to your quality of life but subtract a whole lotta cash from your bank account? Use these <a href=""/life/easy-work-tips"">money saving tips</a> to do some smart trimming and you can <a href=""/life/budget-beauty-and-fitness-tips"">save</a> yourself thousands of bucks a year without missing a thing. </p><p><b>Dry Cleaning</b><br /><i>Cut $25 a month x 12 months=$300</i><br />The cost of wearing nice clothes doesn't end at the cash register. It's the upkeep of those gorgeous things that takes you to the cleaners-literally and figuratively. So here's how to look freshly pressed without spending a ton of dough.</p><p><b>Shop around.</b> The cost of dry-cleaning a blouse, for example, can range anywhere from $1.50 to $7, depending on where you go-so comparison shop to make sure you're getting the best deal possible. While you're at it, ask each cleaner for a full price list to make sure you're being treated fairly. For instance, some places charge more to clean women's shirts than they do to clean men's shirts. ""A reputable cleaner should have a gender-neutral pricing policy,"" says Lara Hollenczer, a spokesperson with the Laundry and Drycleaning Institute. If they don't, demand the lower price, and take your shirts elsewhere if they don't concede. </p><p><b>Get steamed</b>. Home dry-cleaning products, such as a $12 kit of Dryel (which uses the heat from your dryer to steam clean your clothes), can help you get a fresh-pressed look at a lower price. ""It really works,"" says Lilliana Vazquez, founder of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.cheapchicas.com"">cheapchicas.com</a>. While it won't completely replace dry cleaning, you can probably alternate between home cleaning and sending it out. But keep in mind that some items-suits and wool sweaters in particular-aren't meant to be cleaned frequently. ""Any more than two times a year and you'll wear out the fabric,"" says Kathryn Finney, founder of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.thebudgetfashionista.com"">thebudgetfashionista.com</a>.</p><p><b>Food Shopping </b><br /><i>Cut $30 a week x 52 weeks=$1,560 </i><br />You don't have to live on soup to save money on groceries. ""Take a strategic approach to shopping and you'll save a lot of money without having to eat poorly,"" says Stephanie Nelson, founder of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.couponmom.com"">couponmom.com</a>.</p><p><b>Plan ahead. </b>If you stop at the supermarket every night on the way home from work, you're wasting a lot of extra cash. A study found that people who take numerous quick trips buy 54 percent more food than those who carefully plan a once-a-week attack. A smarter move: Come up with a week's worth of meals, then shop on the weekend for only what's on the list. To speed up your planning, build a grocery list online (check out <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.grocerywiz.com"">grocerywiz.com</a>, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.knotler.com"">knotler.com</a>, and <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ziplist.com"">ziplist.com</a>).</p><p><b>Go no-name. </b>""Today, many generics or store brands taste great and run about 25 percent less than their big-name counterparts,"" says Jim Hertel of the market research firm Willard Bishop, which specializes in the grocery industry. But you don't have to go completely off-label-just experiment and see what you can live with. Rice, pasta, and cereals are less likely to have noticeable differences in flavor or texture than, say, a spicy tomato sauce or peanut butter. </p><p></p><p><b>Eating Out </b><br /><i>$30 x 24 times a year=$720 </i><br />Going to restaurants is usually the first victim of the cost-cutting guillotine. But with the right strategies, you don't need to be a slave to your stove. </p><p><b>Buy gift certificates on the cheap.</b> Websites like <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.restaurant.com"">restaurant.com</a> offer them well below face value. Type in your zip code and you'll find a list of nearby participating restaurants that offer $25 certificates for $10. (Sometimes they have killer 80 percent off sales, so you can get a $25 one for only $2.) Done twice a month, you can pocket several hundred dollars over the course of a year. </p><p><b>Set up a schedule. </b>As with food shopping, you should have a plan of attack for dining out. Instead of buying another $10 salad at lunch or hitting a casual dining spot after work because you're not in the mood to make dinner, sit down each week and figure out what dishes and what places you really want to enjoy. Then find out when you can get a great deal-such as early dinner specials or lunch, says Roxanne Webber, associate editor at <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.chow.com"">chow.com</a>. And carve out time in your schedule to pack a lunch or cook at home-it saves a ton of cash. </p><p><b></b><br /></p><p><b>Insurance and Financial Fees</b><br /><br /><i>Save almost $600 a year </i><br />Some credit cards sock you with fees of $30-plus, the FDIC reports, if you're even a day late with your payment. Say you have a bad math week and bounce a check-that's a fortune right there. Stay on top of these painful fees and save yourself from spending money that does nothing for you. </p><p><b>Set up an overdraft account.</b> ""Link your checking account to your savings account, so that if you overdraw, the money comes from savings, says Luke Reynolds, head of the FDIC's community outreach efforts. Just make sure you always have a $300 cushion in your account. </p><p><b>Set up automatic withdrawal. </b>Avoid late fees on your card by having your card issuer automatically withdraw the minimum amount before your due date. Many issuers also let you pay by phone. This helps during those months when you realize the due date is...today.</p><p><b>Don't pay for credit reports. </b>You know those ads promising free credit reports? Despite the catchy tune, the reports really aren't free, notes Reynolds-they can cost about $15 per month. For a truly free report, head to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.annualcreditreport.com"">AnnualCreditReport.com</a>. You can get one free credit report each year; for most people, that's plenty, he adds.</p><p><b>Cut ATM fees. </b>Sure, having an ATM on every corner is convenient. But it's also pricey, if you go outside your own bank's network. Some ATMs charge $2-to-$3 per transaction. Your own bank may take on another couple bucks. If you use these once a month, that's $60 out the window by next year. To avoid the fees, head to your bank's website, and find the branches and ATMs near your usual stomping grounds. Make a point of using these whenever possible. What if you're away from home and need cash? Use stores as your ATM-pay with your debit card and then ask for extra cash back when you check out, Reynolds suggests. Many times they do this without changing any fees.</p><p><b>Raise your deductible.</b> The average annual bill for homeowner's insurance was $804 in 2006, according to the Insurance Information Institute. However, by raising your deductible from $500 to $1,000, you could save up to 25 percent on your premium, the Institute says. If your annual tab is about the average, that works out to $200 per year. Same with car insurance: Kick it up from $250 to $500 and you'll save between $171 and $257 per year, says Sam Belden, vice president with Insurance.com.</p><p><b>Revisit your policy.</b> If you've changed jobs, for instance, and drive less to work, you may be able to reduce your car insurance rate.Low mileage rates, which can save you five to 15 percent, typically come into play if you drive less than about 7,500 miles each year, Belden says. </p><p></p><p><b></b></p>",

Watch <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> and <b>*feel sorry for myself;</b> I used to mock this show; now I watch it willingly. Do my interns have more fun than I do? Or is sober, adult life just inherently less interesting? <br /><b><br />10:30 p.m. </b>Husband comes home. He's being silly and it makes me laugh. I forget I was feeling old. We make out on the couch.</p><p><b><br />PC:</b> Don't whine about being dissatisfied; do something. She's in charge of how she feels as a married person--and as we get older, we sometimes need to redefine for ourselves what fun and interesting mean. </p><p><b>THE DETERMINED SINGLE </b><br />Age 34, photographer, Los Angeles</p><p><b><br />DAY ONE</b><br /><b><br />8 a.m. </b>Fly to Hawaii for much-needed vacay. Note boyfriend has emptied *the contents of several Trojan Magnum XL condom boxes into top pocket of carry-on. <br /><b><br />1 p.m.</b> Arrive in Kauai, drive to condo. Promptly have ""we just started our holiday"" sex. Standard missionary. <br /><b><br />3 p.m.</b> On lanai with a couple of cold beers and geckos. Boyfriend gets horny again. I love how reliable he is. <br /><b><br />3:05 p.m. </b>Go back inside and have more sex. This time realize that people are walking along path near bedroom window. <b>*Surprisingly hot in a risqué, sex-in-a-public-place kind of way. </b><br /><b><br />11 p.m.</b> Give BF conciliatory hand job and call it a night. </p><p><b><br />DM: </b>All those condoms might make her feel pressured to have a lot of sex. That takes the fun and spontaneity out of it. She should have sex because she wants to, not because it's expected. </p><p><b><br />SH: </b>The excitement of arriving somewhere new probably triggered a flood of dopamine that made her more willing to push her boundaries. </p><p><b><br />DAY TWO</b><br /><b><br />7 a.m. </b>Sleepy sex. My favorite. Fall back asleep. <br /><b><br />1 p.m.</b> Watch young couple getting married on beach. Wonder if it will last. <br /><b><br />3 p.m.</b> Back to condo for nap. BF points out atypical wall of mirrors in otherwise non­descript living room. Speculate that condo owners may secretly be swingers. <br /><b><br />9 p.m.</b> BF starts to <b>*undress me in living room, but I recoil</b>--what if someone sees? Somehow not the same as yesterday afternoon's hot public-sex moment. Retreat to bedroom to continue in private. </p><p><b><br />SH: </b>The dopamine rush has worn off, so she feels more reserved. </p><p><b><br />DAY THREE</b><br /><b><br />7 p.m.</b> BF grills mahimahi back at condo. I like the macho BBQ thing in him. <br /><b><br />9 p.m. *Sloppy, pinot-fueled standing sex in front of living room mirrors. </b>BF proud the swinger mirror wall has not gone to waste. Me, I'm proud that two years in, our sex life is still unpredictably hot, especially since he's got more than 10 years on me! </p><p><b><br />PS: </b>It's good to be sloppy! Get over the need to look pretty during sex. It's not cinematography. It's real life! </p><p><b><br />DAY FOUR</b><br /><b><br />2 p.m. </b>Throw back out while swimming. Retreat to condo. <br /><b><br />3:45 p.m. </b>Make formal announcement to BF that debilitating back pain prohibits any sex in foreseeable future. He suggests I see a local chiropractor. I refuse. <br /><b><br />9:30 p.m. </b>Take Advil, curl up in bed. Fall asleep <b>*snuggling. </b></p><p><b>DH: </b>As fun as sex can be, it's good to sometimes forget about performance and orgasms and just be physically affectionate. Cuddling shows someone you care about them deeply. </p><p><b><br />DAY FIVE</b><br /><b><br />9:30 a.m.</b> Back still not better. Really hurts. <br /><b><br />4:30 p.m.</b> Post-beach shower back at condo. BF goes down on me. I love the way it's all about me. <br /><b><br />11 p.m.</b> Take more Advil for back. <b>*Secretly start to feel like I'm not keeping my part of the ""bargain""</b>--we used his miles to pay for trip and now I can't even put out. Cut my losses and help him masturbate next to me. </p><p><b><br />DAY SIX</b><br /><b><br />9:15 a.m. </b>BF semi-jokingly asks if I am aware that it is day 5 of our holiday and he has yet to get a single blow job. <br /><b><br />9:17 a.m. </b>Go down on him enthusiastically. <b>*This makes both of us...happy. </b><br /><b><br />3 p.m. </b>Helicopter tour of island. Baby crying in back seat of chopper makes me happy I don't have one. <br /><b><br />6 p.m.</b> Cute kids in condo pool make me wish I did. <br /><b><br />9:45 p.m. </b>Back hurts but have sex anyway. I was missing the real deal as much as he was. Missionary only viable orthopedic option. Still, not bad. </p><p><b><br />PS: </b>He wanted a blow job, so she gave him one. Nothing wrong with that, as long as she did it and enjoyed it because she loves him and likes to make him feel good. </p><p><b><br />DAY SEVEN</b><br /><b><br />10:45 a.m. </b>So sad we have to leave. Start packing. <br /><b><br />11 a.m. </b>BF buys new boxes of chocolate-covered macadamia nuts because I pilfered the box earmarked as gift for his mom. Oops. Looks like there's no time for sex before noon checkout. Double oops. <br /><b><br />5:30 p.m.</b> Cocktails and snacks at beachfront restaurant. <b>*BF takes surreptitious snapshots down my low-cut top.</b> A modern form of flattery--I love it. <br /><b><br />7:45 p.m. </b>Red-eye home. Pop an Ambien, call it a night. </p><p><b>DM:</b> It's sad that she feels she has to put out because her boyfriend paid for the vacation. Life happens, and he should be mature enough to handle it. A tit-for-tat relationship creates resentment and pressure. </p><p><b><br />PS: </b>He's being playful, admiring, and sexy. And if he looks good in his jeans, ogle him back. Guys need ego-boosts too. </p><p><i><br />Experts have not interviewed, diagnosed, or treated an

Both the cold air of winter and sub-zero air conditioning in summer can bring on ""a minor, asthma-type reaction by constricting or narrowing the lungs, which makes breathing difficult,"" says Baxter Bell, M.D., who uses both yoga and Western medicine in his practice.

In yoga it's called <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/reclining-bound-angle-pose""><strong>reclining bound angle pose</strong></a>, his presciption for a congested chest. He says in 10 to 15 minutes, you'll not only be breathing easier, but you may notice other immediate results, like less coughing as your chest opens up. Plus, this is what yoga types call a restorative' pose, meaning it doesn't take a ton of energy to do-so you can easily pull this off even if you're as down as a dog.<br /><br /></p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/reclining-bound-angle-pose""><strong>Reclining bound angle pose<br />(supta baddha konasana)</strong></a><strong></strong><br /><br />Sit on the floor and lay a bolster or long pillow lengthwise (parallel to your spine) behind you. Bend your knees and touch the soles of your feet together, letting your legs fall out to the sides. Lie back, so your lower back, upper back, and head are supported by the bolster. You'll feel your chest begin to open up with the stretch. Rest your arms at your sides, with forearms and elbows against the floor, palms facing up. Legs are still bent with feet together. Stay in this position 10 to 15 minutes, breathing normally.</p><p></p>","Fix It,Best Yoga For..."

Often, theyll use these last few tricks to make their bodies look their best. Heres the noncolonic plan for instant ways to enhance your appearance: <br /><br /><b>Pump Fast</b><br /><br />Trainer Gunnar Peterson suggests doing a quick <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/weight-training-tips"">strength workout</a> before hitting the beach. Do moves that tax your whole body. <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/pushup-1"">Pushups</a> and <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/overhead-squat-0"">squats</a> are great choices. But increase your reps and speed up your pace to force blood into your muscles, he says. Decrease the weight so that you can do sets of 15 reps. The more blood you have in your muscles, the more toned you'll look, Peterson says.<br /><br /><b>Drink Lots</b><br /><br />Guzzling a few <a href=""http://origin.www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/drink-water-to-lose-more-weight"">glasses of water</a> before hitting the beach will help flush your system and relieve bloating.<br /><br /><b>Add Shade</b><br /><br />You may have used self-tanner before to minimize the appearance of <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/yoga/yoga-poses-to-smooth-cellulite"">cellulite</a>, but now that youre training, use it to enhance the look of your muscles. Color makes your muscle definition pop because it brings out the shadows, Peterson says.<br /><br /><b>Know Your Bloat Foods</b><br /><br />Avoid beans, for example, if they're hard for you to digest or make you bloat, says Ann Yelmokas McDermott, Ph.D., of Tufts University. Dairy has the same effect for some. And most important, minimize your sodium intake. Most Americans consume 5,500 milligrams of salt each day. While there's no Recommended Dietary Allowance, most nutritionists suggest you stay under 2,500 or 3,000 mg. Dr. McDermott recommends keeping your intake under 3,000 mg per day to avoid bloating. <br />","Getting Started,Work It Off"

And if it's this difficult now, imagine what it's going to be like in 10, 20, 30 years. But before you begin planning your future as a wobbly, overweight hunchback, understand that getting in the shape of your life for the rest of your life doesn't have to be daunting.<br /><br />In fact, if you find your fitness workout groove now, you'll set yourself up for success in the future. Studies show that working out may lower a woman's risk of <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/surviving-breast-cancer"">breast cancer</a> by 37 percent, osteoporosis by 45 percent, and <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/heart-health-3"">heart disease</a> by 14 percent. So we tapped dozens of doctors and fitness experts to find out exactly what you should do to add years to your life.<br /><br />The bottom line: Whether you're fresh out of college or funding Junior's tuition, the moment to launch your lifetime fitness plan is now. Then simply adjust your total-body workouts throughout the years to give your muscles, bones, and heart what they need to keep working well enough to keep up with you.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/keep-your-back-healthy""><b>RELATED: The Best Workout for Your 20s!</b></a></p><p><strong>Fate Says: Nice Bones! </strong><br /> Bone mass in your hips and spine peaks in your mid to late 20s, says Kara Witzke, Ph.D., associate professor of kinesiology at California State University in San Marcos. Build as much bone as possible now and you'll have some to spare later, lowering your chances of osteoporosis.<br /><br /><strong>Cheat Fate: Bend, Lift, and Jump</strong><br />""Bones are like muscles; they get stronger at the specific region that's stressed,"" says Ana Gomez, Ph.D., an exercise and diet researcher at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. The best bone-building workouts are weight-bearing activities like hiking and running and upper- and lower-body strength training like squats, lunges, rows, and presses.<br /><br />Try trading a cup of coffee every morning for another kind of jolt. Jumping 50 times on one leg and then 50 hops on the other, and you could reduce your risk of hip fracture later in life, Dr. Witzke says. Studies show that weight-bearing impact activities minimize age-related bone loss, especially in your hips.</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/?keycode=197495&cm_mmc=whcom-_-edit-_-lookbetternaked""></a></p><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/?keycode=197495&cm_mmc=whcom-_-edit-_-lookbetternaked""><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/health-guides/images/book-offer.jpg"" /><br /><br /></a><p></p><p> </p><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/health-guides/images/dose-signup.gif"" /><br /><br />        <p> </p><p><br /></p><p><strong> Fate Says: You're Weak in the Knees</strong><br />According to the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, women are most likely to sustain sports-related injuries between the ages of 15 and 25. And the knees are prime targets. That's partly because your hips widen slightly in your late teens. As a result, your thigh bones meet your shins at the knee joints at an increased angle, pushing your kneecaps off center, says Letha Griffin, Ph.D., team physician for Georgia State University athletics.<br /><br /><strong>Cheat Fate: Build 'em Up </strong><br />To strengthen the muscles around your knees-especially your inner thighs-try lying leg circles. Lie on your left side with your head, shoulders, and hips aligned. Prop your head up with your left hand and place your right palm on the floor in front of your belly button. Bend your right knee and place your right foot on the floor in front of your left knee. Lift your left leg 8 inches (or more if you can) off the floor. With your leg straight and toes flexed, draw 12 circles in the air with your left heel. Lower your leg and switch sides. That's one rep; do three. <br /><br /><strong>Fate Says: You Have A Hunch </strong><br />Spending 40 or more hours a week crouched over your keyboard like a human comma probably impresses your boss, but it also compresses your spine. ""That leads to slumped posture in the short term and irreversible damage to your spine over the years,"" says Lori Incledon, author of <em>Strength Training for Women</em>. ""When your spine is held in the same posture for years, the muscles become too deconditioned to move the bones, and the bones begin to fuse together."" Act now and you'll be a head above the other women on your over-50 basketball team-not to mention less prone to upper-back and neck pain.<br /><br /><strong>Cheat Fate: Stretch Tall</strong><br /> Do the foam roller snow angel every day. Lie back along a 3-foot foam roller so that it runs the length of your spine. Bend your knees and rest your feet flat on the floor. Place your hands next to your hips, palms up, with your arms straight.

Ensure that those closest to you tip the scale in your favor by following these simple guidelines.</p><p><strong>Your BFF</strong><br />A study in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em> found that your friends may increase your odds of gaining weight by 57 percent. ""Women tend to match each other's behavior at the table,"" says Atlanta nutritionist Marisa Moore, R.D. Let your pal order first-she'll feel pressure to set a good example, and you'll likely follow her lead. And don't invite your whole clique- a recent study in the journal Appetite found that ladies who lunched with four friends averaged 150 calories more per meal than those who dined with three.</p><p><strong>Your Dog</strong><br />Walking your pooch will shrink your paunch. In a study at the University of Missouri-Columbia, volunteers who got 30 minutes of leash time five times a week dropped an average of 14 pounds in a year. On bad-weather days, play indoor games, like chasing your dog up and down the stairs, to help burn up his energy and your lunchtime burrito, suggests Robert Kushner, M.D., coauthor of <em>Fitness Unleashed! A Dog andOwner's Guide to Losing Weight and Gaining Health Together</em>.</p><p><strong>Your Guy</strong><br />Researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that women who live with a romantic partner increase their risk of becoming obese by 63 percent, and those who marry more than double it. But couples also have an easier time taking weight off: Duke University researchers discovered that people were 50 percent more likely to start exercising if their partner joined them. Get your guy to work up a sweat with you by bike riding, running, or ice skating. And have him help out on the food front by cooking together at home. An FDA report found that eating out more than five times a week (which couples have been known to do) adds about 290 calories on average to your daily diet-that's the equivalent of 30 pounds a year!</p><p><strong>Your Coworkers</strong><br />A study in <em>Eating Behaviors</em> found that when female coworkers teamed up to lose weight, they were more likely to exercise and dropped more pounds early on. Ask your workplace to start an official fitness-incentive program. Studies have shown that they encourage employees to set and meet weekly fitness goals while also increasing productivity. Or kick off your own <em>Biggest Loser</em>-style competition complete with weigh-ins and lunch-hour challenges like power walks, spin classes, or yoga sessions.</p>","tech,lose weight"
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/preventing-bedbugs,Health,2,8,2,16,8,1,4,0,,Don't Let the Bedbugs Bite,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1101-bed-bugs-main.jpg,"<p>The number of bedbug calls to pest-control companies is up a whopping 500 percent, and the little bloodsuckers are infiltrating hotels nationwide. Avoid an itchy run-in by conducting a <em>CSI</em>-like investigation of your room before you get settled. The best defense against these creepy crawlers is a good offense.</p><p><strong>BED</strong><br />Bedbugs have marched into shops, movie theaters, offices, and even opera houses, but their favorite breeding ground remains their namesake. As soon as you enter your hotel room (don't sprawl out on that plush bed just yet) inspect the sheets, mattress, and box spring, especially around the seams. You're looking for old skins (bedbugs shed papery layers that look like popcorn-kernel shells), black spots (bedbug poop), or the live insects themselves. If possible, stick your head under the bed and shine a flashlight on the bottom of the box spring.</p><p>One thing to know: An infested room can sometimes have a scent similar to coriander; bedbugs release a pheromone that can smell like the pungent herb, says Susan Jones, Ph.D., an associate professor of entomology at Ohio State University.</p><p><strong>COUCH AND CURTAINS</strong><br />Bedbugs love to hide in upholstered furniture. Wood chairs may be safer, but be wary of those with visible cracks. The critters can fit into any space that a credit card can be slipped into, says Jody Gangloff-Kaufmann, Ph.D., an entomologist at Cornell University. Pay particular attention to the seams as you carefully look between and beneath all cushions for bugs, empty skins, or feces. (Never pick up a ""free"" sofa you find on the street-it may be teeming with the little suckers!)</p><p><strong>BASEBOARDS </strong><br />Close quarters in big cities like New York, Detroit, Denver, and Los Angeles mean more bedbugs for all: The creatures can easily crawl from one apartment or hotel room to the next. Baseboards are a possible entry point, so get down low and investigate the crevices between the baseboard and the wall, and the baseboard and the carpet, as well as around electrical outlets.</p><p><strong>PICTURE FRAMES</strong><br />When it comes to art, these parasites don't discriminate--they've been found around elegant oil paintings in expensive hotels and cheesy prints in seedy motels. If any art is hanging in your room, examine the frame closely and peer behind it for telltale signs.</p><p><strong>HEADBOARD</strong><br />These nocturnal beings thrive in dark, dry areas (they're afraid of direct sunlight). Whip out a credit card and run the edge of it along every accessible surface of the headboard, paying special attention to any seams or cracks, says Andy Linares, president of Bug Off Pest Control Center in New York City. If you dislodge any bugs or bug debris, you know your room has been compromised, so hightail it out of there.</p><p><strong>SUITCASE</strong><br />Body heat is a bedbug magnet, and the pests have two hooklike claws on each of their six legs that allow them to hitch a ride on your clothes, says entomologist Jeffrey White. Never set your luggage on a hotel bed or floor; instead, give the suitcase rack a onceover before setting your bag on it as far from the bed as possible (it's best not to put it against a wall either). But don't unzip anything until you've checked out the rest of the room. Applying Rest Easy Bedbug luggage spray ($15, <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://bedbugcentral.com"">bedbugcentral.com</a>) to the outside and inside lining of your bags before traveling may keep bedbugs away, but the product hasn't been scientifically proven to work, so just consider it a possible layer of protection.</p><p><strong>DRESSER</strong><br />The safest place for your luggage? The bathtub. If that sounds too crazy, hang your clothes in the closet or leave them in your suitcase on the luggage rack after you've inspected it. Avoid using the dresser drawers, which are harder to inspect, says entomologist Dini Miller, Ph.D., of Virginia Tech University.</p><p><strong>The Bug</strong></p><strong><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/2014/03/17/bed-bug_0.jpg"" /><br /><br /></strong><strong>Patrick Morgan</strong><p><br />The flat, reddish-brown pests measure three-sixteenths of an inch long-about the size of an apple seed. Females can lay up to five barely visible eggs a day (which they then glue in place, so the eggs can stick to mattresses, headboards, and suitcases, among other things). The resulting straw-colored babies thrive in 70°F to 80°F environments and reach maturity in about 30 to 45 days, provided they're well nourished...by human blood. Bedbugs can survive unfed for six months or more, sometimes much longer, depending on their living conditions, says Jeffrey White, an entomologist with BedBug Central in New Jersey. And you can't avoid them by being superclean: Unlike roaches or ants, bedbugs are not seduced by filth or food.</p><p><strong>The Bite</strong><br />Bedbugs' saliva contains a built-in anesthetic, so when they feed on you-repeatedly, for up to 10 minutes at a time-you typically won't feel anything. Some people don't have any reaction to the bites, but about 70 percent do, mostly in the form of red, itchy bumps, says White. Those bumps will often appear all in a row, a phenomenon some victims refer to as ""breakfast, lunch, and dinner.""</p><p><strong>What to Do If You Find One</strong><br /><strong>1/</strong> Request an immediate room swap. Just because your room has bugs doesn't mean the entire hotel has been hit. Ask to be moved to a different floor, and then scrutinize your new digs. If you've been in your room for a few hours before you spot an insect, run a hot iron over the outside of your suitcase before you bolt, says pest-control expert Andy Linares. Or request that the hotel steam clean all of your stuff, adds Susan Jones, Ph.D. Preventive strategy: Before you book a room, go to bedbugregistry.com, which tracks bedbug reports at hotels. But keep in mind that the site isn't checked for accuracy.</p><p><strong>2/</strong> Protect your stuff. Put all the clothing you brought on the trip into a plastic trash bag in your suitcase, then empty it into the clothes dryer when you get home. Thirty minutes of 120°F heat will annihilate any pests. Or get some dissolvable laundry bags (try GreenClean, $30 for 10, <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://amazon.com"">amazon.com</a>). Before you check out, seal your clothes into the sacks and pack them in your suitcase. Once home, toss the water-soluble bags into the washing machine, then hot-dry your clothes, says entomologist Jeffrey White.</p><p><strong>3/</strong> Don't drag your suitcase over your threshold. Buy high-power pesticide strips (Nuvan Prostrips, $50 for 12, <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://amazon.com"">amazon.com</a>) and drop them into a large trash bag along with your luggage. Leave it tied up tight for at least two weeks (preferably outside) to kill off any hitchhiking critters, says White. Really paranoid? Invest in a PackTite Portable Heating Unit ($320, <a target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://bedbugcentral.com"">bedbugcentral.com</a>). It's like a duffel bag with a grill at the bottom, and it kills bedbugs on items you can't launder, like your suitcase or dry-clean-only clothes.</p>",travel

And she's pissed. </b>Some people might call her a bitch, this woman who threatens to erupt through my pores, fierce and flailing like Russell Crowe on a rampage in a New York hotel room, when the guy in front of me in line at the grocery store is paying with pennies that he's pulling out of his pocket one by one. Or when I happen to spot the 3-year-old at daycare ripping <i>Guess How Much I Love You </i>out of my daughter's tiny, innocent hands. Or when my husband runs out to Home Depot for a light bulb and returns three hours later because he ""took a quick spin through Best Buy."" Or when, just last week, after waiting roughly 22 years at a stop sign, I finally caught a hole in the traffic, zipped out to make a left turn, and realized that a beige car--that had to be going at least 20 miles per hour over the speed limit--was bearing down fast on my rear bumper. The driver crushed on his brakes mere inches from my minivan, and then rammed his horn as if I'd just told him his mother was not only ugly but also fat. </p><p>At that point, I had a choice to make. </p><p>Because she was coming. I could feel her igniting in my chest, boiling up my throat, fueled by the man in the beige car and his crazy eyes that, I could see in my rearview mirror, were shooting voodoo rays at the back of my head. I could have wrestled her down. I could have taken a deep breath...or two...or 20...and tempered her fury, calmed her impulse to kill, eased her back down to wherever it is that she waits, like a Doberman, frothing. I could have pressed the pedal and driven off, telling myself that this was the sensible thing to do.</p><p><br />Unfortunately for Mr. Crazy Eyes, I didn't think that was the sensible thing to do. Instead, I released her and all her venom, and she did exactly what she always does in situations like this: She slowed the minivan down to two miles an hour, forcing him to a crawl, and roared, out loud, something along the lines of ""How do you like that?! Mwa-ha-ha-ha! <i>Mwa-ha-ha-ha!!!"" </i></p><p>""Yes, honey, I know,"" I conceded to my husband later that night, after I regaled him with my <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/traveling-with-your-man"">road rage</a> story of the day. ""I know this behavior is unhealthy. And nasty. And entirely dangerous for everyone involved. Yes, dear...sweetums...love of my loins...I'm well aware that people have been shot over forgetting turn signals and such things. I understand."" </p><p>But what he doesn't understand is this: There really is a pissed-off woman living inside me. Festering. Rumbling. Ravenous for something to catch me off guard so she can surface, claws out, to protect me. And if I didn't let her loose every now and then, the next time my husband lies down on the couch in front of <i>Jeopardy! </i>while I wash the dishes from the dinner I just cooked, I might have a harder time choosing to control her. I might actually encourage her to rise up and open a can of Linda Blair all over him. Or on the poor man in front of me in the grocery line. Or, God forbid, on the little 3-year-old at daycare. My husband doesn't understand how good my road rage is for him and for our marriage and for mankind at large, how letting out my demons while insulated in a locked metal box that's not only soundproof but also able to spirit me away so I never again have to see the person I just flipped off six times actually keeps me sane. Actually pacifies my inner bitch. Actually leaves my rage out there, somewhere, on the road.</p>",Woman to Woman

""Kids dawdle in the morning, because they realize that they will not see their parents until the end of the day,"" says Aletha Solter, Ph.D., a developmental psychologist and author of <i>Helping Young Children Flourish</i>. ""When children get some undivided 'Mommy-time' in the morning, even if it's only 10 minutes, they're much more likely to cooperate."" Do that and your child will be more inclined to get dressed, <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/breakfast-foods-and-weight-loss"">eat breakfast</a>, and follow directions, Dr. Solter says.<br /><br /><b>If you need to walk <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/you-and-improved/buying-a-pet"">your dog</a>...</b><br /><br />Begging Rover to squat won't get you into the shower any sooner.

Several studies have shown that not only will it boost your energy, but it acts as a great poo-motivator for your dog. Afterward, walk around the block for 5 to 10 minutes. ""Dogs can learn to hold their bowel movements because that means they'll get to walk outside longer,"" says Andrew Luescher, D.V.M., Ph.D., director at the Animal Behavior Clinic at Purdue University. ""Taking them home right away is like punishing them for going to the bathroom.""

Instead of banishing him to the living room, test your mattress. If yours shakes like a music-video dancer every time you move, consider investing in one that conforms to your shape while remaining firm in other areas, says Russell Rosenberg, Ph.D., director of the Northside Hospital Sleep Disorders Center in Atlanta. That will decrease the chance of you feeling him get out of bed. (Dr. Rosenberg suggests a Swedish Tempur-Pedic mattress.) ""If you don't get angry or feel the pressure to get up, hopefully it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to reinitiate sleep,"" Dr. Rosenberg says.<br /><br /><b>If you slept horribly last night...</b><br /><br />Exercise, caffeine, alcohol, or heavy meals up to 3 hours before bedtime are all sleep-stoppers. If you're sleep-deprived in the morning, eat oatmeal. ""There's research that shows that people who have high-fiber, low-fat breakfasts have more energy, are more alert, and eat less until the next meal,"" says Debra Wein, R.D., a Boston nutritionist. You also may want to consider exercising in the morning. One study found that morning exercisers averaged 70 percent better sleep than evening exercisers, who may be disrupting their sleep-wake cycle by stirring up energy too close to bedtime. (If you can't face the thought of morning squats, make sure to exercise 3 to 4 hours before you go to bed.)<br /><br /><b>If you exercise...</b><br /><br />The best way to resist 20 more minutes of sack time is to rouse yourself from bed and touch your toes. ""Doing an exercise in which you bend your head down helps bring blood to your brain and wakes you up,"" says Anne Kent Rush, author of <i>The Way of Stretching</i>. Then eat a banana or an orange; your body needs the carbs before exercise. ""A piece of fruit has simple sugars and complex carbs, both of which will be digested quickly and boost your energy level,"" Wein says. Add a cup of coffee: A University of Georgia study found that the caffeine can reduce muscle pain by 25 percent, since caffeine may block the nerve receptors that transmit pain.<br /><br /><b>If you have a 1-hour commute...</b><br /><br />Driving gives you plenty of time - to dread afternoon meetings and stew about the fact that your to-do list is longer than Bo Bice's hair. So keep a cinnamon air freshener in your car. People who inhaled cinnamon or peppermint while driving saw a 20 percent decrease in anxiety, 15 percent decrease in fatigue, 25 percent decrease in frustration, and 30 percent increase in alertness, according to a recent study from Wheeling Jesuit University. ""These scents stimulate the area of the brain responsible for alertness, called the reticular activating system,"" says Bryan Raudenbush, Ph.D., study author. ""This is the part of the brain that makes us fall asleep when we're tired and wakes us up in the morning."" Sucking on peppermints or chewing Big Red alone doesn't cut it; the nasal passageway is the quickest route to the brain.<br /><br /><b>If you're trying to wean yourself off caffeine...</b><br /><br />You can cut back on withdrawal headaches as well as those teeth-whitening bills if you switch to tea. Most teas will still have plenty of what you're looking for - nearly 50 milligrams of caffeine per 8-ounce cup. Or try a tea with peppermint (to boost energy) and chamomile (to calm nerves), says Kellye Davis, author of <i>The Bliss Principle</i>. Also tap into the world's most powerful energy source: the sun. Natural light exposure first thing in the morning will help reset your internal clock, making it much easier to wake up, says Patrick O'Connor, Ph.D., a professor at the University of Georgia. Take a 10-minute walk when you get up or eat breakfast on the porch. In the case of overcast skies or winter darkness, get dressed in the brightest room in your house. Although artificial light is less effective, it will still help recharge your batteries.</p>","You and Improved,Simplify Your Life"

It wasn't just her gorgeous dress, but the size of it. The 5'10"" bride--whose plump figure had earned her the hurtful childhood nickname Whopper--was thin.</p><p>Marisa, now a 24-year-old office manager in Rancho Santa Margarita, California, hit her heaviest weight after high school. Her parents had divorced and moved away, and she was left balancing a fulltime job with night classes at a community college. ""Doing everything myself was hard. I got lazy and ate out constantly,"" she says. In three years, she put on 75 pounds, peaking at 240.<br /></p><p><b>The Change</b><br />In December 2007, Marisa's longtime boyfriend, Scott, proposed. She was ecstatic-until she went dress shopping. To her horror, she couldn't squeeze her size-24 body into any of the store samples. Her embarrassment turned to frustration, then resolve. ""I needed a change,"" she says.</p><p><b>The Lifestyle</b><br />To wean herself off fast food and other fattening fare, Marisa struck one high-calorie food from her menu every week for three months. She lost 15 pounds by March 2008 and finally had enough energy to hit the gym. She started <a target=""_blank"" href=""/fitness/running-for-weightloss"">running to lose weight</a> by logging hours on the elliptical and added Spinning classes that summer to fire up her calorie burn. By her final fitting, in October 2008, Marisa had dropped six dress sizes and was swimming in her gown! Seizing that momentum, she began strength training <a target=""_blank"" href=""/fitness/wh-workouts-for-iphone"">workouts</a> after the wedding and cracked down on snacks. By May 2009, she hit her low of 170 pounds.</p><p><b>The Reward</b><br />The only thing Marisa treasures more than her beautiful wedding photos is her new positive attitude. ""I wanted to be happy with my body so I could be happy in my marriage and my life,"" she says. ""And now I am.""</p><p><b>Marisa's Tips</b><br /><b>Multitask.</b> ""If I can't get to the gym, I'll do squats while blow-drying my hair.""</p><p><b>Recruit fruit. </b>""Berries and melon help control my sweet tooth."" <br /><b><br />Dish up diversity. </b>""I vary veggies in my salads so I'm never bored.""</p><p>Catch up on all of our <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-success-stories-11"">weight loss success</a> stories!</p>",

Why? Early spring's oscillating temps and lack of sunlight can cause a serious drop in your level of serotonin, a feel-good chemical that's found in the brain. And without enough serotonin, our mood descends into darkness or, at the very least, an unpleasant crabbiness (you know, the bad temper we typically blame on the rain). Fortunately, you can outsmart wicked weather patterns with these mood-boosting tips as you await the arrival of sunnier days.</p><p><strong>Light Up Your Life </strong><br />If a Miami mini-break isn't an option, seek out a light box. A strong one that emits at least 10,000 lux can have the same effect as basking in the early-morning sun-minus the cancer-causing UV rays. Place the light box on a table near you-you need only 30 minutes of exposure to increase your serotonin levels and leave you ""more alert and energized, two factors that contribute to a good mood,"" says Michael Terman, Ph.D., director of the Center for Light Treatment and Biological Rhythms at New York City's Columbia University Medical Center. For more info-such as where to buy a light box-visit cet.org.</p><p><strong>Devour Chocolate Daily</strong><br />It's true: One small square a day can keep the blues away. Chocolate contains a pleasure-promoting, mood-regulating neuro-transmitter called phenylethylamine, which stimulates a rush of endorphins, the same compounds released during an orgasm. Studies show that cocoa has almost twice the amount of antioxidants as red wine, so it helps lower blood pressure and wards off wrinkles. When snacking, stick to dark chocolate that's at least 70 percent cocoa-it's healthier than the milk-infused variety.</p><p><strong>Find Bliss in the Bedroom </strong><br />During foreplay, your brain gets a healthy dose of the natural chemical dopamine, which ""boosts your feelings of desire and makes you want to have sex,"" says Kimberly Flemke, Ph.D., a sex therapist at Philadelphia's Institute for Sex Therapy at the Council for Relationships. A quickie can be an uplifting double whammy. If you have an orgasm, your body will also release oxytocin, the so-called cuddle hormone that lets you feel more emotionally connected to your partner. Just one romp in the sheets will get you to your happy place.</p><p><strong>Go Fish</strong><br />People who eat foods containing omega-3 fatty acids-like salmon and tuna-have a better handle on their emotions and are more likely to be upbeat and agreeable, says Sarah Conklin, Ph.D., a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Allegheny College in Pennsylvania. The American Heart Association recommends eating two four-ounce portions of fish twice a week. But don't overdo it: Stick to one can of albacore a week to avoid mercury poisoning. Walnuts and flaxseed are also packed with the get-happy proteins, which have been proven to prevent heart disease.</p><p> </p>",

To make sure your fitness doesn't pay the price, we asked experts around the country for their best tips for landing big results in the gym--when there's no clipboard-happy trainer. Apply this know-how during your next solo session. </p><p><b>Fitness Tips:</b></p><p><b>1. DON'T BE LAZY</b><br />When you can do 12 reps of a move with perfect form for two workouts in a row, it's time to increase the amount you're lifting by five percent, says Wayne Westcott, Ph.D., author of <i>Get Stronger, Feel Younger.</i></p><p><b>2. DON'T BE LAZY, PART II</b><br />Last year, researchers at Stanford University found that people who received automated exercise reminders by phone were about as likely to go to the gym as people who had real-life trainers harassing them. Keep yourself honest by registering for prodding e-mails from <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.hassleme.co.uk"">hassleme.co.uk</a>. Plug in your e-mail address, how often you want to be nudged, and a direct order (""Get to the gym! Now! Love, Your Incredibly Skimpy Bikini"").</p><p><b>3. TAKE IT SLOW </b><br />Chances are, you're lifting too fast, says Gloria Bender, a personal trainer at Powerhouse Gym in Santa Clarita, California. Research from the South Shore YMCA in Quincy, Massachusetts, found that lifting weights slowly--10 seconds up and four seconds down--activates more muscle fibers than hoisting a weight as fast as you can. Why? When you lift too quickly, you use momentum, not muscles.</p><p><b>4. BE EFFICIENT</b><br />Trainers usually have, at most, 30 to 60 minutes with clients two to three times a week, so in order to get results they have to make the most of every workout. Crib this secret: Build interval training into your strength routine, says Rachel Cosgrove, owner of Results Fitness in Newhall, California. Hop on the treadmill or bike between sets of strength exercises and do two to three minutes of intense cardio--up the incline for resistance and go as hard as you can. Then go back to the weights. Repeat four to seven times. In 2005, researchers at McMaster University in Ontario found that 30 minutes of cardio intervals done three times a week increased aerobic capacity by almost 10 percent over two weeks.</p><p><b>5. CHECK YOURSELF OUT</b><br />Whether you're hitting your delts or your glutes, stand in front of a mirror. ""This provides instant feedback; you'll know if your form is off, which is what a trainer would tell you,"" says Carla Sottovia, Ph.D., a senior personal trainer at the Cooper Fitness Center in Dallas. Look for these common mistakes: not keeping your neck in line with your spine and letting knees jut out past your toes when doing squats. Another mirror plus: A 2001 study at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign found that seeing yourself sweat can give the boost you need to eke out another rep. </p><p>Kick-start it: Amp up your <a target=""_blank"" href=""/fitness/workouts""><b>exercise arsenal with <i>WH</i>'s workout pages</b></a>.</p>",

To keep your body guessing, focus on one variable per workout: Increase the weight but lower the number of reps one day; lower your standard weight but add a set the next; use your standard weight but do more reps faster on another.</p><p><strong>Don't give up on the pullup</strong><br />Pullups, which strengthen the lats, biceps, middle back, and shoulders, are an effective upper-body exercise. Can't squeeze one out? Hood suggests doing plank pulls: Lie with your chest under a weight bar set to knee height on a squatting rack. Grab the bar with an overhand grip and, keeping your body in one line, bend your elbows and pull your chest toward the bar. Lower back to start; do 10 reps.</p><p><strong>Row your boat</strong><br />Before you strength train, spend 10 minutes on a rowing machine to get blood flowing to all the muscles and joints in your body. ""It's better than a treadmill or a stationary bike because it engages your upper body and core, not just your legs,"" Hood says.</p><p><strong>Short-circuit your routine</strong><br />Blast fat with a circuit that includes strength training and cardio: Do a set of push-ups, jump rope for a minute, do a set of squats, jump rope again; continue to alternate strength and cardio. ""You're building muscle while keeping your heart rate high,"" Hood says.</p><p><strong>HOW TO MUCNH</strong></p><p><strong>Minimize refined carbs</strong><br />Out: most breads, cookies, chocolate, white rice, nearly every cereal, honey, and anything with corn syrup or sugar. ""As soon as you swallow a refined carb, it starts to spike your blood sugar, which produces excess insulin, a hormone that can be responsible for holding on to fat stores,"" Hood says.</p><p><strong>Eat five times a day</strong><br />That means three meals and two snacks: one between breakfast and lunch, and one between lunch and dinner. ""You'll have a steady stream of energy; plus, less food more often isn't as taxing on your digestive system as three big meals,"" explains Hood, adding that five daily feedings stabilizes your blood sugar, so you won't have crazy mood swings or hunger pangs.</p><p><strong>Up your protein</strong><br />Hood suggests a Zone-inspired diet--a balance of protein, complex carbs, and fat in every meal and snack--to protect against insulin overload. The benefit of high-quality protein, like chicken, turkey, and low-fat Greek yogurt: It contains amino acids, which help muscles recover after workouts. </p><p><strong>Limit your liquids</strong><br />Ditch juices, vanilla lattes, and sodas--all have unneeded sugar and calories. ""You drink for three reasons,"" Hood says: ""If you're thirsty, drink water. If you need stimulation, drink black coffee. If you want to take the edge off, choose a vodka martini or a similar non-mixed, simple drink. In other words, no mojitos."" </p><p><strong>Yes, that means diet soda, too</strong><br />Although the science on the fake sweeteners used in diet sodas is still undecided, Hood is against them. ""The sweeteners may elicit an insulin spike or, at the very least, psychologically prepare you for something sweet, but there are no calories to back the signal,"" he says.</p>","best tips ever,celebrity"
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/meet-laura-prepon,Life,6,7,12,9,0,5,0,0,,A Conversation with Laura Prepon,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0712-conv-lprepon-2015.jpg,"On the addictive ABC drama <i>October Road,</i> Laura Prepon plays Hannah Daniels, a single mom knocked off balance when Nick, her charming cad of a high school sweetheart, moves back to their tiny Massachusetts town. (He told her he was leaving on a six-week post-graduation trip and never returned.) As if disappearing weren't obnoxious enough, Nick has also trashed Hannah and all their friends in a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/the-most-and-least-promising-diets"">best-selling book </a>based on their lives. ""It's an interesting role,"" Prepon says, ""because it addresses what it's like to look at the choices you <i>didn't</i> make.""<br /><br />In real life, 27-year-old Prepon has few regrets. The youngest of five (she has three sisters and a brother) in a tight-knit clan in Watchung, New Jersey, she started acting at age 15, studying in New York and earning a decent living as a model before heading out to Los Angeles and, in 1998, landing her breakout role as Donna Pinciotti on Fox's <i>That '70s Show</i>. Like both Donna and Hannah, Prepon comes across as incredibly comfortable in her skin. You get the sense that she knows who she is and likes who she is -- and doesn't much care if other people don't. Some people might call that smug; we call it confident.<br /><br /><b>The crazy <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/easy-healthy-recipes"">holiday season</a> is here. What's it like being back in Jersey with such a big family?</b><br />Amazing, actually. And we have a lot of extended family. My mom's a fantastic chef, so she makes all this gourmet food. And -- now, this is going to sound kind of weird, but it's true -- we act out Meat Loaf's ""Paradise by the Dashboard Light."" It's tradition, no matter what the occasion. My aunt got married last year, and all of us were together, my entire family. I brought my boyfriend [actor Christopher Masterson] and one of my friends with me, and they were standing there, mouths agape, watching my entire clan sing Meat Loaf. All of the girls sing, ""I want to know right now! Do you love me?"" The whole deal. It's hysterical.<br /><br /><b>Why does everybody pick on Jersey?</b><br />It's weird. When I first came out to L.A., everyone would ask me where I was from, and when I told them ""<a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/chelsea-handler-interview"">New Jersey</a>,"" they'd be like, ""Oh my God, I am so sorry."" But I love it. I think a lot of times people leave [New York] and see the surrounding towns, with factories and stuff -- so they turn around and go right back into the city. But if you actually drive into New Jersey, it's absolutely beautiful. And I love the people, I love the up-frontness. In New Jersey, they come right up: ""I love your show, blah blah blah!"" In L.A., you always get the sideways glance.<br /><br /><b>You're a Scientologist. It seems there's always controversy around it. Is that hard?</b><br />Anyone who knows me is just like, ""Wow, if Laura is a Scientologist, then there has to be something to this."" When I hear something negative, I don't get defensive. I know what's true for me and what works for me.<br /><br /><b>What works for you when it comes to staying in shape and dealing with stress?</b><br />I spin and do a lot with medicine balls and bands, which is great for toning. And dancing. I love ballet; I'm also taking salsa lessons. But with my schedule, it's tough -- some mornings I have to be up at 4. But I like waking up, drinking coffee, and getting on the elliptical machine -- it shakes off the sleep fog.<br /><br /><b>Do you ever kick back and relax?</b><br />I love what I do so much that even when I have time off, I'm working on something. Right now I'm in preproduction on a music video I'm directing for Charlie Wadhams. He's on an indie label and he's a friend of mine. The video is going to be awesome: It's a take on an old-fashioned prison break, <i>Cool Hand Luke</i> kind of thing. Or I'm writing or taking a film class. That stuff to me is de-stressing because whenever I'm creating something, I'm stress-free. The other thing I love is just hanging out at my house, playing poker with my guy friends.<br /><br /><b>Why <i>are</i> so many of your friends guys?</b><br />I don't know! It's just been like that my entire life. I play poker. I'm a huge USC fan. I ride dirt bikes. So I always hung out with guys.<br /><br /><b>Do you beat all of them at poker?</b><br />Well, they named me the Red Dragon, so I guess that says something. You know, you can't name yourself in poker; your name has to evolve. I can definitely hold my own against them. I have taken their money many times.<br /><br /><b>I read that you love sneakers and vintage clothing.</b><br />Lately I've been wearing more dresses. Well, [<i>laughs</i>] not really, but kind of. My closet is so ridiculous. I live out of a pile of clothes and just grab the first clean thing I can find. I tend to wear the same jeans and a different T-shirt every day, pretty much.<br /><br /><b>Aren't you afraid <i>Us Weekly</i>'s going to snap your picture and print a caption saying, ""Laura Prepon -- she's a slob, just like us!""</b><br />If <i>Us Weekly</i> says I'm wearing the same thing, I really couldn't care less.<br /><br /><b>Who makes the jeans you love so much?</b><br />I have this pair of Fidelity jeans that are this relaxed kind of trouser, but they don't make them anymore! I wear them all the time. Sevens [7 For All Mankind] are also really good, and Sacred makes some great jeans. I don't clothes-shop much, so when I like something, I tend to buy four pairs of them.<br /><br /><b>Is everyone asking about your hair?</b><br />Now that I'm blonde, yeah, totally. People are asking, ""Do blondes really have more fun?"" My hair can be any color and I'll <i>always</i> have fun.<br /><br /><b>Wish List : More than anything, Prepon wants to...</b><br /><br /><b>1. Direct a really important movie.</b> I love character-driven films that I can relate to personally.<br /><b>2. Properly thank her mom.</b> She gave us so much freedom, there was nothing to rebel against. I owe her for that.<br /><b>3. Have a big family.</b> I'd love to be there for them and be able to say I raised them all well.<br /><b>4. Fly fish in Alaska.</b> Talk about relieving stress. You're not thinking about anything but catching fish.<br /><b>5. Jam on the piano with a jazz combo.</b> I used to play when I was a kid. The piano is so graceful and beautiful.<br />",Celebrities

But your hormones, not your gut, are really to blame for most <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/get-rid-of-cravings"">binges</a>. Ghrelin, which makes you hungry, and leptin, your primary appetite suppressor, are eternally battling it out. Preventing these hormones from going haywire is the key to reining in calories without always feeling ravenous. So dig in-we're giving you 50 ways to fill up and conquer the growling beast that is your stomach.<br /><br /><b>1. Pack a packet</b> Instant oatmeal beats out All Bran and Muesli for fullness factor. We love Quaker's Weight Control Maple and Brown Sugar-it tastes heavenly and has more fiber, protein, and whole grains than the regular variety.<br /><br /><b>2. Find <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/the-best-fresh-berries"">berry treasure</a></b> Raspberries are one of the most fiber-filled fruits, packing 8 grams into a cupful-a whopping 32 percent of your RDA. Add some to your cereal or yogurt.<br /><br /><b>3. Can the juice</b> Whole fruit has a higher fiber content and makes you feel fuller than fruit juices, even those with pulp.<br /><br /><b>4. Make a dinner date</b> A study found that women eat less than usual on dates (men tend to eat a lot more). <br /><br /><b>5. But don't eat by candlelight</b> Dim light can trigger binge eating. <br /><br /><b>6. Better yet, make it a blind date</b> It's worth a try-dine blindfolded and you'll eat 22 percent less food without missing it. Just watch out for the salad fork.<br /><br /><b>7. Bulk up</b> Soluble fiber expands in your GI tract to make you feel full, so get your 25-gram RDA. That's a packet of oatmeal, two slices of whole-wheat bread, and 1 cup each of broccoli, edamame, and raw carrots.<br /><br /><b>8. Ignore diet labels</b> One study found that after eating full-fat muffins, subjects were less hungry and ate less over the next 24 hours than after eating a fat-free version. <br /><br /><b>9. Hold your breath</b> Just smelling a fresh-baked cupcake in the break room can induce the insulin secretion that makes you think you're hungry. Sight activates the appetite snowball too, so avert your eyes.<br /><br /><b>10. Down a multivitamin</b> Research suggests that your body may compensate for a lack of nutrients by increasing your appetite so you'll eat more. <br /><br /><b>11. Save your bread</b> Dodge the white wonder and go for whole wheat-it's 5.5 times more satisfying. <br /><br /><b>12. Meet meat</b> One study found that people ate 441 fewer calories a day when following a 30 percent protein diet versus a 15 percent protein diet.<br /><br /><b>13. Eat like a cow</b> Graze: Five evenly spaced, 350-calorie mini-meals a day will regulate your appetite and ward off sugar cravings caused by skipping meals.<br /><br /><b>14. Attempt ambidexterity</b> Switch your fork to your nondominant hand-you'll eat much more slowly. That gives you time to recognize your couldn't-eat-another-bite feeling when it first sets in.<br /><br /><b>15. Skip soft drinks</b> High-fructose corn syrup, the main sweetener in soda, doesn't spur insulin production to make the body process calories, nor does it trigger leptin, the hormone that tamps down appetite.<br /><br /><b>16. Trade your corkscrew for a bottle opener </b>Participants in one study ate more food while drinking wine than while drinking beer. Take a sip from <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/best-light-beers""><i>WH</i>'s Best Tasting Light Beers Guide</a>.<br /><br /><b>17. Boost your bean count</b> The musical fruit's high fiber content causes glucose to be released slowly into the bloodstream, preventing the sudden slumps that cause hunger spikes. Add garbanzos or black beans to soup or salad. See <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/recipes""><i>WH</i>'s Recipe Pages</a> for more. <br /><br /><b>18. Shape up</b> Wedge-shaped foods like pizza make it difficult to estimate proper portions. (No wonder the apple pie always goes so fast.)<br /><br /><b>19. Start with soup</b> Have a cup of soup, such as chicken noodle or vegetable, before your entrée-you'll feel fuller sooner and eat fewer calories overall. <br /><br /><b>20. But only one cup</b> Served buffet style, diners ate 73 percent more soup without realizing it or feeling any fuller. <br /><br /><b>21. Bag the dried fruit</b> Go for 2 cups of grapes over a quarter cup of raisins-both are 100 calories, but the grapes' water content feels more filling.<br /><br /><b>22. Dig pop culture</b> Because it's mostly air, popcorn is twice as filling as a candy bar or peanuts, with fewer calories. We like Pop Secret 100-calorie packs. <br /><br /><b>23. Slurp a smoothie</b> Make it with low-fat yogurt and loads of fruit for a satiety trifecta: protein (to decrease hunger), fiber (to fill you up without extra calories), and calcium (to help burn, not store, fat).<br /><br /><b>24. Whey your options</b> Boost that smoothie with 1 to 2 tablespoons of whey powder. New studies suggest that in addition to a protein punch, whey may affect the hormones that make you feel full. In one study, participants who ate a liquid meal made with whey ate significantly fewer calories 90 minutes later than their counterparts.<br /><br /><b>25. Go cuckoo for cocoa</b> Participants in one study were significantly more satisfied 30 minutes after they drank low-fat chocolate milk than they were after they drank soda.<br /><br /><b>continued...</b><br /><br /><b>26. Crunch on raw carrots</b> Researchers in Ireland noted that carrots are more filling when they're uncooked. Bonus: A 1-cup serving has 3.6 grams of fiber.<br /><br /><b>27. Add avocado</b> Your body burns carbohydrates in an hour or two, so toss a little healthy fat into the mix (avocado in salad, peanut butter on bread) to buy a few hours before the pangs hit.<br /><br /><b>28. Start a pack-a-day habit</b> Chewing gum (sugar-free or regular) suppresses your desire for sweets. (If you prefer potato chips, spit out the gum-it may make a salty craving worse.) <br /><br /><b>29. Get nutty</b> Nosh on pine nuts-they have the most protein of any nut or seed, and the pinolenic acid they contain stimulates two powerful hunger-suppressing hormones.<br /><br /><b>30. Listen to Norah Jones</b> Eating while listening to mellow music slows you down. It takes 20 minutes for your stomach to tell your brain it's full-that's the first seven tracks of <i>Come Away with Me.</i><br /><br /><b>31. Go beyond the pale</b> White pasta and other foods made with refined flour cause blood sugar to drop and leave you hungry again in no time. Choose whole-wheat pasta and you'll be satisfied almost twice as long. <br /><br /><b>32. Ride a roller-coaster</b> Nausea is responsible for a subsequent loss of appetite (bring your own barf bag).<br /><br /><b>33. Get hitched</b> A study found that happy marriages lower the risk of metabolic syndrome, which could lead to overeating. Women in consistently dissatisfying marriages were about 3 times more likely to develop metabolic syndrome. Widows carried nearly 6 times the risk.<br /><br /><b>34. Find a new china pattern</b> Research shows that blue is a natural appetite suppressant, so using blue plates, napkins, or placemats may make you eat more slowly and realize when you're full.<br /><br /><b>35. Re-paint your dining room beige</b> Red, yellow, and orange hues stimulate appetite and make you eat more. <br /><br /><b>36. Be antisocial</b> On average, people who eat with one other person consume about 35 percent more than when they dine alone; at a table of four, that figure rises to 75 percent more; if you're in a party of eight you'll nearly double your intake.<br /><br /><b>37. Enjoy your salad days</b> According to one study, women who ate a 100-calorie salad before dinner consumed 12 percent fewer calories during the meal without trying to diet or limit their intake. The fiber in the greens probably helped. <br /><br /><b>38. Choose surf over turf</b> Fish is more satisfying, per calorie, than lean beef or chicken, according to Dr. Susanna Holt's Satiety Index, a ranking of different foods' ability to satisfy hunger.<br /><b><br />39. Live in your own private Idaho</b> If you need starches, yams and white potatoes (with skin) are 7 times more filling than a croissant. Sorry, French fries don't count. <br /><br /><b>40. Practice patience</b> Before you go for seconds, wait 20 minutes. Once the leptin kicks in, you might find you're already full. <br /><br /><b>41. Declare yourself perfect</b> Accept your body and, according to a study at Ohio State University, you're more likely to eat healthily-and not for emotional reasons.<br /><br /><b>42. Request a doggy bag</b> Wrap up half your meal to go before you take the first bite and you're likely to eat less. Study participants who were offered a portion and a half of a food consumed 43 percent more of it and ate 25 percent more calories in the meal overall.<br /><br /><b>43. Have a seaweed spritzer</b> When you mix agar-agar, a fiber-rich thickening agent derived from seaweed, with fruit juice, it soaks up the liquid, making you full-full. Pick it up at Whole Foods Market.<br /><br /><b>44. Make some miso</b> When your metabolism is dragging and your energy dips, you crave foods and drinks that give you a quick lift. New research reveals that protein-rich miso soup boosts metabolism. <br /><br /><b>45. Count sheep</b> Sleep-deprivation leads to lower leptin levels and higher ghrelin levels, boosting your appetite. Try to get at least 7 hours tonight.<br /><br /><b>46. Have a cocktail with lunch</b> Fruit cocktail, that is. Mixed fruit can curb a sweet tooth, and it has plenty of fiber, which helps regulate your blood sugar.<br /><br /><b>47. Eject the junk</b> Science has proven that a food's tasty appearance can trump feelings of fullness. Ask the waiter to remove your plate before you scarf the rest of those fluffy mashed potatoes.<br /><br /><b>48. Turn up the heat</b> Temperature is a satiety signal, and the cooler a room, the more people tend to eat-which is why restaurants often keep thermostats low.<br /><br />And, in the not too distant future...<br /><br /><b>49. Chew on this</b> London researchers found that moderate doses of the ""feeling full"" hormone pancreatic polypeptide reduces the amount of food eaten by 15 to 20 percent. They're working on a chewing gum, but a finished product is still a good 5 years down the line.<br /><br /><b>50. Pop a pill</b> Italian scientists looking to make a more absorbent diaper lining ended up creating a cellulose pill that expands in your stomach to ward off hunger pangs for up to 7 hours.

But when you dig into the research, it turns out our culture isn't as commitment-phobic as it seems. ""Marriage has changed more in the last 30 years than in the previous 3,000,"" says Stephanie Coontz, a professor at the Evergreen State College and author of <i>Marriage, A History.</i> And these changes are actually for the better. Whether you're tying the knot now or planning to someday, it's time to make sense of all this matrimonial madness so you're guaranteed to live happily ever after.<br /><br /><b>We're too busy to be brides.</b><br /><br /><b>25</b> MEDIAN AGE AT WHICH WOMEN GET MARRIED TODAY<br /><b>21</b> MEDIAN AGE AT WHICH WOMEN DID 30 YEARS AGO<br /><br />Around the time you were born, most women were walking down the aisle at the same age you drank your first legal beer and went through your <i>Devil Wears Prada</i> phase. Today, the median age of first marriage is more like 25; 27 if you've gone to college. Getting a law degree or an MBA? Plan to hit the big 3-0 before you get hitched. But we're not stretching out the single life because we're procrastinating or waiting for the perfect guy to come along. Even after college, we pack way more into our 20s than our mothers did (or had the opportunity to) -- getting an advanced degree, renting our first place, lining up thankless internships to pave the way to <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/the-best-career-books"">promising careers</a>. ""Young women are postponing marriage because they're <i>busy</i>,"" says Terri Orbuch, Ph.D., a marriage and family therapist in Detroit and the project director of the Early Years of Marriage study at the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center. ""The past decade has been a whirlwind of personal growth for me,"" says recently married Heather Harding, 31, of Toronto. ""All of which I needed to experience before getting married. I went to grad school, I lived abroad, I tried on a couple of careers. Tying the knot just wasn't on my priority list in my early 20s.""<br /><br />Good news: Research shows that taking the time to score some goals before you settle down makes long-term <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/spend-money-wisely"">happiness</a> more likely. And, according to statistics, marrying young (before your 25th b-day) bumps up your risk of divorce by 24 percent. Some experts -- and probably your mom -- claim that with a quarter of a decade under our belts, we know ourselves better and so can choose a wiser match.<br /><br /><b>We try before we buy.</b><br /><br /><b>62</b> PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN WHO LIVE WITH A BOYFRIEND BEFORE GETTING MARRIED<br /><b>40</b> PERCENTAGE WHO SHACKED UP BEFORE SEALING THE DEAL 30 YEARS AGO<br /><br />Nowadays you're a rebel if you don't swap keys before swapping rings. Mekayla Beaver, 27, of Somerville, Massachusetts, has been living with her boyfriend, Greg, for almost a year. ""I expect to marry him someday,"" she says. ""But neither of us was ready to take that step when we first moved in together."" Within a few months, though, Beaver had relinquished any lingering doubts that he's the one. ""It's just a matter of time before one of us proposes,"" she says. For most of us, living together is a dress rehearsal -- 55 percent of cohabiters get married within 5 years.<br /><br />Moving in with a beau does have some baggage that's worth unpacking. Research from the 1980s and 1990s suggested that people who lived together before marriage faced a higher risk of divorce -- fodder for conservative groups to claim that those couples had a blasé attitude toward commitment that would lead straight to Splitsville and wreak havoc on the traditional notion of family. But newer, more sophisticated studies suggest otherwise. And because cohabitation has become so mainstream, some experts now consider it a natural extension of dating, rather than a diversion from marriage. While it doesn't protect us from divorce, it doesn't make it any more likely.<br /><br />And what about that old worry that your guy will be ""getting the milk for free,"" so he won't bother taking the next step? Forget about it. If anyone is going to put off marriage at this stage, it's probably you. ""In long-term cohabitating couples, research shows that the woman is more likely to be dragging her feet to the altar -- not the man,"" says Dorian Solot, coauthor of <i>Unmarried to Each Other</i> and cofounder of the national Alternatives to Marriage Project. Hardly surprising, given that what being a wife has meant historically -- cooking, cleaning, raising kids -- isn't so appealing on its own anymore. ""Women want to pursue their own goals,"" Solot says. ""And they want to be sure that getting married is going to allow them to be who they want to be.""<br /><br /><b>We love sex -- and always have.</b><br /><br /><b>94</b> PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN WHO HAVE PREMARITAL SEX TODAY<br /><b>93</b> PERCENTAGE WHO DID THE DEED WITHOUT WEDDING BANDS 30 YEARS AGO<br />Researchers say the number of Americans having prenuptial nooky hasn't changed much since the 1940s -- and it didn't necessarily start then either. ""Premarital sex was common in the medieval era,"" Coontz says, ""and throughout history."" The idea that our generation (or even the last few) is the first to embrace unmarried sex is hogwash. Not only did your mom do it, there's a good chance Grandma did too.<br /><br />So, if we've always given in to the heat of the moment, what's changed? ""Over the past 30 years women have become more comfortable owning up to their sexual desires and behavior,"" Coontz says. ""A woman's value isn't tied to her virginity the way it used to be,"" she adds. ""So women don't feel pressure to play the naïve sexual role."" This kind of openness translates into healthier sexual relationships. ""Research shows clearly that today's husbands and wives report far more satisfying and enjoyable sex than couples did in the past,"" she says.<br /><br /><b>We're smarter, and therefore hotter.</b><br /><br /><b>94</b> PERCENTAGE OF COLLEGE-EDUCATED WOMEN WHO TIE THE KNOT TODAY<br /><b>70 to 80</b> PERCENTAGE WHO DID 30 YEARS AGO<br />Back when the Doors were topping the charts, college-educated women were less likely to marry than their peers, making the old saying ""men don't make passes at girls who wear glasses"" pathetically true. Back then, traditional breadwinner-housewife roles in marriage were as rigid as a Botoxed upper lip. But for our generation, the girl in Armani specs and a power suit is the most likely to marry of all. ""Studies show that young men today want the same qualities in a woman that were traditionally considered desirable in a man,"" says Jean Elson, Ph.D., a sociologist at the University of New Hampshire. In other words, someone smart and successful who can share the financial load. But it's about being on the same page intellectually as much as financially. ""Men aren't looking for someone to play fetch anymore,"" says Christine B. Whelan, Ph.D., author of <i>Why Smart Men Marry Smart Women</i>. ""They want to volley with an equal."" According to her research, 71 percent of high-achieving men said a woman's career or educational success makes her more irresistible. And while it seems counterintuitive, women with degrees have the strictest views on divorce. ""In a recent study, 62.5 percent of college-educated women said getting a divorce should be tougher,"" says Steven Martin, Ph.D., a sociologist at the University of Maryland. ""In the 1970s, it was 36 percent."" Experts believe that because college-educated women have stronger support systems and better problem-solving skills, they're more willing to try to work things out.<br /><br /><b>We're committed to going long.</b><br /><br /><br /><b>43</b> PERCENTAGE OF MARRIED COUPLES WHO GET DIVORCED TODAY<br /><b> 48</b> PERCENTAGE WHO DID 30 YEARS AGO<br />Every marriage is haunted by the knowledge that roughly 1 in 2 will fail. But your own chances of divorce aren't exactly the coin toss implied by the stats. At the time of any couple's wedding, certain factors are already present that can dramatically increase -- or decrease -- their odds of success. And here's an eyebrow raiser: The divorce rate isn't actually going up; it's on the decline. The high point of divorce occurred almost 30 years ago and has been inching its way down ever since. Sure, it was far lower in the 1960s, but the comparison is unfair. There's less stigma around divorce today, and it's much easier to get one thanks to laws that speed the process along. Women have greater financial power than ever and can leave a relationship more easily. And the standards for a good marriage are much higher now. ""In the past, all you had to do to qualify as an acceptable husband was be a provider for your family,"" Whelan says. ""The idea of marriage being based on love and mutual respect is very new,"" Coontz adds. ""For most of history, it was more like a business relationship."" Couples in the past didn't expect to find the partnership enjoyable -- just practical.<br /><br />Is today's divorce rate still too high? It's impossible to tell, because no one knows what the rate of divorce should be, or whether marriages in the 1960s would have lasted had divorce been less taboo and easier to obtain. And some experts consider the current rate as proof that our generation is uniquely committed to being happily married. ""My research shows that people take marriage much more seriously now as a quality relationship,"" Coontz says. ""And that's part of the current divorce rate. Women today believe it's better not to be married at all if the marriage doesn't meet this new standard."" Which is why we're the ones to haul off to divorce court more than two-thirds of the time. Crystal Lopez, 26, of Atlanta, recently divorced her husband of 2 years. ""The decision was difficult,"" she says. ""But I see it as evidence of my commitment to marriage, not a lack of it."" In spite of a long courtship, after getting married Crystal found that she and her husband had very different life goals. ""I didn't want to miss out on the chance to have a fulfilling marriage in the future, and it became apparent that it would never be possible if I stayed in this one.""<br /><br /><b>We're more happily married than ever.</b><br /><br /><b>90</b> PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN TODAY WHO ARE DESTINED TO BE BRIDES<br /><b>90</b> PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN 30 YEARS AGO WHO WORE THE WHITE DRESS<br />Despite everything that has changed, the institution of marriage is still going strong. Yes, Bridget Jones had us freaked out for a while. But our chances of getting married are just as good as they were 100 years ago -- even if it doesn't seem that way when we're single and nearly blind from browsing eHarmony ads.<br /><br />Most encouraging of all, tying the knot has become a choice rather than a necessity. It's hard to believe that just 30 years ago marriage was a woman's ticket to financial security, and dual-income families were as rare as a redneck at a Tori Amos concert. But over the past three decades, women have become better educated than men (58 percent of college students are female). And we're just as financially independent: Single women are now twice as likely as single men to buy homes, and nearly 40 percent of babies are now born to unmarried mothers (compared with 5 percent in 1960 and 18 percent in 1980).<br /><br />So if we can do it all ourselves, what keeps us coming back? Maybe we just can't help it. ""All cultures have some type of marriage ritual, suggesting that we're hardwired at the species level to want to marry,"" says James Cordova, Ph.D., a professor of clinical psychology at Clark University who specializes in marriage studies. But the explanation might be even simpler: As social creatures, humans function more effectively in teams. ""We do better when we are in a positive, long-term relationship,"" Cordova says. ""We live longer, we eat and sleep better, our immune systems function more effectively, we're less susceptible to depression, and our children are more likely to thrive."" Now that we're not under as much pressure to get -- and stay -- married, we're more interested in the quality of the partnership. All of which adds up to powerful incentive. ""As a relationship,"" Coontz says, ""marriage is more satisfying now than at any other point in history.""<br />",relationships
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/take-charge-of-your-check-up,Health,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,,Get the Most Out of Your Doctor's Appointment,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0910-patient-stethoscope.jpg,"<p>Your annual physical exam has never been a picnic (tissue-thin gown, anyone?), but these days it can feel like a hit-and-run. As doctors get busier, doctor's appointments get shorter--you're supposed to spill your family history, get a prescription refill (that your <a href=""/life/health-insurance-costs"">insurance</a> will pay for), and have a suspicious mole inspected in less time than it takes to reload your iPod. </p><p>And not only are docs more swamped than ever; sometimes it feels like they're speaking a different language. ""Medical schools teach students how to interact with patients, but by the time doctors start practicing, their bedside manner may be a bit rusty,"" says Sherrie Kaplan, Ph. D., a leading researcher of doctor-patient interactions. Because a satisfied patient is more likely to be a healthy one, according to research from the University of California, Irvine, we got experts to help you beat the time crunch, leap over the communication barrier, and get the medical TLC you need from your <a href=""/health/top-doctors-for-women"">physician</a>. </p><p><b>Problem:</b> <i>Your doctor heads for the door when you've barely had a chance to say ""Ahhh.""<br /></i><br /><b>Solution: </b>Bring a list of <a href=""/health/ask-your-doctor"">questions to ask your doctor</a> and let the doc know at the beginning of your dcoappointment how many items are on your list, says Larry Mauksch, M. Ed., a senior lecturer in family medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle. Don't wait until the end of the appointment to bring up the most important issues. Also worth considering: Johns Hopkins University researchers found that consultations with female physicians are, on average, two minutes longer than those with male ones. </p><p><b>Problem: </b><i>Your doctor speaks in confusing medical jargon or glosses over details.<br /></i><br /><b>Solution:</b> Seventy-eight percent of patients do not fully understand their doctor's instructions, reports a study in the <i>Annals of Emergency Medicine</i>. ""Be blunt and say 'You're using a lot of words I don't understand' or 'I'm not getting the reason behind your recommendation,'"" Mauksch says. Repeat what you think you heard and ask if it's correct, then write it down. If the office uses electronic medical records, request an After Visit Summary, which includes a printout of the M. D.'s recommendations. </p><p><b>Problem: </b><i>Your doctor dismisses your concerns, but you're worried something could be wrong.</i></p><p><b>Solution: </b>Explain why you're concerned. For example, maybe your grandmother died of a brain tumor, and you're afraid that your migraines might mean you have one, too. Expressing your fears clues your doctor in to your family history and gives her some context so she can explain why you should or shouldn't be alarmed (maybe the type of tumor Grandma had doesn't run in families). If you do that and still feel strongly that something isn't right, trust your gut and get a second opinion, Kaplan says. </p><p><b>Problem:</b> <i>Your doctor is impossible to reach between visits.</i></p><p><b>Solution: </b>Next time you're face-to-face, get the 411 on how your doctor can be reached. About 39 percent of physicians communicate with patients via e-mail, so find out if yours is one of them. But if you're granted the e-mail address, keep your messages short, and don't expect a rapid response. (In other words, a case of food poisoning should land you in the ER, not in your doc's in-box.)

The nurse practitioner who'd strapped the fetal monitor to my belly smiled. ""Wow, that child is already so strong,"" she said. ""The next few months of your life are going to be very interesting."" I didn't pay much attention. I was too enraptured with this raucous new life sparking inside me - the first science project I had ever, to my knowledge, performed correctly. But I soon discovered the truth in my nurse's veiled warning. The next 6 months were plenty interesting. I experienced elation, despair, indigestion, fluctuating blood sugar, and a mad craving for pineapple juice - not to mention the vomiting. It was the loveliest and most disagreeable time of my life.<br /><br />Pregnancy can make a woman glow. But it also can give her acne and make her sick, exhausted, crabby, or worse. It's distressingly common for <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/tips-for-a-healthy-pregnancy"">pregnant women</a> to develop severe conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes, resulting in some 10 million injuries and 529,000 deaths worldwide annually, according to the World Health Organization. Gestation and labor are, frankly, hard work - which is perhaps why nature saw fit to apportion the task to females.<br /><br />In the mid-19th century, most doctors believed that human babies came ready-made - that every human egg contained a tiny infant that, like a sea monkey, would unfold and grow when exposed to the right ingredients. Of course, back then people also thought raw meat spawned maggots through spontaneous generation. Thankfully, our understanding of reproduction has progressed a bit. The union of a woman's egg and a man's sperm, each containing only one DNA strand, produces a human embryo. The two strands join and the resulting cell, called a zygote, possesses a full set of genes, half from each parent. The zygote divides into two cells, then four, then eight, and so on, until the full-fledged embryo burrows into the womb.<br /><br />Doctors used to take a Hallmark view of <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/pregnancy-nutrition"">pregnancy</a>. They considered it a harmonious process, with the baby as the passive recipient of gentle nurturing from Mom. Today, emerging facts about fetal genetics reveal that baby-making is actually a rather harsh contest. It's a battle between the agendas of the fetus, its mother, and - not to be forgotten - the father, whose genes are also in there, squabbling and scheming away. ""Pregnancy may be the most intimate relationship in all of nature,"" says evolutionary biologist David Haig, Ph.D., of Harvard University. ""But it is not one body, one flesh."" All the issues, in fact, that keep family therapists in business - greed, selfishness, misunderstandings, furtive alliances - start at conception.<br /><br />Remember <i>Alien</i>? Okay, it's a stretch, but not as big a one as we might like to think. Every pregnancy brings together two beings, with different DNA, who must share a single body for 9 months. Practically from day one, the fetus sends damaging substances into its mother in an effort to increase its own nutrition and blood supply. The mom protects herself by shutting down some of the fetus's more assertive genes - akind of genetic time-out - and by releasing proteins that help her hoard nutrients. This struggle spawns many of the complications of pregnancy - from morning sickness to more severe conditions like high blood pressure. The mother's genes want a healthy baby, but they also want her to stay fit enough to have more children. The baby's genes couldn't care less about brothers and sisters. They say: Gimme gimme gimme. It's a mix, Dr. Haig says, ""of cooperation and exploitation.""<br /><br />But there's good news in all this for anyone who's considering joining the baby-making fray. Research is pointing the way to better diagnostic tests for monitoring the health of mother and child. And knowledge is power. The more you know about what's going on in your body during the prizefight that is pregnancy, the better equipped you'll be to make sure no one comes out a loser.<br /><br /><b>[Round 1]Mom vs. Dad</b><br /><br />No matter how well meaning any particular father is, from an evolutionary perspective, dads are faithless hounds. <i>Homo sapiens</i> was not designed for monogamy. The genes a father bestows on his offspring have different ambitions from those contributed by the mother. Dad's genes aren't overly concerned with the welfare of his current flame, since he may hook up with a different female down the road. (Mom might stray as well, but her genes will always work in her best interests.)<br /><br />You can see a father's selfish genes at work in baby fat. Most mammals come into the world as skin and bones and quickly put on padding afterward. A flying squirrel weighs a tenth of an ounce at birth, just 2 percent of its adult heft. Human babies, by contrast, can grow to a roly-poly 10 pounds in the womb - 6percent or more of their adult weight. Those pounds of flesh come directly from the mother - and in addition to providing the nutrition to produce that fat, she has to go through the hardship of squeezing such a plump baby out. ""There's not much evolutionary sense to the size of human babies,"" Dr. Haig says.<br /><br />Not for Mom, maybe, but how about for the guy who only has to attend Lamaze classes and strap in the car seat? A bigger baby is a healthier baby, a man's genes reason. (Genes don't really think, of course, but they survive when they're successful, which makes them seem purposeful.) Male mice - and likely male humans as well - give their babies a gene that tells the fetus to pack on pounds. Mom fights back by, apparently, shutting off her copy of that gene and instead contributing a different one that tries to keep fetuses small. Dad, predictably, shuts down his version of that gene. But Mom's don't-grow-big message isn't as strong as Dad's eat-up encouragement, so the result is that chubby newborn. It's a sort of precustody battle, with the ultimate victor being the fetus.<br /><br /><b>[Round 2 ]Mom vs. Fetus</b><br /><br />You wouldn't hand your teenager your purse. But scientists are discovering that a developing tot is already busy rifling through its mom's bodily resources. For starters, it restructures its mother's circulatory system - consider it a sort of ad hoc engineering project. Early in pregnancy, the tiny embryo sends out grasping, tendril-like cells called trophoblasts that clamp it to the uterine wall. These cells then go to work on the mother's blood vessels. They widen her arteries and thin her arteries' walls to speed food delivery to the baby through the placenta.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the mother's body tamps down its immune system to keep it from attacking what is essentially foreign tissue. That's why pregnant women are more susceptible to colds and the flu - not to mention the blotchy, reptilian-looking rash that sprouted on my upper arms. As if that's not enough self-sacrifice, the fetus sends proteins into Mom's bloodstream to ensure she won't eat (or keep down) foods like coffee and alcohol that might harm it. You got it: Morning sickness, which afflicts up to 85 percent of pregnant women, is brought to you by Junior.<br /><br />That's why nausea is worst in early pregnancy, when a fetus's fragile organs are developing, according to a recent study by biologist Paul Sherman, Ph.D., of Cornell University, and his then graduate student Samuel Flaxman. In addition, nausea is notably rare in pregnancies that end in miscarriage. It takes a healthy fetus to make a mom truly miserable.<br /><br />From there it just gets worse. The placenta pumps proteins into Mom to make her body resistant to insulin, raising her blood sugar levels and providing a banquet for baby. Most women compensate by making more insulin, but some can't. These women end up with gestational diabetes, which occurs in about 4 percent of all pregnancies. Although the condition goes away once the woman gives birth, it can make her 20 to 50 percent more likely to develop diabetes in the future. Thanks a lot, kid. Your doctor will monitor your blood sugar during pregnancy and, if a problem arises, will treat it by adjusting your diet (no sweets!) or, in the worst cases, prescribing insulin shots.<br /><br />Another 5 percent of pregnant women develop dangerously high blood pressure, a condition known as preeclampsia. The placenta, the baby's lifeline, has low blood pressure and relies on the naturally higher blood pressure of the mother's body to pump in nutrients. If Mom's blood pressure can be made to rise even more, all the better: The fetus will get an even greater share. The placenta achieves this goal by producing a protein called sFlt1, which makes it difficult for a woman's body to repair old blood vessels and create new ones, according to new research by Ananth Karumanchi, M.D., a kidney specialist at Harvard Medical School. Women have 4 pounds of extra blood circulating during pregnancy, and they need those additional blood vessels to carry it. If they can't build them, their blood pressure will rise.<br /><br />Most pregnant women respond to this unwelcome sFlt1 invasion by making a protein that promotes blood vessel growth, which soon stabilizes the pressure. But women who are obese, who already had high blood pressure, or who have some still-undiscovered genetic defect may develop preeclampsia, according to Dr. Karumanchi. That's why doctors test pregnant women's urine - if they find protein, it's a sign that the kidneys are malfunctioning and blood pressure is rising. If that happens to you, your doctor will monitor you carefully and perhaps even deliver the baby early to prevent you from suffering the worst-case scenario: seizures, organ failure, and even death.<br /><br />But Dr. Karumanchi's research isn't all gloomy. He and his colleagues hope to find a way to block excessive sFlt1. Within 5 years, your child's attempts to raise your blood pressure may be in vain - at least until his or her teenage years.<br /><br /><b>[Round 3]Pulling Some Punches</b><br /><br />I wouldn't want to leave you thinking there's no love or reciprocity in pregnancy. You just have to look hard. In the mid-1990s, Diana Bianchi, M.D., a professor of pediatrics at Tufts University School of Medicine, was trying to develop a new way to test fetuses for Down syndrome when she made an astonishing discovery: She found male stem cells in the blood of women carrying female fetuses. In each case, the cells were from an earlier pregnancy with a boy. Research has since proven that babies leave a part of themselves behind in their mothers, apparently for life.<br /><br />Unlike the stem cells harvested from frozen embryos that have gotten so much press of late, these cells aren't politically or ethically iffy. They're already inside any woman who has ever been pregnant (even if the pregnancy ended in abortion or miscarriage). And they could be lifesavers. Fetal stem cells have been found clustered at brain and liver injuries in female mice, where they were apparently attempting to repair the damage. ""It's certainly conceivable that eventually we will discover how to harness these cells,"" Dr. Bianchi says, turning them into molecular MASH units. Your son or daughter may someday give you renewed life, as you once gave life to him or her.<br /><br />Unfortunately, fetal stem cells occasionally turn bad. If their genetic markers are very similar to those of the mother's cells, her immune system can go haywire, leading to autoimmune diseases like scleroderma, which causes hardening of the skin, cartilage, and other connective tissue. As scientists learn more about managing autoimmune diseases, however, they might start checking for the compatibility of cells between mother and child early in a pregnancy to identify which women need early intervention, says J. Lee Nelson, M.D., a professor of rheumatology atthe University of Washington.<br /><br />For now we can't make decisions about what genes we'll pass to our kids or tell a selfish placenta to keep its proteins to itself. But we can use the emerging science to arm ourselves. Since your baby is going to take as much as he or she can, make sure you get the nutrients you need (see ""<a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/article/0,,s1-3-70-1236-1,00.html"">Eating for Two</a>""). And score some back rubs from Dad, since he's more implicated in your physical hardships than he may realize.<br /><br />Then take a deep breath and accept that pregnancy is a skirmish that doesn't come close to ending at birth. My son, Max, who is now 9, still commands a breathtakingly disproportionate share of familial resources. Have you priced an Xbox lately? Or orthodontia? Still, as I fold his socks, make him breakfast, and play chauffeur, it's nice to know that someday his stem cells may save my life. I'm going to hold him to that. If you're ever pregnant, I advise you to place your hands on your belly and remind your growing baby that you expect the same. It's never too early to start instilling that sense of powerful obligation that every child should feel toward its mother. That's how, in the end, we wily moms always win.<br />",Special Reports

But when it comes to your job, there's one skill that's every bit as important as the work you do and the results you deliver: the ability to make connections with people.<br /><br /><br /><br />""The truth is, people aren't promoted only because of hard work. You have to be just as focused on building relationships,"" says career coach Lois P. Frankel, Ph.D., author of <i>Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office</i>. In fact, she says, ""If you're not spending 5 percent of your day concentrating on this, you're doing something wrong."" Why? ""To be promoted into leadership roles, you need to be likable. And that means being social,"" says corporate recruiter Joy Chen. It comes down to plain old psychology. ""Within an organization, people want to be around others who they're comfortable with,"" says psychiatrist Mark Goulston, M.D., author of <i>Just Listen: Discover the Secret of Getting Through to Absolutely Anyone</i>. ""And the way people feel comfortable is by getting to know you.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Surprisingly, many women struggle with this idea. We may be the gender known for relationship skills, but men are way ahead of us in work relationships. Whereas many women see it as ""wasting the company's money"" to do something other than focus on the task at hand, men know that when they're talking about last weekend's golf scores, they're building alliances that will later work for them.<br /><br /><br /><br />What's holding us back? ""Women tend to have a more serious 'I need to prove myself' mentality,"" says executive coach and licensed counselor Laura Steck, president of the Growth and Leadership Center in Sunnyvale, California. ""They don't realize it's not only OK to use their more feminine aspects at work, but that they're hurting themselves if they don't.""<br /><br /><br /><br />In other words, what might seem frivolous isn't. Goulston says some women feel that if they talk about fashion or food, they'll seem less powerful. But, he continues, ""men can talk about sports and don't consider that a waste of time."" It helps that a lot of men's hobbies embody qualities that are good for business-such as competition-which can make it seem as if guy talk has a more purposeful quality than, say, a chat about shoe shopping.<br /><br /><br /><br />But bosses think it's important for men and women to know how to connect with coworkers. One CEO told Steck about a female employee who did great work but was perceived as standoffish because she never socialized. Despite her talent, when it came time for promotions, she didn't get one. And Frankel notes that among the people who were laid off in the current recession, those who didn't have strong work relationships are in a worse place than others who lost their jobs. ""When you go to look for your next position,"" she says, ""those connections are going to help.""<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Pencil It In</b><br /><br /><br />Whether you're trying to meet a deadline in an office or pull together a teaching plan for your class, it's easy to push socializing to the bottom of your priority list. Not smart-if you don't schedule it, it might not happen. If you're not good at this, says Frankel, ""use your online calendar or cell phone to set an alarm that goes off once in the morning and once in the afternoon. That's your cue to get up for five minutes and have a 'doorway conversation.' Don't sit down-just stop by. You might say, 'My in-laws are coming to town. I know you're a gourmet. Can you suggest a good dish?' "" Likewise, if someone brings in cupcakes for a coworker's birthday, take a break and join in. ""Birthday parties, lunches, people going out after work-these are not optional,"" she says. ""You don't have to go every single time, but do it enough that you're considered a member of the team. It's about being seen.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Find a Friendly Ear</b><br /><br /><br />Of course, not everyone is a social genius, so if you feel awkward about reaching out, approach those who seem easygoing and nonjudgmental. ""Don't bother with the coworker who's always talking behind someone's back,"" says Goulston. ""Ask the person you think is the most friendly to lunch.""<br /><br /><br /><br />Start with people at your own level and focus on stuff other than work. If you know that your coworker is an avid tennis player, ask for tips on how to fix your own crappy serve; if his daughter just started school, ask how she's adjusting. And while you need to give up something about your own life, Frankel cautions that nobody has to know all the gory details. Keep it positive. There's no need to mention that you were up until 2 a.m. arguing with your ""mentally unstable"" sister about your parents' anniversary gift.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Gossip Wisely</b><br /><br /><br />Socializing is all well and good, but gossip is deadly, right? Not necessarily. If you're smart about it, gossiping can help you bond with your coworkers. ""It keeps you up on information like the boss's birthday and helps you navigate office politics,"" says Steck. Adds Frankel: ""You want to be tuned in, and you don't want to be the person in the group who always listens but has nothing to say, because then you seem like an outsider."" Gossip can even be used strategically as a way of boosting people behind their backs (""Did you hear Amy nailed that account?"")-which, ahem, makes <i>you</i> look good.<br /><br /><br /><br />Women should gossip more like men do, says Robert Sutton, a professor at Stanford University and author of <i>Good Boss, Bad Boss: How to Be the Best...and Learn from the Worst</i>. ""Guys gossip incessantly, but it's brief,"" he says. ""A guy will say 'He's an A-hole' in an offhand way and move on. Women tend to get emotionally involved and have a harder time letting go of some juicy tidbit.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Set Boundaries</b><br /><br /><br />While building connections, remember: Friendships in the workplace are tricky. Even coworkers who seem like your pals might not be the best people to invite into your home. ""I don't suggest taking friendships outside of work,"" says Frankel, ""but if you do, be careful. Find people who are discreet and mature.""<br /><br /><br /><br />In the end, she says, it's all about balance. ""You have to appear human, and humans are social creatures. But be sure you know where work ends and your personal life begins.""<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p>",Woman to Woman

I can almost see you: just 19, a closed fist of a girl, a Newport nesting between your fingers. Having lit up for the first time just 6 months ago, you're already violently in love with your slim white cylinders. They warm you like tiny campfires. Life would be so cold and dark without them.<br /><br />Give yourself a few decades. Eventually, you see the light - and I don't mean the one at the end of a mini Bic. You want to <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/quit-smoking-without-weight-gain"">quit smoking</a>. You're sick of worrying about the tumor you know might be growing at this very second in one smoke-scarred lung, tired of groveling to strangers who sneer and flap their hand as you light up and blow your smoke toward the ceiling, ashamed that one part of you smokes to keep thin, pissed beyond words that you stand in the rain/snow/cold to indulge a behavior that could very well kill you. You have everything going for you - beautiful son, loving husband and family, successful career, money in the bank. You want to live. Plus, you'll look like shit in an oxygen tent.<br /><br />Smoking becomes a metaphorical chain around your ankle, binding you not just to an early death from <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/lung-cancer-survivor"">lung cancer</a>, but to puffy eyes, skin the color of oatmeal, and tiny vertical lines around your lips that make you look as if you've spent your life whistling, a skill you've never actually mastered. So on a bleak November morning 20 years later, you decide to make a last-ditch, desperate bid to break your pack-a-day habit. You turn over your 7-year-old son, Daniel, to your ex-husband, Matt, for a week - and lock yourself to your dining room radiator. That's right. You literally chain yourself to a hunk of hot metal for 7 full days of cold-turkey agony.<br /><br />Your second husband, John, pronounces you demented. To which you reply, ""Yes, but brilliantly so."" Then you implement Lockdown, as you call your voluntary house arrest. It goes like this:<br /><br /><b>1.</b>Schedule week's vacation from job as editor, where you produce books about the benefits of a healthy diet and moderate exercise.<br /><b>2.</b>Go to Home Depot. Purchase 72 feet of thick, shiny, brushed nickel chainand two heavy-duty combination locks.<br /><b>3.</b>Force long-suffering husband to lock one end of chain around left ankle and fasten the other end around radiator in dining room each morning before he leaves for work.<br /><b>4.</b>Sleep. Weep. Stare into space. Call John to complain of boredom. Wander from room to room, rattling like Marley's ghost as you white-knuckle cravings. Watch Lifetime movies and Maury Povich until you want to empty a .44-caliber handgun into the TV, Elvis style.<br /><b>5.</b>Wonder how it came to this.<br /><br />On the surface, Lockdown's logic seems obvious: You're out of options. You've tried everything to quit. Zyban. Nicotine gum. Nicotine patches the color of old-lady support hose, which - when peeled from your upper arm or buttock - leave large, itchy welts. Tearful, eyes-on-the-ceiling, knees-on-the-floor prayers asking God to touch his thumb to your forehead and allow you to throw down your cigarettes like a crutch (it's a miracle!). But pharmaceuticals and prayer fail you, leaving you to pin your hopes on 72 feet of chain purchased off the roll for 69 cents a foot. Why become a chain gang of one? Because you are - and forever will be - a drama queen. And, more to the point, you're not screwing around anymore. What resolve cannot accomplish, dammit, cold steel can.<br /><br />Of course, there are deeper reasons for your current predicament. Let me explain as I shuffle my way to the loo. (When you're fettered by a 40-pound chain, the simple act of peeing becomes a test of endurance.) At 33, married 6 months to Matt, you get pregnant. You quit smoking, of course; you're not a monster. But less than a year after Daniel's birth, you're back on the sticks. At 34, guilt-ridden, you plunk him in his car seat, roll down the window, and light up. At 36, you sneak out of his third birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese's, closing your eyes as the nicotine ignites your brain like a Fourth of July sparkler. At 39, you puff apologetically at his soccer games under other mothers' accusing eyes. At 40, you find yourself in this very room - unshowered, your mood as sour as your skin, your glasses askew on the bridge of your oily nose - shackled like a lunatic at Bedlam.<br /><br />Listen to the chain clank between the fits of weeping, 3-hour naps, and Maury's unending paternity tests. Each link is a story about how cigarettes pulled you in. They all sound pretty much the same: You felt like an outsider. You didn't understand that comfort is self-generated, like body heat, so you settled for the next best thing: the anesthesia of smoke. One link is your childhood - your young mother, AWOL father, then stepfather and new baby brother. You saw yourself as an intruder, a leftover. You rejected them before they could reject you. Another link, your troubled adolescence - a budding alcoholic, you stole Dad's liquor and squirreled it away in old condiment bottles. (Remember the taste of ketchup-flavored vodka and gin with the faintest hint of Italian dressing?) Over the next 8 years, you drank enough vodka tonics to fill a Jacuzzi and slept with more losers than Tara Reid. Eventually, you quit drinking and found God. No Bibles, no brimstone. Your Supreme Being is more like Kurt Vonnegut, a longtime aficionado of Pall Malls. Through it all, cigarettes were your only constant. They were your friends, your protectors, and your only reliable source of comfort.<br /><br />Lying on the couch, the chain curled at my feet like a faithful dog, I can almost smell your Newport. The smoker in me whispers: Screw this. Just dig through the trash, find your last cigarette, and dry it in the oven on a piece of aluminum foil. Then turn on the stove, bend to the heated front coil with the butt in your mouth, and puff until it catches. Go on - singe a lock of your hair in the process, as you always do. Enjoy the aroma of burnt hair mingling with the delicious odor of smoke. Maybe I would, if John hadn't taken out the garbage. I'm not desperate enough to rattle out the door in my frumpy robe like an escaped sex slave. Well, not yet.<br /><br />But another part of me - the strongest, wisest, best part - says no. I want to live. Deep down, so do you, an epiphany you'll experience 20 years from now, after approximately 153,000 cigarettes. I want to live to see Daniel grow up. Grow old with my husband, so that we can bicker in rocking chairs and discuss our bowels. Savor every minute of a life that, I assure you, will be both frustrating and indescribably lovely. That is why, in 20 years, you commit the most sensible act of your life: You chain yourself to a radiator. Of course you know this strange but noble experiment could end in failure, as your other attempts have. Even so, you won't forget Lockdown's ultimate lesson: We forge our own chains, and it's up to us to break them.<br /><br /><i>Six weeks after Lockdown, Julia Hansen resumed smoking.

I am 18 years old and in possession of: a high school diploma; a tiny, windowless room at the dilapidated grandmother of a boarding house known as the Carolyn Hotel, two blocks from the beach; a beater Chevy Chevette with 200,000 miles on it; and a much-coveted job as a beach inspector. I am dating a lifeguard named Spider who drives a gold Nova with she's only rock and roll emblazoned across the back window. I work each day from 10 to 5, checking people's beach tags; patrolling for illegal kites, dogs, and Frisbees; and bringing all the cutest lifeguards cheesesteaks for lunch.</p><p>After work, the other girls and I hit a Wendy's all-you-can-eat salad bar for dinner. Alicia, another beach inspector, has taught us all to go for the $1.69 Small Salad Bar and how to shore up the sides of the cardboard container using a complicated arrangement of carrot sticks and cucumber slices to increase its volume threefold. Afterward, we shower, beautify, and drive to Art Stock's Playpen, where we will show our fake IDs and dance to the music of Backstreets, the best <a href=""/fitness/bruce-springsteen-playlist"">Bruce Springsteen</a> cover band on the Jersey Shore, from 10 p.m. until 5 in the morning. I'll leave with Spider and we'll make out in the Nova for an hour or so before reuniting with the girls (who have been making out in <i>their</i> lifeguards' cars) for the drive back to the Carolyn and a few hours' sleep before it's time to hit the beach and start all over again. </p><p>I am aware, even as it's happening, that I'm living an 18-year-old's perfect summer, and every single moment of it has a Springsteen song as its soundtrack: At the Playpen, we dance like maniacs to ""Rosalita."" In the Nova, we kiss on the downbeat of ""She's the One."" I wake up in the morning with the reassuring refrain of ""Jersey Girl"" in my head:<i> Down the shore everything's all right. </i></p><p><b></b></p><b></b><p><b>The Night's Bustin' Open</b><br />Everything is <i>more </i>than all right. I have a room of my own, an invitation to the lifeguard ball, and a gaggle of girlfriends who, like me, know every single word of ""Blinded by the Light,"" which we sing--shout, really--at the tops of our lungs on the way to the Playpen. We've all been lucky enough to have seen the real Bruce in concert, in Asbury Park or Philadelphia, and the lead singer of Back­streets has the butt, and the voice, and that leap from the top of the amp right into the full-on-knee-slide-all-the-way-across-the-stage down so well that every night we can relive the feeling of being in the Boss's presence. </p><p>We come from the upper end of the middle class, insulated from the characters in ""Jungleland"" and ""Meeting Across the River"" by, among other things, the inevitability of college. We know little about street gangs or factories. But what we want more than anything is to be Mary in ""Thunder Road."" We are brown from walking the beach all summer, blonde from the two daily swims we are allowed, fit from the all-night dancing. We see ourselves on that dilapidated porch. We can hear the screen door slam. There's Bruce in the car, and we understand that the door is open and the ride ain't free, but, unlike Mary, we wouldn't hesitate for even a second; we'd climb right in, college and our parents be damned. </p><p>But then the summer is over, and college arrives with its pressures and its theories and all its musical sophistications: first Talking Heads, then The Police, then R.E.M. Throughout the '80s, Bruce seems to be changing too. When Patti joins the E Street Band for the <i>Born in the U.S.A.</i> tour, we all figure he'll marry her; how could he not, the way she plays that guitar? But in 1985 he marries an actress who doesn't seem to like him very much, and then the music turns sad. </p><p><b></b></p><b></b><p><b>The Ties That Bind</b><br /><i><br />Born to Run</i> must have gotten into my bloodstream like a kind of religion--I turn out to be way too good at running from anything that makes me feel safe. My first marriage blows up around the same time as Bruce's. During the next two decades, I try to carve out my own version of a life. First I'm a river guide, then a hunting guide, a grad student, a writer. I deal with career success almost as poorly as I deal with being loved, and I realize I'm going to have to learn how to do both if I'm ever going to be happy. It feels as if Bruce and I both turn inward for a while, him writing sad songs, me writing sad books, trying to fix what's broken inside of us. </p><p>Then 9/11 happens, and my idea of safety gets tilted on its axis. All of a sudden, my last breakup and whatever book I can't seem to finish seem like small potatoes compared with all that loss. The next year Bruce explodes out of his period of introspection with <i>The Rising.</i> The lyrics are full of brand-new commitment to love and to art and to undying hope in the face of the worst possible thing. In the wake of the attacks, I take a university teaching job in Davis, California, hoping to create a place for young writers to speak their minds. Bruce comes to Sacramento on the Rising tour. It's 2003--20 years since I've seen him in concert, more than 10 since I've been to an arena show of any kind. My seats turn out to be about as far from the stage as is physically possible, and I spend the hour-long sound check on the verge of leaving--<i>too old, too far away...What was I thinking? </i></p><p>Then in comes the old E Street Band, every one of them: Van Zandt, grizzled but not too much the worse for wear; Clarence, grander than ever in a black three-piece suit. And there's Patti--who Bruce finally had the good sense to marry--in a buckskin coat with all that gorgeous hair, cranking up her guitar. And there is Bruce himself, 53 years old and into that heart-stopping knee slide during the bridge on ""Rosalita."" He stands up a little slowly, makes a crack about how he has only one of those in him per night these days, and then launches right back into the song full throttle. I think: <i>He might be the ­hardest-working artist in America. I think: The summer of 1980 was one particular and pure kind of happiness. I think: How in the world does he still have that butt? </i></p><p>I see him sidle up to Patti for a solo, and think: <i>They've got all those years behind them now, and three kids, and wow do they look like they love each other. </i>I squeeze the hand of the man sitting beside me, who I am full of hope about, and think: <i>Maybe along the way both Bruce and I have learned something about making love last.</i> I close my eyes as the first notes of ""Thunder Road"" tumble from the piano. I am filled with a deep gratitude for the accident that allowed my life to coincide with the life of this musician. For the next three hours, time disappears.</p><p></p><p><b>Springsteen serenade: Pam's Ultimate Bruce Playlist</b><br /><b><br />1.</b> ""Growin' Up"" <br /><b><br />2.</b> ""For You""<br /><b><br />3.</b> ""4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)"" <br /><b><br />4.</b> ""Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)"" <br /><b><br />5.</b> ""Thunder Road""<br /><b><br />6.</b> ""Born to Run""<br /><b><br />7.</b> ""Jungleland""<br /><b><br />8.</b>""She's the One""<br /><b><br />9.</b>""Candy's Room""<br /><b><br />10.</b>""Mary's Place""<br /><b><br />11.</b>""The Rising""<br /><b><br />12.</b>""Radio Nowhere""</p>",Woman to Woman

Between being ready for tomorrow's monster meeting and making sure Rufus gets his yearly shots on time, you've got enough deadlines in your life. Which is exactly why you've spent no time thinking about the public debut of your new Triscuit-sized bikini. Until now, that is, when heat, sunshine, and visions of a beach vacation make you want to dress light - and feel lighter. Okay, so you haven't been religious about your workouts the last few months; we understand. But we also realize that all it takes is one good cram session to change your body. Yes, you'll have to work hard to do it, but this rapid <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss"">women's weight loss</a> plan will flatten and <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/total-body-workout-8"">tone </a>you in just 3 weeks. In fact, by combining proper nutrition with an intense - yet thoroughly doable - 21-day exercise program, the average fit woman can lose as many as 15 pounds, says Ronald Deitrick, Ph.D., director of exercise science at the University of Scranton. To build a program that <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/basics-to-boost-metabolism"">revs your metabolism</a> and burns as many calories as possible in 3 weeks, we teamed with exercise physiologist Tom Holland, who took a 6-week program and kicked it up a few notches. Now, you just have to do the same.<br /><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/quick-total-body-workout"">CHECK OUT A NO-WAIT WORKOUT TO GIVE YOU THE BEST--AND FASTEST--RESULTS</a><br /><br /><b>Week One</b><br /><br /><b>Prepare Your Body to Work</b><br />To get your metabolism moving, you need to get your muscles working. ""Muscle naturally burns calories, so the more of it you have, the more calories you'll burn at rest,"" Holland says. Aim for 4 days of resistance training this week, along with 30 to 45 minutes of cardio training on the off days. Use these tips to maximize your strength building in this short amount of time so that you can build your foundation fast.<br /><br /><b>Power Your Pump</b><br />Holland suggests adding weight and lowering your reps when lifting. ""It's better for strength building because you're working power versus endurance,"" he says. You'll tax your muscles more, making this more efficient for muscle building in a tight time frame. Women, thankfully, have little testosterone, the hormone responsible for bulking up. But some women have more of it than others. If you tend to be stocky, stick to your regular amount of weight, says trainer Brenda Powell, general manager of the Institute of Human Performance in Boca Raton, Florida. But if you have an average build, you should lift weights heavy enough that you can only complete eight reps, and keep adding weight with each set until you can only do four or five reps. Try this every other strength session to keep your muscles challenged.<br /><br /><b>Push Your Muscles </b><br />Organize your strength sessions so that you have 2 days of them back to back. ""You'll work your muscles harder - almost shock them into shape,"" Holland says. ""When you break them down more, they'll repair and build up more."" For example, lift weights on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. You'll have enough rest time on Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday to recover, but if you're sore, do different exercises to challenge your muscles from different angles. You'll actually benefit from doing a range of exercises since your muscles will constantly be challenged to adapt, and you'll burn more calories while they're forced to work harder.<br /><br /><br /><b>Stay Fueled</b><br />Powell says your insulin levels drop during intense exercise (anything where you're working at 75 percent of your maximum heart rate, such as a spinning class). When your insulin levels become irregular, your body produces cortisol, a stress hormone that breaks down muscle and has been linked to belly fat production. You need to replenish your glycogen stores as you work to regulate your insulin levels. ""Anytime you do multiple sets, your glycogen levels drop 40 percent,"" Powell says. Sip a sports drink during intense exercise. Don't worry about the calories: An 8-ounce serving of Gatorade contains just 50 of them. And though water is fine for moderate exercise, for intense sessions you'll need the calories and electrolytes to keep your muscles and metabolism primed.<br /><br /><b>Make Use of the Magic Window</b><br />The 45-minute period after exercise is the best time for your body to metabolize nutrients, Powell says. Your metabolism is already elevated from your workout, and when you refuel correctly, you can keep the fire burning. Eat something that has carbs to restore glycogen and protein to help build muscle. Go for a grilled chicken sandwich or yogurt with almonds and fruit. It's ideal if you can eat within the first 20 minutes after exercise since you'll be able to regulate your blood sugar faster. ""You can also eat one-third of your daily calories within the 3 hours postexercise, because your body is in high-burn mode, and will metabolize the calories faster,"" Powell says. <br /><br /><b>Mix Your Meals</b><br />Always mix protein, carbs, and fat when you eat, says Ann Yelmokas McDermott, Ph.D., a nutrition scientist at Tufts University. You need the blend to fuel your body and stay satiated. Whenever you have one group alone, you're more likely to feel hungrier sooner and consume more food. And don't fear healthy fats. ""They take longer to break down in the gut, so you'll feel fuller longer and will end up consuming less calories,"" McDermott says. Instead of spooning fat-free yogurt, for example, choose low-fat. Stir-fry veggies in olive oil, or spread peanut butter on a bagel. <br /><br /><b>Week Two </b><br /><br /><b>Max Your Metabolism</b><br />Now that you've gotten into a groove and built some muscle, you should increase your intensity to further boost your metabolism. To start, swap one of your strength workouts for an extra cardio day to give yourself more time to burn calories at a higher level, and add a session of intervals to make your cardio more intense. (For example, you could now make Tuesday a cardio day instead of strength.) <br /><br /><b>Flood Yourself </b><br />Drinking more water can maximize your metabolism. Researchers at the University of Utah found that dehydration (from sweating) can slow your resting metabolism (RMR) by 2 percent, which, if your RMR is 1,500 calories, amounts to 30 unburned calories per day. In another study they found that drinking 12 8-ounce glasses of water raises metabolism higher than drinking four or eight 8-ounce glasses. ""Drinking more water also increases energy, along with the desire to exercise,"" says researcher Wayne Askew, Ph.D., professor of nutrition at the University of Utah. If you can drink two tall bottles of water a day, you'll help your metabolism peak.<br /><br /><br /><b>Stop and Go</b><br />Instead of jogging for half an hour, do intervals. Sprint for a minute, and then rest for a minute. The change in intensity will increase your metabolism and allow you to work harder while giving you time to breathe. Holland suggests using dice to make your intervals interesting. If using one die, or even two, multiply the number you roll by 10, and sprint for that many seconds (then rest for double that amount). You can also use the dice for circuit intervals during your weight routine. If you roll an odd number, do crunches - and use the number you roll to get your reps. If you get an even number, do squats or pushups. It's a simple way to keep your workout varied and keep yourself moving. For extra fat burning, Powell says to add intervals after 45 minutes of strength training. She suggests doing three to five sets of 1-minute hard intervals, with 2-minute recovery periods. <br /><br /><b>Rest Actively</b><br />When you rest between sets, stay active to keep your heart rate up. Work a different muscle group - if you're doing lunges, do pushups between sets. You could also add cardio by performing jumping jacks or jogging in place. A cumulative 10 minutes of these exercises during rest will torch an extra 85 calories. <br /><br /><b>Add Protein</b><br />Increase your protein intake to rev your metabolism. ""The body has to work harder to process it because it contains nitrogen, which is metabolically expensive,"" Dr. Deitrick says. But eating too much protein can make you tired because your body is using its energy to digest. General RDA dietary requirements include 0.4 grams of protein for every pound of body weight. For a 140-pound woman, that's 56 g. Dr. Deitrick suggests temporarily adding an extra 30 g of protein to your diet, which will make your body work harder and burn more calories. You could add a half-cup of cottage cheese (15 g) and 8 ounces of low-fat yogurt (11 g), or 8 ounces of skim milk (8 g) and 3 ounces of tuna (22 g).<br /><br /><b>Sleep Well</b><br />Get at least 6 hours of sleep each night. ""Your body releases growth hormones after 6 hours of sleep, which is when your muscles actually get toned,"" Holland says. ""If you get enough rest to release those muscle-toning hormones, you'll be able to push harder the next day."" It's also important to add a slow day - possibly midweek - to give your muscles a break and a chance to grow even more. Go for a long walk or an easy jog instead of your usual tough routine.<br /><br /><b>Week Three </b><br /><br /><b>Kick in the Afterburners</b><br />Now's the time to burn as many calories as you can in your workout. Swap out another strength session and replace it with heavy-duty cardio, which will raise your heart rate. At this point, your time is best spent doing cardio since you've already built some muscle during weeks 1 and 2. <br /><br /><b>Try Not to Talk</b><br />If you can hold a conversation for 20 minutes while jogging, you're fine. But to speed up your metabolism, Dr. Deitrick advises going beyond your comfort zone, to the point where you can't talk. Use this as a way to raise interval intensity levels, too. Go hard enough so that you can't talk for 2 minutes, and slow down so that you can chat for 2 minutes. To burn the most fat and calories, go as hard as you can for as long as you can.<br /><br /><br /><b>Add Resistance </b><br />Amplify your intervals by adding resistance to make them harder. Holland suggests hill repeats - sprint up a hill and walk back down. Do five reps after a 5- to 10-minute warmup. You can also increase the incline on your treadmill or crank the knob on your spinning bike. <br /><br /><b>Extend Your Intervals</b><br />Do tempo runs, which are essentially long intervals, to maximize your calorie burn both during and after your workout. (The increased intensity keeps your metabolism higher for a longer post-exercise period.) Holland suggests running hard for 5 minutes and then jogging for 5 minutes. If you can, push yourself to go harder than your typical pace for 15 minutes. Incentive: If you run for 15 minutes at 7 mph (try this on a treadmill to note your speed), you'll burn about 180 calories versus the 110 you'd burn if you were jogging for the same time (based on a 140-pound woman). Jog for 10 minutes to warm up before your tempo run, and then for 10 minutes postrun to cool down. <br /><br /><b>Control Out-of-Control Hunger</b><br />When you're exercising harder, you'll feel hungrier postworkout. Dr. McDermott suggests drinking a protein and fruit smoothie after your workouts. Store peeled bananas in the freezer (in Ziploc baggies) and buy flash-frozen berries. Once you get home, blend a banana, some berries, 8 ounces of plain low-fat yogurt, and a cup of low-fat milk to make an instant frozen smoothie - and instant gratification.<br /><br /><b>Keep Your Body Wondering</b><br />""Play with your work-to-rest ratios when doing intervals to keep your body guessing,"" says Gunnar Peterson, a celebrity trainer in Los Angeles. When your body can't adapt to your plan, it's forced to work harder, so you're always working in your fat-burning capacity. Peterson suggests ""undulating"" your intervals: For example, run or pedal hard for 2 minutes, and then rest for 30 seconds. Go hard again for 2 minutes, and then rest for 1 minute. Extend your rest periods by 30 seconds until you reach 2 minutes, and then work your way back to 30-second rest periods, clipping 30 seconds at a time. <br />",Work It Off

Chef Candice Kumai has found a whole new way to get lean, energized, and healthy-with food!<br /><br />Her first cookbook, <i>Pretty Delicious: Lean and Lovely Recipes for a Healthy, Happy New You</i> is a beautiful, mouthwatering, and healthy collection of satisfying breakfasts, elegant apps, and hearty comfort foods, all low in calories and ""bad"" fats and loaded with good-for-you FWBs (Foods with Benefits) that make every bite count toward a healthier you.<br /><br />A former fit model-turned chef, Kumai has figured out how to satisfy her love for delicious, flavorful food while taking it easy on her waistline and wallet. Previously co-hosting Lifetime's <i>Cook Yourself Thin</i>, and currently appearing on TLC's <i>Home Made Simple</i> and the Cooking Channel's <i>Unique Eats</i>, she now serves up her deliciously slim secrets to fellow foodies full-time! And trust us, we've served up plenty of dishes from <i>Perfectly Delicious</i> around the <i>Women's Health</i> office! Since we are always up for healthy seconds, we chatted with Kumai about her food philosophy-and how you can make it (and every bite) work for you:<br /><br /><b>Why is it important for women to put the comfort back in their food?</b><br />I definitely believe that comfort and joy are two feelings that we should always associate with food! It's all about those memories that we create through the real, simple, and delicious foods that we cook. Somewhere along the spectrum of ""conventional foods"" and our insanely packed schedules, we lost touch with what real food is and, my goodness, we forgot how to enjoy food and each others' company. We are so accustomed to nuking up a frozen meal, heating a toaster pastry, opening a bag of chips, that we don't think twice about all of the additives, chemicals, preservatives, and extra nonsense we are consuming. It's not good for us or our health. It's time to get back to cooking. It's time to get that warm joy that crisp white pizza with mushrooms and artichokes and those freshly baked chocolate chip oatmeal cookies. It's time to get your family, your health, and your food back to the table. <br /><br /><b>What's your favorite comfort food?</b><br />Oh wow, so much to choose from. Honestly? I'm so San Diego at heart, I'm going to have to say an indulgent large breakfast burrito with eggs, sautéed mushrooms, sautéed bell peppers, slow cooked onions, breakfast hash potatoes, topped with a little cheese, fresh salsa, and avocado. Don't forget the hot sauce! Okay, now that is heaven in a tortilla and I'll be the first one to admit all things in moderation are so worth it! A little splurge after a long surf or a good run is always a nice treat to stay well balanced and realistic. <br />Check out page 29 of <i>Pretty Delicious</i> to learn how to make ""El Ultimo Brekkie Burrito Bar"" for you and all of your fabulous friends! <br /><br /><b>'Fess up! Do you count calories?</b><br />I actually am totally against calorie counting. I think it defeats the purpose of enjoying your food and creates this restrictive, unrealistic approach to eating and living a healthy lifestyle. If we constantly have to count, it makes food seem like a mathematical equation. And I absolutely hated math class. Now, I completely comprehend that a balanced lifestyle is actually a mathematical equation, but who wants to be constantly tortured to live their life off of points, numbers, and equations forever?<br /><br /><b>What ingredients do you avoid at all costs?</b><br />I try to stay away from anything that's heavily processed and chemical-laden. I'm not a fan of processed junk that claims to be fat free, low-fat, low-carb, no-carb, sugar-free, diet...you get the pattern here. I am always amazed at how clever marketing has become. It's like 100 calories of processed foods are a better solution!? No way! My rule of thumb? If you can't pronounce it, don't buy it!<br /><br /><b>What's your number-one tip for women who adore food and still want to lose weight?</b><br />Keep it real. Get back into cooking, eating, loving, and indulging in real foods again! We all tend to slip up when we are put on restrictive, unrealistic, and money-wasting diets. And the diet industry will have you running on a hamster wheel forever. Turn to real foods again; clear out your pantry, your fridge, get rid of the processed junk, and buy some real delicious fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, dried fruit, chocolate, and red vino-yes, I said chocolate and red vino!

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/the-science-behind-pain,Health,3,7,1,3,0,0,0,0,,The Science Behind Pain,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0703-sore-subject-1456.jpg,"Pain in the ass. <br />Painfully obvious. <br />Hurt feelings. <br />The truth hurts.<br /><br />We have plenty of colorful phrases to describe emotional pain, but cutting-edge science has revealed we're just scratching the surface when it comes to explaining - not to mention treating - the physical kind of <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/the-science-behind-pain-1"">pain</a>. A national survey found that 46 percent of women experienced pain every day, but only 39 percent felt they had any control over it. Pain, much like Andy Dick, has become an accepted nuisance. <br /><br />When confronted with throbbing temples, crippling cramps, a locked-up lower back, or overworked abs, we usually stop what we're doing and pop some Advil or grab an ice pack. Which is exactly what that <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/headache-causes-and-how-to-treat-them"">headache</a> or wrenched back is telling us to do. ""The purpose of pain is to grab your attention so that you'll fix the problem,"" says Scott M. Fishman, M.D., chief of the division of <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/how-to-choose-a-pain-killer"">pain medicine</a> at the University of California at Davis. It's the equivalent of turning the channel when you catch Andy Dick on a <i>Celebrity Poker Showdown</i> rerun.<br /><br />The catch is that channel changing doesn't always work. Americans spend about $4 billion a year on over-the-counter pain-relief products, but 75 million of us still live with discomfort. And researchers have recently found that chronic pain can actually damage your brain, resulting in even more serious health problems.<br /><br />Lucky for us, researchers are also making giant leaps in soothing ouches and easing agony - including new treatments designed for women. The emerging science about how we process and interpret pain signals has far-reaching implications for the diagnosis and management of everything from headaches to <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/breast-cancer-survivors"">cancer</a>. So before you swallow another aspirin or ""just walk it off,"" learn what science is teaching us about how to handle our hurts. <br /><br /><b>Pain's Path </b><br /><br />Until recently, what we knew about how the mind and body process pain was pretty straightforward. Think of your brain as a radio station that's usually tuned to Coldplay. Then you cut your thumb slicing a day-old bagel. The ""station"" switches to Linkin Park: Signals from nerve endings in your mangled thumb rush up to your thalamus, the part of the brain that decides what to do with pain signals (see graphic below). After interpreting the pulses as ""pain!"" the thalamus routes the signal to the brain regions that figure out how to react: the cerebral cortex, a thought center that assesses the damage and determines a course of action, and the limbic system, where emotional responses are processed. In nanoseconds, your brain determines how high to crank the volume on that new ""song"" so you can react appropriately - in this case, it sends you a speaker-shaking alert to drop the knife.<br /><br />At the same time, the skin around the cut releases chemicals such as prostaglandins (hormone-like substances) and bradykinin (a protein) to make the injured spot even more sensitive so you'll protect that area. Your body's cleanup crew rushes in white blood cells to fight infection and extra fluid from the lymph nodes to flush out the microscopic trash generated in the process. That's why a painful area, just like Oprah's bank account, swells easily. <br /><br />The best part: Your nervous system is busy churning out powerful natural painkillers called endorphins so you can cope. (This explains how some people manage to hobble for help even with a broken leg.) Being able to ignore the pain for a short time is a leftover benefit from our cavewoman days when we needed to fight or flee, even in blinding agony - or risk ending up as saber-toothed tiger chow. <br /><br /><b>Pain is Personal</b><br /><br />The new view of how pain pathways in the body work is a bit more complex. While the basic process is the same, each person has a slightly different reaction, and therefore different tolerance, to pain signals. So the same injury can feel like Coldplay to some of us and Linkin Park to others. ""If you have two people with sprained ankles and one says, 'It's no big deal,' while the other says, 'It's the worst pain of my life,' it turns out both of them are telling the truth,"" says pain researcher Michael S. Gold, Ph.D., an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. ""Brain imaging shows that when someone says it really hurts, it does. Human pain response is influenced by a whole host of psychological, genetic, and biological factors."" <br /><br />So you're not imagining things if you often feel your latte is scalding or think pedicures are torture while your friends enjoy both. And you're not being dramatic if menstrual cramps have you doubled over in agony. Groundbreaking research points to the idea that pain is a unique experience for each person. In a 2003 study at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center, researchers scanned the brains of women and men while heat patches attached to their legs were cranked up to a searing 120 degrees Fahrenheit. The least sensitive person rated the pain a 1 out of 10, but the sensitive people said it was closer to a 9. MRI scans showed that the sensitive people's brains were more active in areas important for pain processing. ""Until now, there was no objective evidence that could confirm that these individual differences in pain sensitivity are, in fact, real,"" says lead researcher Robert C. Coghill, Ph.D., a Wake Forest neurobiologist.<br /><br />Your genes probably play a big role in how much things like cramps, headaches, and back pain hurt, says Jeffrey S. Mogil, Ph.D., a pain genetics researcher at McGill University in Montreal. In fact, British researchers just discovered a genetic mutation that blocks the perception of pain in some individuals. Mogil also notes animal research showing that anywhere from 30 to 75 percent of differences in pain sensitivity may be genetic. So if your mom screamed when she stubbed her toe on a table leg or was unfazed by a bee sting, you may react the same way. That could be true for how well we respond (or don't) to painkillers too.<br /><br />But other factors can influence how much pain you feel. Your expectations, for example. You know those annoying Pollyannas who keep saying that if you expect the best, you'll get it? Well, when it comes to pain, they're right. In a follow-up Wake Forest study using 122 degree heat pads, researchers sometimes told subjects to expect mild discomfort, and other times warned them to prepare for the worst. When participants anticipated less pain, they said they suffered significantly less than when faced with impending doom. Pain-related brain activity went down, and reports of pain decreased by 28 percent - relief as powerful as swallowing a dose of prescription-strength painkillers. <br /><br />So you won't be surprised to hear that happy thoughts help with pain tolerance too. A University of Wisconsin study found that when volunteers plunged an arm into ice water after reading uplifting, neutral, or depressing statements, the happy group dealt much better. Listening to enjoyable music boosted pain tolerance in another study. Predictably, doing math problems didn't.<br /><br />Knowing about this stuff can help you reduce the ouch in all kinds of ways. For example, bring your iPod along when you're doing time in the gyno's stirrups. Don't worry, you don't have to crank Hilary Duff bubblegum tunes. Studies show that listening to anything you like, even if it's the Decemberists, does the trick. You can also practice a type of meditation called guided imagery, where you imagine yourself in a (you guessed it) happy situation, like getting your toenails painted by Patrick Dempsey. Research shows that people who do relaxation therapy can reduce their pain levels by up to 50 percent.<br /><br /><b>Pain Picks Sides</b><br /><br />If you've ever nursed a boyfriend through the flu, you know that women are tougher than men when it comes to pain. Except that we're really not. Studies show we feel more pain, more often, and for longer periods of time than guys do. Yet another ice-water experiment (what's the deal with pain researchers and ice water, anyway?) had 62 people stick their hands in the freezing liquid - and the women tended to pull out first. Add to that the fact that 72 percent of chronic pain sufferers are women. <br /><br />In studying female pain, it's estrogen that often grabs researchers' attention. Neuroscientists from the University of Michigan somehow got 28 volunteers to agree to have saltwater injected into their jaw muscles. When they scanned the women's brains, they found those who had low estrogen levels (the hormone begins to plummet in the 10 to 14 days between ovulation and menstruation) produced way fewer pain-numbing endorphins than those with higher levels. What does this mean? (Other than that some people will do anything for money.) It means we're ridiculously wimpy during the last week of our cycle but pretty tough in the middle. So schedule those bikini waxes 2 weeks before your period and avoid the dentist right after. <br /><br /><b>Painkilling Rx</b><br /><br />At some point, though, you're gonna need drugs. Want the biggest guns? Those are opioids, such as the notoriously potent codeine, Demerol, morphine, oxycodone, and Vicodin, all available only by prescription. Like Pamela Anderson on a skuzzy rock star, opioids nuzzle right up to the same cell receptors where natural endorphins dock. They also stimulate the pleasure centers of the brain, which is why they're so effective - and so addictive.<br /><br />That's the reason doctors usually want you to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen and aspirin, instead. NSAIDs work by cutting down your body's production of prostaglandins, chemicals that cause inflammation and make you more sensitive to pain. What about acetaminophen (Tylenol)? Believe it or not, doctors aren't sure how it works - just that it seems to raise your pain threshold and lower your temperature to relieve fever. Newer meds designed to treat migraines, such as triptans (Amerge and Imitrex), work via a one-two punch: They reduce inflammation and constrict blood vessels to ease pain. (For what to take for which ache, see ""<a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/article/0,6176,s1-3-70-1459-1,00.html"">Sweet Relief</a>"".)<br /><br />Because we experience pain differently than guys do, it's not much of a shock that our bodies have distinct responses to these painkillers too. ""Each sex has slightly different wiring for pain,"" Mogil says. Studies in rats show that males respond better than females to opioids like morphine. But in human studies, when patients in the hospital administered their own pain meds, men used 50 percent more than women. And when researchers tested painkillers on volunteers who had just had a molar yanked, three opioid drugs - butorphanol, nalbuphine, and pentazocine - worked magically for the women but actually made the men more sensitive (oops!). <br /><br />Wouldn't it be great if we had drugs just for us - drugs that focused specifically on the pain wiring of female brains? There are two, in fact. The woman-specific prescription drug Zelnorm was approved in 2002 to relieve the pain of irritable bowel syndrome. (Doctors don't know why, but it has less effect on men.) And last year, the makers of the prescription triptan drug Frova applied to the FDA to have it approved for the prevention of menstrual migraines. Frova stays in the body longer than other triptan drugs, so it may have a better chance of stopping headaches that can occur when meds usually wear off. Drugs like these are just the start; expect to see more women-only meds in the next 10 years.<br /><br /><b>Pain That Stays</b><br /><br />Plenty of people will tell you the worst kind of pain, like that lizard with the accent in those Geico commercials, is the kind that just won't go away. That makes chronic pain a big concern for researchers. Over time, almost any nerve and muscle damage - from a torn hamstring to a strained back - has the potential to change how your nerves and even your brain work. That's especially true if the pain is long term. <br /><br />What happens is that nerves designed to respond to everyday sensations not related to pain can get recruited into the pain-sensing system. Your tolerance drops, and your sensitivity increases; even the slightest touch can become agonizing, and areas that weren't damaged begin to hurt. This process, called central sensitization, creates a ""pain groove"" that continues and magnifies the ache long after the original injury has healed. Your body is sending real pain signals even though nothing overt is causing them. That can make a wide variety of problems - including back pain and fibromyalgia (a chronic fatigue and pain syndrome) - much worse. <br /><br />Chronic pain also raises your odds of depression. What's more, it can literally steal your mind. In a 2004 study, MRI scans revealed that the brains of subjects suffering from chronic back pain had up to 11 percent less gray matter than those without the pain; it was as if their brains had aged an additional 10 to 20 years. That may be because the neurons recruited to cope with pain are overused and die sooner. ""It's a terrible thing when your pain alarm system is broken and won't turn off,"" Dr. Fishman says. ""Pain goes from being a symptom to becoming a chronic disease that can undermine your life, just like heart disease or diabetes."" <br /><br />Scary stuff. But for most of us, there's an easy way to avoid this worst-case scenario: Take your pain seriously, right from the start, and get help immediately - even if you're worried people will think you're a whiner. It's crucial to let a doctor know the intensity of your aches. Often pain can be eased, especially when caught early. Which reveals perhaps the most powerful lesson to emerge from all of this new pain research: ""Don't try to be tough. Don't try to live with it,"" Gold says. ""If you think you're feeling too much pain, you're right. There's no need to second-guess yourself."" Something hurts? Say ouch! It's not a cry of surrender, and you're not a wimp. It's a smart 21st-century health strategy.<br />",You and Improved

""Most people don't realize that because missionary allows for a lot of variation, it exposes your nerves to a wider range of sensations and is surprisingly orgasm-friendly,"" says Lori Buckley, Psy.D., a licensed sex therapist in Pasadena, California. Which explains why 33 percent of women say missionary is their favorite position, according to a recent study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. (Guys dig it too-being on top typically lets them control the pace and prolong their orgasm.) Amp up the experience with these hot new twists to the carnal classic.</p><p><strong>Rock the Boat</strong><br />Missionary gets flack for not allowing for much clitoral contact, but one simple adjustment can remedy that. Experts call it ""the coital alignment technique"" (a.k.a. ""the cat""). While he's on top of you, have him scoot up two inches so that the base of his penis is directly aligned with your clitoris, says sex therapist Ian Kerner, Ph.D., author of <em>She Comes First</em>. Then, with your legs wrapped around his thighs, press your genitals together so you create pressure and counterpressure, moving in a gentle rocking motion (as opposed to in and out). Your clitoris will let you know when you've got it right.</p><p><strong>Go Deep</strong><br />While he's on top, draw your knees toward your chest (you can grab the back of your thighs for support) and place one or both of your feet flat on his chest. ""Doing so puts the tip of his penis in direct contact with your cervix, a sensation many women find pleasurable,"" says Sadie Allison, D.H.S., author of <em>Ride 'Em Cowgirl</em>.</p><p><strong>Take Control</strong><br />Just because you're on the bottom doesn't mean you can't call the shots. Throw one of your legs over his shoulder while you keep the other one stretched straight out on the bed (or bent, with your foot planted firmly on the mattress). At your own pace, keep switching your legs so that one is over his shoulder and the other is on the bed. The up-and-down motion of your legs creates a pleasurable sweeping sensation over the G-spot zone, says Kerner.</p><p><strong>Bring Him to His Knees</strong><br />Awaken a whole new set of nerves by tweaking the angle of penetration. ""Lie down and have your guy kneel between your legs while sitting back so that his butt is resting on his ankles,"" suggests certified sex educator Lou Paget, author of <em>The Great Lover Playbook</em>. ""He can use the strength of his thighs to push forward and thrust, or grab your hips with his hands to control the pace."" This position stimulates your lower vaginal wall, which contains nerves that are often neglected during plain old missionary. If orgasm still eludes you, grab a vibrator or squeeze a little lube onto your fingertips and give yourself a hand as he thrusts.</p><p><strong>Straighten Up</strong><br />It sounds counterintuitive, but keeping your legs closed can actually boost your pleasure. Once he's inside you, bring your legs together (keep them straight) so that his legs are on the outside of yours. Then squeeze your thighs together to create friction against his shaft and your vaginal lips while he grinds (not thrusts) into your goods. ""The entrance to the vagina-namely the outer and inner labia-is packed with nerve endings that are activated by this type of shallow penetration,"" says Allison. You can also reach back and grab your headboard or place your palms against the wall for even more resistance and friction.</p><p><strong>Give Yourself Props</strong><br />The hottest sex toy is sitting right there on your bed. ""Place a pillow under your lower back to tilt your vagina upward,"" says Paget. ""His penis will hit that top frontal wall where the G-spot is located."" For extra pleasure, try placing your palms on his butt to control the pace and rhythm of movement.</p>",

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/lose-belly-fat,Fitness,3,6,3,79,2,3,7,0,,Why It's So Important to Lose Belly Fat,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/lose-belly-fat_0.jpg,"<p>The average American is carrying around about 30 billion fat cells. Abdominal fat bears the blame for many health problems because it resides within striking distance of your heart, liver, and other organs-pressing on them, feeding them poisons, and messing with their daily function.<br /><br />A Canadian study of more than 8,000 people found that over 13 years, the people with the weakest abdominal muscles had a death rate more than twice as high as those with the strongest midsections. Such research upholds the notion that flat stomachs do more than turn heads at the beach. In fact, your abdominal muscles control more of your body than you may even realize-and have just as much substance as show.<br /><br />A defined midsection, in many ways, has defined fitness. But it also defines something else: A flat stomach is the hallmark of people in control of their bodies and, as such, in control of their health.</p><p><strong>Reason 1: Lose Belly Fat, Live Longer</strong><br />Study after study shows that the people with the largest waist sizes have the most risk of life-threatening disease. The evidence couldn't be more convincing. According to the National Institutes of Health, a waistline larger than 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women signals significant risk of heart disease and diabetes. </p><p>Of course, finding your abs doesn't guarantee you a get-out-of-the-hospital-free card, but studies show that by developing a strong abdominal section, you'll lose body fat and significantly cut the risk factors associated with many diseases, not just heart disease. For example, the incidence of cancer among obese patients is 33 percent higher than among lean ones, according to a Swedish study. The World Health Organization estimates that up to one-third of cancers of the colon, kidney, and digestive tract are caused by being overweight and inactive. And having an excess of belly fat is especially dangerous. See, cancer is caused by mutations that occur in cells as they divide. Fat tissue in your abdomen spurs your body to produce hormones that prompt your cells to divide. More cell division means more opportunities for cell mutations, which means more cancer risk.</p><p><strong>Reason 2: Lose Belly Fat, Improve Your Sex Life</strong><br />Women claim the greatest sex organ is the brain; men say it's approximately 3 feet due south. So let's say we split the geographic difference and focus on what's really central to a good sex life. </p><p>You know the old phrase ""It's not the size of the ship; it's the motion of the ocean""? Well, take that to heart. You can rebuild your body to maximize the rocking and rolling that goes on below decks. Consider how the following side benefits can help you pull that ship into harbor. </p><p>The thrusting power you generate during sex doesn't come from your legs, it comes from your core. Strong abdominal and lower-back muscles give you stamina and strength to try new positions (or stay steady in old ones), so that sex is as pleasurable as it should be.</p><p><strong>Reason 3: Lose Belly Fat, Stay Safe from Harm</strong><br />Think of your midsection as your body's infrastructure. You don't want a core constructed of dry, brittle wood or straw and mud. You want a midsection made of solid steel, one that will give you a foundation of protection that belly fat never could. </p><p>Consider a US Army study that linked powerful abdominal muscles to injury prevention. After giving 120 artillery soldiers the standard army fitness test of situps, pushups, and a 2-mile run, researchers tracked the soldiers' lower-body injuries (such as lower-back pain, Achilles tendinitis and other problems) during a year of field training. The 29 soldiers who cranked out the most situps (73 in 2 minutes) were five times less likely to suffer lower-body injuries than the 31 who barely notched 50. But that's not the most striking element. Those soldiers who performed well in the pushups and the 2-mile run enjoyed no such protection--suggesting that good upper-body strength and cardiovascular endurance had little effect on keeping bodies sound. It was abdominal strength that offered the critical protection. Unlike any other muscles in your body, a strong core affects the functioning of the entire body. Whether you ski, do yard work, or carry the kids away from the candy aisle, your abs are the most essential muscles for keeping you from injury. The stronger they are, the stronger-and safer-you are.</p><p><strong>Reason 4: Lose Belly Fat, Strengthen Your Back</strong><br />Because most back pain is related to weak muscles in your trunk, maintaining a strong midsection can help resolve many back issues. The muscles that crisscross your midsection don't function in isolation; they weave through your torso like a spiderweb, even attaching to your spine. When your abdominal muscles are weak, the muscles in your butt and along the backs of your legs have to compensate for the work your abs should be doing. The effect, besides promoting bad company morale for the muscles picking up the slack, is that it destabilizes the spine and eventually leads to back pain and strain-or even more serious back problems.</p><p><strong>Reason 5: Lose Belly Fat and Win!</strong><br />If you run, bike, play naked Twister, or do any sport that requires movement, your essential muscle group isn't your legs or arms. It's your core-the muscles in your torso and hips. Developing core strength gives you power to perform. It fortifies the muscles around your whole midsection and trains them to provide the right amount of support when you need it. </p><p>So if you're weak off the serve, strong abs will improve it. If you also play sports where you run a lot, whether it's tennis or tag, abs can improve your game tremendously. That's because speed is really about accelerating and decelerating. How fast can you go from a stopped position at one baseline to stopping at the other baseline? Your legs don't control that; your abs do. When researchers studied what muscles were the first to engage in these types of sports movements, they found that the abs fired first. The stronger they are, the faster you'll get to the ball.</p><p><strong>Reason 6: Lose Belly Fat, Limit Your Aches and Pains</strong><br />As you age, it's common to experience some joint pain--most likely in your knees, hips, and back. Getting older can trigger soreness around your feet and ankles, too. The source of that pain might not be weak joints; it might be weak abs-especially if you do any kind of exercise, from serious tennis playing to walking every morning. When you're doing any type of athletic activity, your abdominal muscles help stabilize your body during start-and-stop movements, like changing direction on the tennis court or in kickboxing class. If you have weak abdominal muscles, your joints absorb all the force from those movements. </p><p>It's kind of like trampoline physics. Jump in the center, and the mat will absorb your weight and bounce you back in the air. Jump toward the side of the trampoline, where the mat meets the frame, and you'll bust the springs. Your body is sort of like a trampoline, with your abs as the center of the mat and your joints as the supports that hold the mat to the frame. If your abs are strong enough to absorb some shock, you'll function well. If they're not strong enough to help cushion the vibrations, the force puts far more pressure on your joints than they were built to withstand.</p><p><strong>Reason 7: Lose Belly Fat, Sleep Better</strong><br />Having a big belly and a fatty neck can trigger chronic, loud snoring and its partner, a sleep disorder called sleep apnea. People who have sleep apnea literally stop breathing for a few seconds to more than a minute sometimes hundreds of times a night, disrupting their slumber. They end up feeling exhausted the next morning. Losing weight can often help remedy the problem so you can get a better night's sleep. Exercise helps, too. Australian researchers found that people who lifted weights three times a week for 8 weeks experienced a 23 percent improvement in their sleep quality. If stress is what's causing restless nights, exercise is one of the best things you can do to stop worries from keeping you up. In one study, Texas A&M University scientists found that the fittest people exhibited lower levels of stress hormones in their bloodstreams than subjects who were least fit.</p>",

My advice is, if you want a healthier household, make gradual changes, or you're all going to rebel.<br /><br /><b>Isn't it OK to rebel once in a while? Nobody's perfect.</b><br /> Jillian Michaels: We all make choices: Am I going to have a glass of wine or not? Will I go to the gym? It's a commitment you have to renew every single day. But the payoff is worth it. And there is room to rebel in moderation. I give my team one high-calorie day a week. <br /><br /><b>What's the biggest misconception about dieting?</b><br /> Harper: Eating healthy doesn't mean deprivation. You can't go to the gym on an empty stomach; you need fuel for an effective workout. Have a few hundred calories, maybe an apple with a tablespoon of <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/premium-packaged-foods?cat=9782&tip=9990"">peanut butter</a>, half a protein shake, or a bowl of oatmeal, and you'll see better results. You've got to eat to lose weight. <br /><br /><b>What piece of gym equipment gives you the best workout? </b><br />Michaels: The <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/butt-blasting-cardio"">StairMaster</a>--it forces you to do resistance and cardio simultaneously, which is really hard.</p><p><br />Harper: I can train anyone with a medicine ball and a mat. But trying something new challenges your body and keeps you from getting bored. I like the TRX system (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.fitnessanywhere.com"">fitnessanywhere.com</a>). The balance required involves your entire core. <br /><br /><b>Alright, drill sergeant, give us your best excuse-buster. </b><br />Michaels: Genes are not static. Don't tell me, ""I was born fat."" No, you weren't. It might be harder for you than for other people, but you can radically change your metabolism, your wellness, and your immunity by how you live and what you put in your body. Accept that, and you'll feel more empowered.</p><p><b><i> </i></b></p><p><b><i>Get inspired to get in shape!

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/anna-torv-interview,Life,21,6,0,12,0,2,0,0,,A Conversation with Anna Torv,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0812-anna-troy.jpg,"<p>You've gotta love a straight-shooting Aussie chick. Take the latest wonder from Down Under, Anna Torv. Newfound stardom in the U.S.--she plays FBI agent Olivia Dunham on the Fox sci-fi series <i>Fringe</i>--hasn't turned the actress into the kind of Master Cleansing, rabbit-food-nibbling, body-obsessed waif that's become all too common on the small screen. In fact, she says, ""To be really honest, I don't love the gym.""</p><p>But that's OK, because the 30-year-old actress is getting quite a <a href=""/fitness/workouts"">workout</a> on her new show, ""running about"" the set with costar Joshua Jackson as they chase down clues to government conspiracies. ""There's a lot of manhandling of bad guys, which is great fun,"" she says. ""I love being physical, but I don't have any desire to prove myself. My character uses her feminine wiles, too. I'm interested in keeping that side of it real.""</p><p>Like fellow Aussie Cate Blanchett, Torv gives off a grounded vibe. Raised by a <a href=""/life/single-moms"">single mother</a> in the town of Matrabar, on Australia's Gold Coast, she spent her teenage years surfing, camping, and riding horses--whatever kept her outdoors. ""My friends and I would get up early and take our horses through the national forest,"" she says. ""My mom was very free. It was always 'Out of the house!' There was no watching television on weekends.""</p><p>Since then, Torv has racked up an impressive list of acting credits. After graduating from Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art in 2001, she did Shakespeare on tour with the Sydney Theatre Company, then appeared on several TV shows in her homeland. A relative newcomer to Hollywood, Torv--who is rumored to have beaten out more than 300 hopefuls for her Fringe role--isn't about to buy into the pressure to be perfect. ""I work in an industry where everyone is flawlessly beautiful, but I just want to be healthy,"" she says. ""I had a fantastic mother who taught me self-confidence. I feel good about who I am.""</p><p>Torv revealed to <i>WH</i> the rest of her feel-good formula--including a pain-free fitness regimen, tips for winding down after a stressful day, and a homemade recipe for glowing skin.</p><p><b>Practice the 10-yard stare.</b> ""When I'm stressed, I go for a walk--breathing deep and taking in the horizon. That's what Australians call a 10-yard stare. I go fast and squeeze my butt muscles as I walk. And every now and then, when I'm feeling tired, I'll go to my dressing room and do yoga stretches to get loose. Reading is another great way to de-stress; it takes me to another world. I'm salivating to start The Gathering, by Irish novelist Anne Enright.""</p><p><b>Use weekends wisely.</b> ""I'm a huge camper, and love hiking and mountain biking. Since my show is filmed in New York City, I've been able to go to the Hudson Valley, in upstate New York, on weekends. Recently, friends and I went to Mohonk Mountain House [in New Paltz] and walked around the lake and swam. Two days of that and you feel great. I wear Blundstones for hiking. They're like a work boot with a bit of grip, so you can wear them all day. They're quite groovy.""</p><p><b>Consider the alternative.</b> ""Homeopathic medicine works for me. I never get sick. I don't believe in taking multivitamins. Instead, I'll swallow a capsule of garlic oil, which is a blood purifier and an antioxidant, at night. I also take zinc, as well as vitamin C, every now and then. And if I'm about to do something really physical, I'll take magnesium. I also refer to the book Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom, by Christiane Northrup, again and again. I am an avid believer in the idea that menstrual cycles are a natural thing and that you shouldn't run from them. I've never been on the Pill.""</p><p><b>Feed your face.</b> ""Bad skin is the bane of my existence. One trick that makes my skin look good: Every morning, I grind fresh flaxseed, then mix it with yogurt and blueberries--all of which are good for the skin--and eat that. I'm also a fan of Dr. Nicholas Perricone's skin-care regimen. I followed it for a few months and my skin looked beautiful. It makes sense--using omega-3 oil and foods with healthy fats to make skin supple. When it comes to skin-care products, I use Alpha-H, an Australian line made with alpha-hydroxy acids [alpha-h.com]. I'm also an advocate of microdermabrasion. In an ideal world, I'd do it every two months.""</p><p><b>Shun the sun.</b> ""Like a lot of Australians of Irish or Scottish descent, the people in my family have fair complexions. I spend a lot of time in the sun, but I've never been burned, because my mom used to slap 30-plus sunscreen on me. Now I wear it every day. When we shoot outside for the show, I wear a hat. It's vanity: If I'm in the sun for a long time, my freckles pop up. In the '70s it was cool to have a tan. But thanks to women like Nicole Kidman, who never bought into the tanning thing, now pale skin looks elegant.""</p><p><b>Go easy on the glam.</b> ""On the show, I wear Clarins Tinted Moisturizer to cover my freckles. I mix that with a heavier foundation so I can alternate between lighter and heavier coverage. I also like Max Factor Pan-Stik, which I use as a concealer, dotting it along my T-zone. I don't love to have my freckles popping out, but I don't like to look like I'm wearing a mask, either. Another favorite is Tarte Cheekstain: It gives me a dewy look."" </p><p><b>Hit the snooze button.</b> ""If you take care of your body, your body will take care of you. But it's not just about working out or eating right--it's about knowing when to rest. I'm into energy conservation. If I have an 18-hour day ahead, I won't get up extra early. I conserve that energy so I'll feel strong at the end of the day. Our [filming] timetable is all over the place: Sometimes I start at four in the afternoon and work until four in the morning, so I grab a nap whenever I can.""<br /></p>",

As an Australian living in the U.S., have you spotted any differences between Aussie and American women?</b></i><br />Australian women tend to tell it like it is-even if it's the brutal, honest truth.

I do a lot of soft-sand running, hiking, yoga, and boxing, and I compete in triathlons. But I don't have a strict diet. If I want a beer, I'll have a beer, and I've always been a chocoholic. </p><p><i><b>5. Any hidden talents? </b></i><br />I'm undefeated in Scrabble.

Not anymore. More than 1 million people stepped up to a triathlon starting line last year-37 percent of them women, according to USA Triathlon. ""Triathlons have taken over the reins from marathons as the new personal challenge,"" says Barrie Shepley, Canada's former Olympic and National Triathlon Team coach.<br /><br />It's no mystery why: The swim-bike-run combo combats workout boredom and practically guarantees weight loss. Plus, the popular sprint distance (half-mile swim, 12-mile bike, and 3.1-mile run) eliminates intimidation. Just be forewarned: The feeling of accomplishment coupled with body-sculpting effects can be addictive!<p></p><p><b>Why Tri?</b><br />Watch any triathlon and you'll see lean legs, flat abs, and <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/arm-workout-0"">sculpted arms</a> whizzing by-all thanks to the one-two punch of endurance and resistance exercise. ""Conditioning your body to plug away at three back-to-back disciplines builds <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/muscle-workout"">muscle endurance</a>,"" says Lesley Mettler, a triathlon coach in Seattle.<br /><br />""The resistance comes from pushing yourself through water, which is thicker than air, and cycling up hills or into wind. Triathlon training is very balanced-it's whole-body training.""</p><p>And it shows. When you focus exclusively on one sport, you often end up strong in some areas and soft in others. Triathletes get body benefits from all three sports and are lean and fit from head to toe, says exercise physiologist Shannon Grady, owner of Go! Athletics. Plus, the constant cardio can result in serious weight loss.<br /><br />But all that cardiovascular action is good for more than just dropping a few pounds: A recent study in Radiology found that triathletes have larger, healthier hearts and a 17 percent lower heart rate (fewer beats means your ticker is so strong it doesn't have to work as hard) than other athletes.<br /><br />Your joints, tendons, and muscles will thank you too. ""Overuse injuries like tendinitis and stress fractures often result from weakness elsewhere in the body,"" explains Jordan Metzl, M.D., a sports medicine specialist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City and an eight-time Ironman finisher. ""Because of the amount of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/best-fitness-shoes-cross-train"">cross-training</a>, triathletes build stronger muscles around all of their joints, which reduces their injury risk,"" he says. ""Think of it as building scaffolding around a building.""</p><p>A stronger body and better health starts with this step-by-stroke-by-pedal plan.</p><p></p><p><b>RELATED:</b> <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/triathlon-training-plan"">12-Week Triathlon Training Plan</a></p><br /><b>Swimming</b><br />There's a reason even fit women end up hanging onto the side of the pool when they first start doing laps. ""In swimming, you use every single one of your muscles to stay afloat and work through the tension of the water,"" says Pete McCall, exercise physiologist with the American Council on Exercise. ""And since those muscles need oxygen and fuel, your body is asked to work harder."" But have no fear! Once you get your feet (and the rest of you) wet, you'll build endurance fast and quickly learn to love this soothing, no-impact workout that burns more than 500 calories an hour.<br /><br /><b>Technique 101</b><br /><i>Breathe.</i><br />""It's the single most important thing to master in swimming,"" says Shepley. A steady inhale/exhale rhythm keeps you relaxed (like in yoga) while increasing your speed and eliminating the need to gasp for air every couple of strokes. Breathe out of your nose while your face is in the water and, on every other stroke, tilt your head to the side, halfway out of the water, and take in oxygen. Once you're comfortable with that, breathe in on every third stroke to practice getting air on both sides-a handy skill in open water since waves may break on your favored side.<br /><br /><i>Roll with it.</i><br />Rotate your shoulders, torso, and hips with each stroke to help you glide through the water. ""If you rotate your body from side to side-rather than swimming flat-you'll move like a torpedo,"" says Shepley. In other words, fast as hell.<br /><br /><i>Kick sparingly.</i><br />Save your legs for the bike and run, and rely mostly on your arms to pull you through the water. This prevents lactic acid from building up in your legs, which in turn keeps your legs from tiring so they're ready when you really need them. During training, squeeze a pool buoy between your legs as you swim to practice using your upper body.<br /><br /><b>Do It!</b><br />At first, aim to swim 250 meters once or twice a week. If you're sucking wind (or water), break it into intervals of 25 meters (usually one length of a pool) of nonstop swimming with 20 seconds of rest in between to catch your breath. During the final month, make one session each week an open-water swim, if possible, and practice sighting by looking up every six to eight strokes to confirm you're on course. Start each workout with 10 to 15 minutes of the following warmup drills. These three exercises from Shepley will refine your stroke and help you generate more power so you can learn to glide through the water effortlessly.<br /><br />Catch-up Drill (for stroke timing): Swim freestyle as usual, but leave one hand in front until your other hand finishes the stroke and comes around to ""tag"" it.<p></p><p>Side-Swim Drill (for body position): Hold your left hand in front of you, palm down. Swim with your left side, eyes looking at the bottom of the pool and right hand glued to your right thigh for six kicks. Stroke with your left hand, rotate, and switch sides. Repeat.</p><p>Fingertip Drag (for arm position): As each hand ends its stroke, keep your elbow high and carefully drag your fingertips along the surface as you bring your arm forward.</p><p></p><p><b>RELATED:</b> <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/triathlon-training-plan"">12-Week Triathlon Training Plan</a></p><b>Biking</b><br />Triathletes consider the relatively ""easy"" cycling leg child's play-after all, most people learned to ride when they were missing their two front teeth. And while the skill of bike riding does come right back, there are a few training tricks that will help you build lean muscle and pump the pedals on race day. With proper prep, those 12 miles will fly by faster than you think.<br /><br /><b>Technique 101</b><br /><i>Spin your wheels.</i><br />Your bike is powered by your legs and core, which means your upper body should be relaxed and motionless as your lower half does the work. Try not to hold tension up top.<br /><br /><i>Shift.</i><br />""Most beginners fall in love with one gear and don't shift as often as they should,"" says Jonathan Cane, head coach for City Coach Multisport in New York City. You want less resistance while going uphill, so shift down into a lower gear (your legs will spin faster and with less effort) to help you over a climb. Do the same whenever you come to a complete stop-starting again will feel 10 times easier in a low gear. On flat or downhill terrain, shift up to a harder gear to add resistance so you're not just coasting but powering through.<br /><br /><i>Pedal evenly.</i><br />A good pedal stroke should be about pulling as much as pushing-a complete circle of power and efficiency. And the smoothness will help your entire form: ""If you have a perfectly round pedal stroke, you'll notice your hips, shoulders, and torso are stationary,"" says Cane.<br /><br /><b>Do It!</b><br />If the last bike you rode was pink and had a basket on the front, start by taking a spin class or riding a stationary bike at your gym for 30 minutes. Do that two or three times a week to remind your muscles how to pedal before hitting the road. Once you're used to the gym bike, hop on a road bike twice a week for 30 minutes (to start). Just don't forget to vary your terrain-especially if you're prepping for a hilly racecourse.<br /><br /><p><b>RELATED:</b> <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/triathlon-training-plan"">12-Week Triathlon Training Plan</a></p><b>Running</b><br />Because running is the last leg of the race, your training goal is to build muscle endurance so you'll be able to finish strong when you're spent from swimming and biking. ""Since you have to bang out only a few miles on race day, your running training focuses on boosting your body's VO2 max, or its efficiency in using oxygen, to get you through all three legs,"" says McCall. ""And the best way to do that is by running shorter distances at higher intensities. In other words, intervals.""<br /><br /><b>Technique 101</b><br /><i>Shorten your stride.</i><br />Reducing your stride lessens the impact on your body, which cuts your injury risk and also keeps your feet happy because they're spending less time on the ground. Count the number of steps you take per minute and aim for 180 (or three steps per second) as your goal.<br /><br /><i>Run relaxed.</i><br />Bend your elbows to form 90-degree angles and make sure your fists aren't clenched. Keep your jaw loose and your shoulders down. During easy runs, you should be able to carry on a conversation. If you can't, slow down.<br /><br /><b>Do It!</b><br />Start the first month with 20-minute runs twice a week, increasing time or distance by no more than 10 percent each week. Smacks of slacking off? You're really not: Thanks to your bike and swim cardio, 20 minutes is all you need right now to stay fit, says Shepley. Adding two-minute speed intervals will strengthen your legs and build the power you'll need to finish strong on race day. Before you dash, warm up your running muscles with the three plyometrics moves below. Do each one for 10 to 15 steps, rest for 30 seconds, and repeat once.<br /><br />Walking Lunges: Step forward with your right foot and lower your body until both knees are bent 90 degrees, keeping your right knee behind your toes. Push off your front foot and switch legs, moving forward.<p></p><p>Butt Kicks: Run forward, kicking your feet directly behind your body so that your heels touch your butt.</p><p>Bounding: Run with an exaggerated stride length, lifting your front knee high with each bound.</p><p></p><p><b>RELATED:</b> <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/triathlon-training-plan"">12-Week Triathlon Training Plan</a></p><b>Get in Gear</b><br />Everything you'll need to rock the racecourse in style<br /><br /><i>Wet suit.</i><br />Sleeveless or full sleeve, your wet suit gives you an incredible buoyancy boost, helping to keep you horizontal (and warm!) in the water.

Not only is seafood a nutrient-packed source of protein it's one of the richest sources of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/good-fats""><b>omega-3 fatty acids</b></a>, the super-healthy polyunsaturated fat linked to fewer cases of heart disease, depression, stroke, and possibly even Alzheimer's and nonmelanoma skin cancer. On top of all that, seafood is slim on calories and artery-clogging saturated fat, and it's as easy to prepare as a pack of Ramen noodles. <br /><br />Despite the finer points of <a href=""http://recipes.womenshealthmag.com/homepage.aspx"">healthy seafood</a>, we still don't devour enough of it. Just one in four women eats two 4-ounce servings a week, the absolute minimum the American Heart Association recommends. Why isn't seafood on the menu more often? Aside from its often hefty price tag (which you can beat by buying the good stuff frozen), recent news reports about ""toxic seafood"" are enough to make tuna sound like a swimming bullet. Check out <i>WH</i>'s guide to safe seafood in <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/best-fish-for-the-environment""><b>""Market Analysis.""</b></a><br /><br />But don't believe the scary headlines. Many respected health experts agree that seafood is one of the best things you can put down your gullet. ""The benefits of fish are well established, while the risks are overblown,"" says Dariush Mozaffarian, M.D., assistant professor of medicine and epidemiology at Harvard Medical School and lead author of a 2006 article in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> (<i>JAMA</i>) that weighed the pros and cons of eating seafood. One positive finding: Adding just 3 to 6 ounces of fish to your diet every week, especially those high in two key omega-3 fatty acids - EPA and DHA - reduces the risk of death from a heart attack by a staggering 36 percent.<br /><br />According to Dr. Mozaffarian and his crew, omega-3s seep into the cell membranes of heart and blood vessels and help protect them against irregular heartbeats, blood clotting, and other disturbances that can cause heart attacks. The JAMA study concluded that we should all be getting an average of 250 milligrams of omega-3s daily to safeguard our tickers. And since fatty acids from fish are also crucial to an infant's developing brain - including vision, memory, and language comprehension - women considering kids should eat no less than four 3-ounce servings of seafood a week. <br /><br />On the flip side, many types of seafood do contain mercury - and at very high levels, mercury kills brain cells. We know this from studies of industrial accidents like one in Japan in the '50s, when a petrochemical company discharged heavy-metal waste into the ocean, poisoned the fish supply, and caused pregnant women who ate contaminated fish to bear children with damaged nervous systems. Megadoses of mercury can remain in your bloodstream for over a year. Still, getting mercury poisoning isn't easy - your body removes most of it naturally via the filtering action of your kidneys and other metabolic pathways. In order to rack up a dangerous amount of the toxin, you'd have to consume the most mercury-laden fish several times a month. Which fish are in that same sorry boat? Since large bodies soak up more chemicals than small ones, the victims include king mackerel, sharks, swordfish, tilefish, and whales.<br /><br />When a society does down tainted fish at the same ungodly rate Americans scarf junk food, the results seem to vary. One study of kids living in the Seychelles, a group of islands in the Indian Ocean where pregnant women eat an average of 12 fish meals per week, was reassuring. ""We've examined 700 children on six occasions over 16 years and haven't found adverse effects that are consistent with mercury consumption,"" says Gary Myers, M.D., a professor of neurology and pediatrics at the University of Rochester. He notes that seafood in the Seychelles has similar mercury levels to those of commercial fish eaten in New York. But an equally comprehensive study of children in the Faroe Islands, located between Norway and Iceland, produced worrisome results. Researchers found brain impairment due to high prenatal mercury exposure. One theory: In the Faroes, most mercury comes from whale meat eaten in large quantities during hunting season, which possibly causes a rush of mercury that the body takes much longer to flush. <br /><br />The other dark spot on seafood's shining reputation comes from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). These industrial chemicals were banned 30 years ago but hang around in the environment for decades. While animal studies have linked PCBs to cancer, it's unclear whether they cause the disease in humans. But Dr. Mozaffarian and colleagues hold firm that PCB levels in fish - which are considerably lower than in poultry or beef - are so minuscule that the cardiovascular benefits of seafood surpass the potential cancer risks several hundred times over.<br /><br />All that said, since brain damage and cancer are at stake here, it's still better to err on the side of caution. Luckily, the simple solution is to score your 250-milligram minimum of omega-3 fats from fish with as few toxins as possible.

My boyfriend, Jamel--who has as much mountain-biking experience as I have (uh, that would be zilch)--has already conquered the killer hill and is waving me on. This is my first real mountain-bike ride, and I'm about to face my biggest fear: losing control. </p><p>Searching for courage, I look up at the ceiling of leaves and branches about 30 feet above my head. Most urban playgrounds are carefully manicured versions of nature surrounded by skyscrapers that loom defiantly like extended middle fingers. But there are no towering buildings visible from the middle of Walnut Creek Metropolitan Park. This nearly 300-acre urban wilderness in northeastern Austin, Texas, is packed with zigzagging dirt-coveredtrails covering 16 miles. It's the perfect place to get lost--and, if I'm lucky, find myself. That's why I'm here on a sunny Saturday morning: Every now and then, when life gets too overscheduled and monotonous, I feel an overwhelming urge to do something totally insane--before I go insane. To recover, I cook up a wacky <a href=""/life/the-best-vacation-guide-books"">adventure trip</a> (like the time I hiked up a volcano). This time I've decided to don ­padded spandex.</p><p><b>Shock Absorbed</b><br />An hour ago, my mountain-­biking sensei, Vanessa Ford, 40, president of the Austin Flyers Cycling Club, served up a<a href=""/fitness/get-better-workout-results""> bike ride</a> crash course in the basics. Jamel and I learned how to pull up on the handlebars to jump over rocks, tree roots, and curbs. We practiced shifting our body weight back on descents. I even successfully tackled a few smaller hills and twists while pedaling at embarrassingly slow speeds. I may be an adventure junkie, but I'd rather not have to peel myself off the ground. </p><p>Gripping and regripping the handlebars, I start down a well-worn path. Within seconds, I'm plunging at what feels like 50 miles an hour. Freaked out by the speed and my trembling bike frame, I forget one of Ford's first lessons: Pick your line before you take it. I swerve too late to avoid a protruding tree root and hit it dead on. The collision sends a jolt from my heels to my teeth. My feet slip, and the sharp metal corner of my right pedal cuts into my calf. </p><p><b>Blazing Saddle</b><br />As a dotted trail of blood emerges on my stinging lower leg, I lead my bike back to the starting point, determined to do better. This time I pick my line, envision myself at the top of the far rise, and shove off. Pedaling intermittently, I flutter the brakes, hike my butt up off the saddle, and shift my weight back. With my body properly balanced, the bike suddenly feels as easy to handle as a steering wheel. I take a breath and enjoy the wind rushing past my skin. The ground comes up fast and I shoot up the first third of the incline like a pinball.</p><p>The rush lasts until about halfway up the climb. My momentum sputters and I start rolling backward (and break into a swearing streak). This is when I normally would lose my nerve and feel helpless. Miraculously, I don't. I grit my teeth and push with every ounce of strength in my glutes and quads. Ugh! I just can't... beat... gravity. I dismount with dignity and walk the last few feet to the top. When I flash Jamel a smile and look down the truly impressive incline, victory still feels sweet.</p><p>For the next few miles of trails, the turns are easier to navigate and I take them with more guts, bunny-hopping (the technique of rising off the saddle, leveling the pedals, then squatting and springing up) over small obstacles. Facing another serious downhill with a sharp 90-degree turn at its base, I wipe all fear from my mind and descend like a seasoned pro. OK, so I'm no Lance Armstrong (who happens to call this town home). But that was awesome.

""I was on a camping trip with my cousins,"" the 39-year-old Californian recalls. As the family sat around the campfire, her uncle lit a cigar. Intrigued by the sharp scent of the smoke, Emily persuaded him to let her try it. ""I took a huge puff and turned green,"" she says. ""That was it for me.""</p><p>Thirty years later, Emily was a picture of healthy living: She ran a family winery in Napa Valley with her husband, Dave, had two young daughters, and was <a href=""/fitness/start-running"">training for a half-marathon</a>. So the discovery that a deadly disease was ravaging her was nothing short of shocking.</p><p>It started out as <a href=""/health/conditions/back-pain"">back pain</a>, a recurring twinge. When an <a href=""/health/conditions/magnetic-resonance-imaging-mri"">MRI</a> showed a tumor on her spine and spots on her lungs, Emily and her oncologist assumed it must be <a href=""/health/breast-cancer-stories"">breast cancer</a> that had spread, a diagnosis not unknown in young, healthy women. No one was prepared for the <a href=""/health/conditions/biopsy"">biopsy</a> result, which showed that these were actually symptoms of lung cancer. It had metastasized to her spine.</p><p>The number of lung cancer deaths among American women has grown by 600 percent since 1950. The disease is highly fatal, killing more women each year than breast and all gynecologic cancers combined. Today, one in every 16 women will develop lung cancer. And though the increase in its incidence is most likely due to a surge in the number of women smokers, nonsmokers aren't immune, says Michael Thun, M.D., vice president emeritus and research director of epidemiology for the American Cancer Society. </p><p>""No one's risk is zero,"" Emily says emphatically. ""Look at me.""</p><p><b>Why Women Are Vulnerable</b><br />Three or four years ago, no one imagined that certain lung tumors might be thought of as ""women's cancers."" But in 2007, several groundbreaking studies connected lung cancer to the hormone estrogen. The studies found that on average, younger female lung cancer patients, who have lots of estrogen ­circulating through their bodies, have shorter life expectancies than postmenopausal patients. One study even found that some men with lung cancer also had comparatively high levels of estrogen.</p><p>Scientists theorize that the link between estrogen and lung cancer may be similar to the one already established between estrogen and breast cancer. More than a decade ago, experts realized that certain types of breast tumors feed on estrogen. Today, drugs that block the tumors from taking in the hormone have dramatically changed the course of the disease. Since 1990, five-year breast cancer survival rates for women under 70 have improved almost 40 percent. Now about 88 percent of women with breast cancer live for at least five years after their diagnosis, compared with just 15 percent of lung cancer patients. (This also has to do with the difficulty of lung cancer screening. You can't feel a lump in your lungs the way you can in your breast, and CT chest scans aren't effective enough to advise for widespread use. As a result, most cases aren't detected until they're in a late stage.) </p><p>Researchers have begun to focus their efforts on determining which kinds of tumors may be estrogen dependent, growing lung cancer cells in the lab and seeing how they respond to the hormone. Once they pinpoint whether certain tumors grow by siphoning estrogen, as they can do now with breast tumors, they should be able to treat them with estrogen-blocking drugs.</p><p><b>Why Nonsmokers Aren't Always Safe</b><br />Smoking remains by far the biggest risk factor for lung cancer, with smokers accounting for 85 to 90 percent of all cases. Yet researchers estimate that in 10 to 15 percent of cases, the patient has never lit up. </p><p>""We have to stop thinking of lung cancer as a smokers' disease,"" says Christina Baik, M.D., a hematology-oncology fellow at Tufts Medical Center. If lung cancer in nonsmokers were its own disease, it would be the sixth or seventh most deadly malignancy in America, killing up to 26,000 people a year. </p><p>Still, ""You can't help wondering, when you've never smoked and you've tried to be healthy all of your life, 'Why did this happen to me?'"" Emily says. Some scientists believe the answer may be embedded in our DNA.</p><p>In a recent landmark study funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute, investigators took samples of cancerous tissue from 188 lung cancer patients. They analyzed 623 genes that had been linked to other cancers and found 26 with repeated mutations that likely had jumpstarted the lung cancer. ""Within three or four years, a simple blood or saliva test may be able to tell whether you're genetically predisposed to lung cancer, just as doctors can now check for BRCA mutations [which indicate a predisposition for breast cancer],"" says James Rigas, M.D., an associate professor of medicine at Dartmouth Medical School and the medical director of the comprehensive thoracic oncology program at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. </p><p>""The dream is that the newest advances will bring us to the day when lung cancer can be found earlier and be much more survivable,"" says Laurie Carson, the founder of the Lung Cancer Research Foundation. ""We need lung cancer to become treatable, the way breast cancer is now for so many women.""</p><p>Emily has responded well to radiation and chemotherapy, perhaps thanks to her otherwise healthy lungs. ""I never believed that I would die of lung cancer,"" she says. ""Now I'm convinced [that I won't]."" She has returned to yoga and Pilates classes, walks the family's rows of grape vines with her two little girls, and plans, she says, to be the newest face of lung cancer: long-term survivor.</p>",Getting Started

But Julia Niles isn't thinking about falling or dying. She's thinking only of where she'll find the next handhold along the slick granite mountain wall. She's carrying just a hydration pack and a few energy bars. Her goal: to hike, scramble up, and climb the nearly vertical walls of the 10-mile, 10-peak Grand Traverse in a single day-solo. Most climbers take three days to make this climb, plus a load of gear and, often, a guide. Even more impressive: No woman has ever done this before. What makes it unbelievable: Six months ago, Julia couldn't even hike up a flight of stairs without <a href=""/health/diagnosing-allergies"">wheezing</a>-because she had just lost half a lung.</p><p>The coughing began in the summer of 2004, when Julia was working as a mountain-climbing guide in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It started out as little more than an annoying hack, but gradually morphed into a feeling that a rope was slowly being tightened around her chest.</p><p>Work demands and <a href=""/life/health-insurance-costs"">health insurance</a> problems-and no small amount of denial-kept Julia from getting a proper diagnosis for 18 months. By then, she was suffering near constant bouts of pneumonia and bronchitis and had trouble conquering a flight of stairs. A CT scan revealed a mass in her left lung, and a bronchoscopy identified the mass as a tumor completely blocking the airway into the lung's left lower lobe. To get rid of the tumor and find out whether it was malignant, doctors told her, they would need to remove the lung-and with it, her career. Julia was 25 years old. And mad as hell.</p><p>""I ripped out the IV and the sticky things and tried to walk out the door,"" she says. ""I was infuriated. I mean, I was a high-altitude mountain guide.""</p><p>So Julia sought a second opinion from John D. Mitchell, M.D., chief of thoracic surgery at the University of Colorado at Denver. He said that yes, removing the entire lung would be easier, but was not necessary. He suggested something more complex, called a sleeve lobectomy: He would remove the left lower lobe and reattach the left upper lobe to the main part of the lung.</p><p>The surgery took five and a half hours. A biopsy found that the mass was a carcinoid tumor of the lung. (Unlike the more common and deadly small cell lung <a href=""/health/prevent-cancer"">cancer</a>, carcinoid tumors are rare, tend to grow slowly, and don't usually spread beyond the lungs.) Because the tumor was completely removed, Julia's chance of a complete cure is 90 to 95 percent, with an extremely low likelihood of a recurrence, Mitchell says.</p><p>Two days before she left the hospital, Julia was walking; within two weeks, she was running and backcountry skiing despite having only about 75 percent of normal lung capacity. Three months later, she started climbing again. ""I had this theory about active rehab,"" she says. ""If I used my lungs as much as possible, maybe they'd expand."" The pain was excruciating at first, in part because the surgery required a rib to be broken. But any agony she felt couldn't top her excitement about being alive. She could do anything-even a furiously paced, equipment-free, epic solo climb. The kind of climb that no other fantastically fit, cancer-free female climber had ever accomplished.</p><p><b>Breathe Easier</b><br />Take these simple precautions to reduce your lung cancer risk</p><p><b>Quit smoking</b> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that only 46 percent of women who try to quit are successful.</p><p><b>If you don't light up, avoid people who do </b> Of the 3,000 people per year whose lung cancer deaths are attributed to the damage caused by secondhand smoke, two-thirds are women. Epidemiologists speculate that nonsmoking women may be more likely to tolerate men who light up than vice versa. Another theory is that women could have a higher genetic susceptibility to secondhand smoke than men do. Whatever the explanation, keep away from other people's poisons.</p><p><b>Have your home tested for radon </b> This odorless gas, which slinks up through the floorboards, is believed to be the second most common environmental cause of lung cancer (cigarette smoke is No.1). It may account for many of the cases in nonsmokers. The Environmental Protection Agency has more info about radon and testing options at <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.epa.gov/radon"">epa.gov/radon</a>.</p><p><b>Eat more plants </b> Research shows that piling your plate with antioxidant-loaded fruits and vegetables can protect against almost all forms of cancer. A 2008 study found that cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli can be especially effective at reducing smokers' lung cancer risk. On the flip side, an animal study last year found that consuming lots of inorganic phosphates (additives commonly found in processed foods) can actually spur lung tumor growth.</p><p><b>Know the early symptoms</b> If you have a cough that won't go away and it's accompanied by shortness of breath and fatigue that also lingers, see your doctor. You probably have bronchitis or allergies, but in rare instances, these can be symptoms of lung cancer.</p>",Getting Started

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/money-and-women,Life,2,6,4,4,0,0,1,0,,Money Tips from Jean Chatzky,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/money-tips-art_0.jpg,"<p>It's obvious to any woman who has spent more than five minutes talking to a man that the two sexes are not wired the same way. And over the past decade or so, studies have helped psychologists understand exactly why male and female brains process things in such disparate--often opposing--ways. One of the most surprising discoveries undercuts the traditional notion that men are naturally better at managing money than women are.</p><p>""Women have the temperament not only to set financial goals but also to achieve them,"" says LouAnn Lofton, author of the new book Warren Buffett Invests Like a Girl--and Why You Should Too. Here's how you can harness your inborn tendencies and use them to your cash-accruing advantage:</p><p><strong>Tap Into Your Caretaking Instinct</strong><br />When someone's down for the count with a nasty cold or nursing a broken heart, the person standing at the door with warm chicken soup or a cold chardonnay is likely to be a woman. You can trace those loving tendencies to our ancestors: Men were the hunters, women the nurturers. Fast-forward millions of years and today's women feel just as responsible--for husbands, kids, friends, and aging parents. ""When it comes to saving, women don't just think about themselves,"" says Annamaria Lusardi, author of Overcoming the Saving Slump. Saving, for many women, often means working toward a goal that will benefit loved ones in significant ways.</p><p>How can you activate that trait? Use visual cues to prompt yourself to put away more. A photograph of the beach house where you and your husband can envision spending your retirement will remind you to bump up the contribution to your 401(k); a snapshot of your child in a college sweatshirt can encourage you to put more into a 529 college savings plan.</p><p><strong>Ask for Directions</strong><br />Remember how it was before GPS? You and your guy would be driving around, clearly lost. You'd want to pull into a gas station and ask for help; he'd insist he could rely on his inner compass. Chances are, you deal with finances in much the same way. Research shows that women are aware of their lack of financial knowledge--which may suggest they're more willing to ask for advice. A study in The Quarterly Journal of Economics also showed that women are less likely than men to make poor financial decisions as a result of overconfidence. ""Men tend to view asking for help as a sign of weakness,"" says Doug Hirschhorn, Ph.D., who coaches Wall Street traders.</p><p>""But women view it as a rational thing to do. As a result, they gain critical info and often make smarter decisions.""</p><p>More proof: A survey from Wells Fargo & Company found that more women than men say a financial advisor is important. What holds some women back? Paying for that advice. If that's your hurdle, hire a financial pro by the hour (find one near you at garrettplanningnetwork.com).</p><p><strong>Let Your Calmer Head Prevail</strong><br />Women take fewer financial risks than men do, but not because we're wusses. Both sexes secrete the hormone oxytocin in stressful situations, but women secrete more of it, which helps us stay calmer.</p><p>""When it comes to the stock market, a man might fear missing out on a hot tip,"" says Hirschhorn. So guys leap--possibly unwisely--faster than women might.</p><p>There are times a cautious nature can work against you. Research done at Duke University in 2009 showed that single women were more likely than single men to choose conservative asset allocations--CDs, money market funds, etc.--for retirement accounts, which means they may not have been making as much from their savings as they should have been. If you suspect you're playing it too safe, consider putting your 401(k) or IRA stash into a target-date retirement fund (see ""On the Other Hand...,"" right, for details).</p><p><strong>Act All Grown Up</strong><br />It's not exactly a big surprise that women mature earlier than men do. As a result, they tend to display better judgment, particularly when it comes to money. This difference, say experts, can help women get off on the right financial footing at an earlier age--and that's a huge advantage, because the simple fact is, the earlier you start to save and invest, the more time your money has to work for you. (Can you say ""compounded interest""?) A good way to get a head start: Sign up for a 401(k) retirement plan at work as soon as you're eligible.</p><p><strong>Keep Sharing</strong><br />Why do women tend to enjoy hobbies that are built around discussions (think book clubs and wine-tasting trips) while men can't seem to do more than grunt near each other on the basketball court?</p><p>""When women talk to each other, particularly about emotionally stimulating topics, the interaction creates feelings of intimacy, which is one reason they're more likely to do it,"" says anthropologist Helen Fisher. But many men are emotionally contained and find sharing to be anxiety provoking, so they're less likely to open up. Their loss: Sharing info can help build wealth. Look at investment clubs, which can help you beat the returns of the S&P 500, and which--ahem--tend to be composed mostly of women. To start a club of your own, go to betterinvesting.org.</p><p><strong>Focus on the Future</strong><br />Women are more likely than men to think long-term, says Fisher. What's more, a 2010 study conducted by Mark Murphy, author of Hard Goals, found that women were more likely not only to set challenging goals but also to stick to them--and that helps women financially. The mutual fund company Vanguard looked at 2.7 million IRA accounts and discovered that fewer women than men pulled their money from the stock market during the 2008-2009 recession. They may have held tight because they knew the market would bounce back eventually. Men were more apt to unload their investments, which quite possibly resulted in substantial losses.</p>",money

Too bad making up isn't. Who wants to replay all that stuff that pissed you off in the first place? Much easier to sweep the rage under the rug and leave it there - until next time. But the postclash repair process is probably the most important part of the <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/relationship-problems"">argument</a> because it forces you to work together to understand each other. That may in turn solidify your relationship, says Daniel Wile, Ph.D., author of <i>After the Fight</i>. Try this three-step plan for settling your next spat and you'll wind up holding hands - not grudges.<br /><br /><b>Step One</b><br /><br /><b>Establish a ""ready"" signal.</b> If you force a discussion while either of you is still sorting out feelings, you won't accomplish much, Dr. Wile says. You're still in fight mode and talking now is like drinking orange juice when you have a sore throat - it seems healthy, but it could sting. Let enough time pass so that you're thinking beyond the nasty exchange. The green light can be as simple as plunking a fake flower in an empty vase, as zany as e-mailing each other with the subject line ""kung pao,"" or as straightforward as a face-to-face ""Let's talk."" When each of you has sent the signal - or said the words - the forum is officially open.<br /><br /><b>Step Two</b><br /><br /><b>Make bodily contact.</b> According to a 2005 study in the journal <i>Psychosomatic Medicine</i>, physical contact raises blood levels of the hormone oxytocin, which reduces stress and makes you feel <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/online-sex"">connected</a>. So - even if it's the last thing you want to do - initiate a hug. Even sitting on the same side of the table or nestling against each other on the couch nudges you out of the fight zone and closer to make up sex.<br /><br /><b>Step Three</b><br /><br /><b>Consider his POV.</b> When you're both ready to reconcile, avoid repeating rants from the fight. It'll land you back in another bickerfest. ""The recovery conversation works only if you approach it from a different angle,"" Dr. Wile says. You don't have to pretend that you're okay with him grabbing dinner with a client and not calling you. But considering his point of view will ultimately soften his defense. Remember high school physics? For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction: If you concede just a bit, he'll do the same.<br />",relationships

Can you and your boyfriend find - at any hour, any night of the week - an episode of <i>Law & Order</i> to watch? Are you having ""8-Minute <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/the-best-sex-positions"">Missionary</a> Every Other Tuesday After David Letterman's Opening Monologue"" sex? Has your relationship slipped (and fallen) into a rut. And you know the old saying: The only difference between a rut and a grave is the depth of the hole. <br /><br />We're not stuck, you say. We're just comfortable with each other. Maybe so. ""One couple's rut may be your fun evening,"" says Pepper Schwartz, sociology professor at the University of Washington and author of <i>Between Equals: How Peer Marriage Really Works</i>. ""The question is, how does it feel?"" If you're bored, if you miss the excitement of your earlier days, if you'd rather do housework than do each other, you've probably got some digging to do.<br /><br />I don't have time, you say. I'm not creative enough. No worries, we brought the shovel. Here's how to rescue yourself from the five routines that are plaguing your <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/sex-tips-2"">sex life</a>.<br /><br /><b>Are we turning on our computers again?</b><br /><br />There are those who spend 14 hours at the office; those who work opposite shifts and are mere ships passing in the shower; those who work all day and all night (and all weekend) cleaning, mowing, babying, and making lists of what needs to get done next week. <br /><br />""The worst part of this rut is that you can actually be considered a champion for being in it, for being so dedicated,"" says couples coach Jim Sniechowski, who with his wife, Judith Sherven, cowrote <i>Be Loved For Who You Really Are</i>. ""But you're letting your work be more important than your relationship.""<br /><br />Since most of us can't quit our jobs, we need to make mini dates with our partner, Sniechowski says. Start small: Meet for lunch once a week, talk for 20 solid minutes at the end of the day, eat <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/breakfast-foods-and-weight-loss"">breakfast</a> together. Once you've got a routine, get creative. <br /><br />Jon Cofsky and Abbey Mahady, dating workaholics in Haddonfield, New Jersey, have a ""Priceline Party."" Every few weeks they wait until 4 P.M. on a weekday and shop priceline.com for a last-minute hotel deal in nearby Philadelphia. They get to be together, they get to stay in swanky hotels for low rates, and there's only one stipulation: no laptops. <br /><br /><b>Are we going to dinner and a movie again?</b><br /><br />Designate a date night, whether it's once a week, every 2 weeks, or every month, and just stick to it, says Mort Fertel, marriage coach and author of <i>Marriage Fitness</i>. Always get out of the house. Never invite anyone else. And most important? Never go to any form of entertainment where you have to face in the same direction and aren't supposed to talk. Shoot pool. Go bowling. <br /><br />""People are always looking for some dramatic, Herculean event that's going to transform the relationship,"" Fertel says. ""That's not necessary."" While it might be impressive to schedule a dual spa treatment or head up in a hot air balloon, you'll never beat the intimacy of Fertel's favorite date: going to a coffee shop.<br /><br /><b>Are we fighting about the dishes again? </b><br /><br />""There's nothing more harmful to a relationship than feeling like you're not gaining ground on something,"" Schwartz says. But we keep getting into the same sweaty ring, swearing that this time we'll throw the knockdown right hook while the crowd cheers, ""You go, girl! You finally persuaded him that he needs to listen to you more, communicate his feelings, and actually get off the couch now and then!"" <br /><br />Most people argue by launching the same ammo, but expecting different results. That is the real problem. ""You need to step back and consider, 'What does he always say before I say that? What does he do before I do that?'"" advises Michelle Weiner-Davis, author of <i>Getting Through to the Man You Love</i>. Then, you need to change what you're saying or doing. <br /><br />Chris and Ally Loprete in Los Angeles were stuck. Whenever she came home from work, he was watching sports. He would ask her how her day was, expecting a one-word answer. She'd launch into a 20-minute vent and, though he would try to listen, he'd glance at the TV, which turned into a huge, screaming, weekly fight. But when Ally stepped back, she realized she wasn't changing her ammo. So the next time he asked her about her day, she said, ""Chris, you are a sweet man. But if you ask me about my day, I'm going to tell you about it. If you want to watch the game, just say, 'Ally, I'll talk to you at the commercial or when the game's over.' Stop trying to be the nice guy, because it's really pissing me off."" Bull's-eye. <br /><br /><b>Are we watching <i>Law & Order</i> again?</b><br /><br />""When you don't take your hand off the clicker, you're paying more attention to the TV than to your spouse,"" Fertel says. ""Not good."" He threw his TV out. And you could too. But what about <i>The Bachelorette</i>, you say. And <i>Desperate Housewives</i>. Okay. But if you don't want to become a desperate housewife, agree to watch only 5 hours of TV a week. Or try a weeklong ban. How will you fill the time? Play cards. Put a puzzle together. Talk to each other. <br /><br />""The TV isn't the problem here,"" Sniechowski says. A lot of people don't know how to communicate, so they watch TV instead. Sniechowski suggests using the TV as a jumping off point. Watch <i>CSI: Miami</i>, <i>Fear Factor</i>, <i>Alias</i> - whatever - and when it's over shut off the TV and talk about the show for a few minutes, even if it's just to balk at couples who are willing to swim through raw sewage. ""You'll go on tangents,"" Sniechowski says. ""Eventually, you'll start to look forward to the conversation after the show rather than to the show itself. You might even stop watching the show all together. You won't need it anymore."" <br /><br /><b>Is it Tuesday after David Letterman's opening monologue again?</b><br /><br />""When sex is good, it's not an issue,"" says April Masini, relationship advice columnist and author of <i>Date Out of Your League</i>. ""But when it's bad, it's huge. It's one of the key sources of divorce."" First, Masini says, you need to sex up your bedroom. Get rid of the TV. Clear the nightstand of the stacks of magazines and the kids' rectal thermometers. Add aromatherapy candles (try aphrodisiac-prone jasmine or sandalwood), books of erotica (try <i>The Delta of Venus</i> by Anais Nin), and a CD player with sexy CDs (try Sarah McLachlan's ""Fumbling Towards Ecstasy"" or Prince's ""Purple Rain""). <br /><br />Now what? <br /><br />""Our bodies produce sex chemicals naturally. That's nature helping us hook up,"" says Ian Kerner, clinical sexologist and author of the best-seller <i>She Comes First</i>. ""When the sex is no longer new, we need to trick the brain into stimulating those chemicals. We need novelty."" But it's better to break the ice before breaking the iceberg. Tell each other about sexy dreams you've had. Have sex in a room in which you've never had sex before.<br /><br />Or go to the gym. Just being in each other's presence during an everyday routine can add fuel to the flame. ""Exercising together can be a great way to get the adrenaline flowing,"" says Logan Levkoff, Ph.D., a New York City sexologist. ""You get sweaty, a little competitive, and before you know it, you're in the mood for the between-the-sheets aerobics.""<br /><br />Once you're feeling, well, a little looser, Kerner suggests you give yourselves a sex-toy assignment. (You each bring home a toy of your choice.) Or role play. (Remember that fantasy you had about the guy in the produce section? Act that out.) <br /><br />When Jackie and Dave (not their real names) in Austin, Texas, were longing to re-create the rush of their first kiss, they initiated ""Story Nights."" They take turns creating personae and scenarios that lead to sex, prepping for the big night with anticipation-building e-mails hinting at how to prepare for the evening (which often involves costumes). ""Every night has brought about that raw, horny-teenager sexual tension,"" Jackie says. ""We capture that first-time feeling every time.""<br />",relationships

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/fit-for-life,Fitness,4,6,1,95,5,79,29,0,,The Secret to Being Fit for Life: Muscle Memory,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1012-fit-for-life.jpg,"<p>Five weeks and five days after giving birth, and a full nine months since running a single step, <i>WH</i>'s Lesley Rotchford, 34, laced up her sneaks and banged out five miles. Her muscles groaned a bit from the abrupt reentry, but with 20 years of distance running under their belt, they remembered just what to do.</p><p>It's a phenomenon aptly called muscle memory. Simply put, when you teach your body how to do something-ride a bike, surf, strike some <a href=""/Yoga/mood-boosting-yoga-poses"">yoga poses</a>, run a few miles-it creates a physiological blueprint. So even if you take some time off, you'll get back to where you were faster than it took you to learn the exercise in the first place. ""Muscle memory stems from your body's learning not just how to perform a task, but also how to break down muscle tissue and then repair and rebuild it,"" explains William Kraemer, Ph.D., a professor in the department of kinesiology at the University of Connecticut at Storrs. ""That physiological knowledge lets you come back from injury, surgery, and even pregnancy faster, easier, and often better than before,"" he says.</p><p>Athletes have taken advantage of muscle memory for decades. Exercise scientists have been studying it just as long. But you don't need to be an Olympian or have a Ph.D. to know how to reap the rewards. Here's how you can tap your muscle memory and enjoy the lifelong body benefits.</p><p><b>How Your Muscles Remember</b><br /><br />Not surprisingly, the process of forging muscle memory originates in the brain. When you learn something new, whether it's how to do a split squat or how to snowboard, your brain fires up all the right motor units (nerves that signal muscle fibers to kick in) to help you perform the movements.</p><p>Once your muscle fibers get the memo from your brain to move, they start sending messages back. ""When you move, you activate sensors (called proprioceptors) in your muscles, tendons, and joints that constantly give feedback to your central nervous system about where your body is in space, so it knows what muscles to fire next,"" says Adam Knight, Ph.D., an assistant professor of biomechanics at Mississippi State University. It's a continuous feedback loop from your brain to your muscles and back. ""Your brain creates pathways through your central nervous system, and movements become automatic,"" adds Wayne Westcott, Ph.D., fitness research director at Quincy College in Massachusetts. Those well-worn pathways essentially become your muscle memory.<br /></p><p>The more regularly you use these pathways, the more your muscle memory solidifies, even if you slack off for a while. Ohio University researchers put a group of women on a two-days-a-week strength-training program for 20 weeks, then let them lounge around for eight months. When they called them back to the gym along with a group of women who'd never lifted before, they found that the previously trained women had retained most of their muscle fibers. When they started pumping iron again, they made gains more rapidly than the women who had no history of strength training.</p><p>The same principle applies to any exercise, says Lee Hong, Ph.D., an assistant professor of kinesiology and neuroscience at Indiana University at Bloomington. ""If you lay off an activity for too long, you'll get rusty, but those patterns are locked in,"" says Hong. ""That's why, even after 10 or 20 years, you can get back on a bike and ride.""</p><p>Until recently, researchers believed that these ingrained neuromuscular patterns were the primary reason for the rebound-after-a-layoff effect. But Norwegian scientists recently discovered something else that may be a game changer in the way we understand how the body gets-and stays-fit. Turns out, exercise also triggers longterm, possibly permanent, changes in your cells. In a study of mice, researchers found that after just six days of simulated strength training, the mice generated new nuclei in their muscle cells. This is a big deal, since these nuclei contain the DNA blueprint necessary to make new muscle. And months after the mice stopped training, even though their muscles had shrunk, those newly formed nuclei were still hanging around, waiting to be reactivated by exercise, says study leader Kristian Gundersen, Ph.D., of the University of Oslo. ""It's not unrealistic to suspect that human muscles respond as quickly and that those nuclei last for decades, or even a lifetime,"" he says.</p><p>The more exercise you do, the more memory you can bank and the easier it is to make deposits. ""It's like a health savings account,"" says Hong. And as with any savings account, it's best to start early-like now. Gundersen's research found that the ability to make new muscle decreases as you age. ""The earlier you start and the more you build, the better off you'll be later in life,"" says Hong.</p><p><b>Your Body Never Forgets</b><br /><br />There's no getting around this: If you take a few months (or years!) off from exercise, you will huff and puff and feel achy as your body gets back into the swing of things. But if you establish a history of fitness, your pain will be a lot more manageable. Any sweat equity you invest forges a cardiovascular and strength blueprint that helps you make gains faster and be less prone to soreness and injury than someone who has never lifted anything heavier than a glass of merlot or has run only when chased.</p><p>And there's more good news: Muscle memory's impact extends beyond general fitness. The physical changes your body undergoes while building a fitness platform help speed up your metabolism, make you more resilient to stress, and bolster your immune system, says Kraemer. ""All these adaptations become ingrained physiologically,"" he adds. Muscle memory not only helps you get more from every workout but also ""spills into your everyday life, making you a better-functioning human being.""</p><p>To see the exercises that will help you stay fit for life, check out the <a href=""/fitness/muscle-workout"">muscle memory workout</a>.</p><p></p>",What To Wear

She had that look I'd seen many times before - a glower of fury. Alarm. Utter revulsion. I knew immediately she had walked by the construction workers again.<br /><br />Every morning at 9 a.m. they were waiting - at least 10 of them, usually more - perched like turkey buzzards in tool belts on the 4-foot high concrete walls outside the west entrance of our office building. I'd heard the stories from those who'd braved the gauntlet. From Ashley. From April. From Erica. And, of course, from Carrie - Carrie who is 25; Carrie who is tall and thin and naturally blonde; Carrie who, though she won't admit it, struts.<br /><br />""It is so rude,"" Carrie spat, a shudder quaking up her spine so spastically you'd think that today they'd all jumped down and licked her. ""I can feel their eyes boring into me.""<br /><br />""Really?"" I said. ""I'd kill for that.""<br /><br />Carrie laughed. She thought I was joking. But, the truth was, I couldn't remember the last time a construction worker had glanced in my general direction, much less bored his eyes into me. I was due for a little boring.<br /><br />The next morning as I walked from the train, I spied a different group of workers in front of the old cheese shop, sitting outside on overturned 5-gallon buckets. This was my chance. I moved in closer, looking straight ahead, pretending I didn't see them - all while straining my peripheral vision so much that my right eyeball felt like it was going to seize in a cramp. I walked by the old guys with the buzz cuts. Nothing. I walked by the cute dark-haired kid with the tattoos. Nada. I walked by the buff one with the silver bolt in his tongue. Zip. My body kept on walking, but my saucy inner vixen fell to her knees, her face straining up to the heavens, her fists trembling in the air. ""For the love of Jesus, what has happened to me?""<br /><br />It was a fact: I had become invisible to construction workers. Did they know I turned 30? Got married? Stopped waxing my bikini line? Could they tell I'd had a baby? That <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/pregnancy-perks"">pregnancy</a> gave me skin tags? And 15 pounds I couldn't shake? And hair in places where hair should not be? How did they not see the one good thing that came out of it - okay, the one good thing besides the baby - these massive, fabulous, first-time-in-my-life-bigger-than-an-A-cup nursing boobs?<br /><br />I wasn't a Carrie when I was 25. But I got my share of up-and-down glances, a little whistle here, a little ""Mornin', Doll"" there - moments that I outwardly scoffed at with a sniff of Women's Studies 101 annoyance and inwardly, secretly, celebrated with a little happy dance and the first verse of ""I Feel Pretty."" Then, suddenly, just like my waist, it all disappeared. I'd officially crossed the line into No Man's (Not Even Construction Workers') Land. I'd evolved from ""Miss"" to ""Ma'am,"" from hottie to mommy.<br /><br />""You are pathetic,"" my husband, Thad, reassured me, after I regaled him with my morning walk of shame and threatened to start wearing Naturalizers. He was right. I was too educated for this. Too successful, competent, and relentlessly cocky to actually measure my desirability in wolf whistles. I knew this.<br /><br />""Plus,"" he added, ""you are a MILF.""<br /><br />""I am not!""<br /><br />""Well, you're a mother I'd like to f?""<br /><br />""You,"" I interrupted, ""don't count.""<br /><br />""If you feel MILF-y, you'll be MILF-y!""<br /><br />""You suck.""<br /><br />But he was right again. No I wasn't feeling particularly MILF-y. Not a single pair of my prepregnancy jeans fit. I had a postpartum colony of zits on my right upper arm and my nipples were as big as stop signs. I was feeling frumpy, hairy, and stretch-marked. In fact I wasn't feeling anything else - not competent, not cocky. And no amount of daily morning affirmations in the mirror (""You are pretty! You are PRETTY! You are F-ING PRETTY!"") was making my newfound nursing boobs any perkier. To prove that I still had it, I needed reassurance. I needed a man on an overturned 5-gallon bucket to pronounce, ""God damn, that is one fine ass.""<br /><br />I took matters into my own hands. First there was the issue of timing. I started taking the 8:32 a.m. train. My regular one, the 8:22, got me to the cheese shop too early - before my boys were even on their break. Then I experimented with the walk - a hustle one day, a sashay the next. Hair up. Hair down. One-inch heels. Three-inch heels. Suit. Skirt. Obscenely low-cut turquoise V-neck. I don't know what discouraged me more - that I'd become so desperate that I was prostituting my cleavage or that my prostituted cleavage wasn't even enough to make these men give me a second look.<br /><br />When I got to work, I went directly to the kitchen to drown my piteousness in a hazelnut decaf. There, eating her vanilla yogurt bar, was Carrie.<br /><br />""They sang to me today,"" she said.<br /><br />""What?""<br /><br />""They sang,"" she said. ""'You Are Always on My Mind.'""<br /><br />My first thought was to poke out her twinkling, uncrow's-footed, periwinkle blue eyes. But I didn't. Because I'd started to feel sorry for Carrie, sorrier than I even felt for myself. Not getting checked out and wanting to? That was sad. But getting checked out and not letting yourself enjoy it at all? That was plain irresponsible. Because someday, without any warning, it will end. And when that day comes - and, strut or no strut, that day will come - Carrie will miss it. She'll wonder why she thought it was all so terrible?these guys who were not yelling ""You're ugly!"" or ""You're chunky!"" but who were telling her, however creepily, that she looked good. She'll wonder why she wasted so much time cursing them instead of giving them a wink and, every now and again, a little runway spin. I needed to persuade her to gather ye wolf whistles why ye may and all that. But first I needed to gather the few remaining dregs of my own.<br /><br />The next morning I stormed up the street to the cheese shop, stopped in front of the guy with the bolt in his tongue, cocked my hip to the side and asked: ""What does a girl have to do?""<br /><br />He froze, mid-chew, as if not moving might divert this elderly woman with the skin tags who appeared to be seconds away from attack.<br /><br />""What does a girl have to do to get checked out by you guys?""<br /><br />""Um?"" he stuttered, looking to his compadres for rescue. ""Walk by?""<br /><br />""Walk by? Walk BY?!"" I was mad now - so mad I wasn't concentrating on what I was wearing or how I was walking. I wasn't thinking about the 15 pounds or the stop signs under my bra. I wasn't feeling old. Instead for the first time in a long time, I was feeling kind of powerful, saucy even. ""Well, I WALK BY you every single day and you never check me out!"" And then I unleashed - about the sashaying and the turquoise V-neck and MILFs and Carrie and my waist going missing and?<br /><br />Someone walked behind me. He said something to the boys I didn't hear that made them all nod like bobbleheads.<br /><br />""What did you say?"" I asked, turning around. He was older, a foreman maybe. And he answered me instantly, his tone as frank and reverent as a nun's ""God bless.""<br /><br />""Nice rack.""<br /><br />I was startled. ""Yeah?"" I said. Thirty-four years and not once, ever, had anyone said those words to me. I looked down at my fabulous nursing boobs, and the successful, talented, rock 'n' roll vixen behind them. Then I looked at the line of boys.<br /><br />""I'm just going to walk by now,"" I said.<br /><br />And I walked by.<br />",Woman to Woman

But going to school in 10-degree weather was great motivation to lead a successful life, because now...I get to do pretty much whatever the hell I want, and I'm much happier.</p><p><b>Did you do a stint waiting tables like everyone else trying to break into show business? </b>Yes, I waited tables for about five years, when I was in my twenties, and the experience made me very, very angry-angry at not being successful, angry at the human race, and most of all, angry that people could take upwards of 20 minutes to decide which kind of pasta they wanted for lunch. I think it should be a law that every person has to wait tables for six months after graduating from college. And if you choose not to go to college, then you have to wait tables for two years. Everyone needs to see what it's like on the other side, so they know how to treat waiters and waitresses.</p><p><b>What was your big break</b>? I was 23 and playing the Improv in L.A., and my then-­future manager approached me after a show. I was like, ""Oh my God! I'm represented by the same people that rep Chris Rock and Keanu Reeves!"" But then you realize that none of that is going to have anything to do with what they do for you, so...you keep [the excitement] to a dull roar.</p><p><b>They must have done something right. You got your own show. Did you watch a lot of talk shows growing up? </b>I never really watched late-night talk shows. I mean, I loved Oprah-I couldn't get enough of that. But I never set out to become a talk-show host. I just knew that I had to talk loudly, and I wanted people to listen.</p><p><b>And read. The title of your second book is a nod to <i>Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret</i>. I'm guessing you read it as a girl.</b> Yeah-I loved Judy Blume.</p><p><b>In that book, Margaret is surprised when she gets her period for the first time. What's the most shocking thing in your book? </b>Walking in on the guy I was dating while he was playing a little game of peek-a-boo with his penis. I'd say that was pretty shocking. </p><p><b>Okaaay-change of subject. Because you've been so busy, how do you fit in exercise? </b>Right now, I'm pretty motivated. I exercise four or five times a week. I do sprints and work out with my trainer and do Pilates. I like to mix it up so I don't burn out. I've also been seeing a nutritionist, so I'm eating healthy and have tons of energy. </p><p><b>Sounds pretty disciplined. Do you ever slack?</b> Well, I'm way into salt. If I could eat whatever I wanted, it would be cheeseburgers, French fries, pizza, Doritos, and Mexican food. I have to be careful because it's a slippery slope, and the minute you start indulging, you want more. But it works in the opposite way, too. When you eat healthy, suddenly chips don't sound so great. </p><p><b>Last question: What do you like to do on your days off?</b> My boyfriend's a go-getter, so we don't spend a lot of time lounging in bed. But if it's rainy, I will be under the covers all day watching Lifetime or <i>Newlyweds</i>. I could be orgasmically happy doing that.</p><p><b>Chelsea's rules...</b></p><p><b>Own one good pair of shoes. </b><br />""They can make an outfit, no matter where it's from.

Researchers are discovering that insomnia is a risk factor for other serious maladies, including <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/what-you-should-know-about-your-heart"" target=""_blank"">heart disease </a>and depression. It often appears as a side effect of a different problem - <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/sports-injuries"" target=""_blank"">pain</a> from a medical complaint or a stressful life-changing event, such as a breakup or the loss of a job. But it can linger after the primary difficulty has been resolved. As a result, <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/the-top-doctors-in-america"" target=""_blank"">doctors</a> say that if you find yourself suffering from acute insomnia - a week or two of very poor sleep quality - you need help. ""For a lot of people, <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/conditions/insomnia"">insomnia</a> takes on a life of its own,"" says Wilfred Pigeon, Ph.D., a sleep specialist at the University of Rochester. ""The longer someone has <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/conditions/insomnia"">insomnia</a>, the more intractable it becomes."" Why? Because when you spend night after night lying awake, you start to anticipate not falling asleep, and you develop habits and associations that prolong the problem.

The data suggests, however, that these medications may be habit-forming, and at least some patients report that they stop working over time. Specialists say that pills are best used as a short-term solution for sudden, intense bouts of insomnia. If the problem persists, the best approach is to change your sleep habits. <br /><br /></li><li>Learning proper <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/sleep-better-2"" target=""_blank"">sleep techniques</a> is a bit like going to boot camp - for weeks at a time, patients are denied bed except for short periods.

For best results this process should be supervised by an expert at a sleep clinic, but you can try to provoke a sleep craving by going to bed later than you normally would, while always rising at the same time in the morning no matter how tired you are - and never napping. Gradually allow yourself to go to bed earlier, keeping your wake time the same.<br /><br /></li><li>Never try to sleep, and don't spend extra time in bed.

Blame it on too much work, too little sleep, too few hours in the day. But before you know it, days without getting busy can turn into weeks, and weeks turn into months or even years. Yep-years.</p><p>If this hits a little too close to home, you're not alone. Low-sex and sexless relationships are becoming a national epidemic.</p><p><b>Dry Spells, Decoded</b><br />According to data collected in 2010 by The Kinsey Institute as part of the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, nearly 16 percent of married couples had not hit the sheets in the past six months to a year. (Experts estimate that millions of Americans are in low-or no-sex marriages, meaning they're getting busy 10 times a year or fewer.)</p><p>Do you and your honey have to be hot and heavy in order to be happy? The short answer: Yes. The fact is, sex starvation can endanger a couple's union. Research shows that people in low-and no-sex marriages report that they're less happy and more likely to consider divorce. ""Sex is really about feeling connected,"" says marriage therapist Michele Weiner-Davis, author of <i>The Sex-Starved Marriage: Boosting Your Marriage Libido</i>. Without that physical connection, many couples begin to feel estranged from each other, inciting a vicious circle of unintentional celibacy: You don't talk about the lack of nookie because it can be easier to ignore the elephant in the (bed)room. This leaves you feeling disconnected, frustrated, and even angry, and thus less likely to be raring to jump your guy's bones.</p><p>""When the sex drops out of a relationship, emotional closeness on all levels seems to disappear as well. You stop cuddling in bed and even laughing at each other's jokes,"" says Weiner-Davis.</p><p>And once you stop having sex, it's hard to know how to start up again, especially because embarrassment, awkwardness, and resentment are often associated with such abstinence. But ignoring the touchy topic won't make the problem go away. What will? Taking sex off the back burner-in a big way-with these <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships"">sex tips</a>.</p><p><b>The Heavy-Sex Rx</b><br />To bust out of your bedroom rut, say experts, raise the stakes. Make a no-excuses pact to get busy every day for a month straight. ""This might seem daunting, but in the long run it will pay off for your relationship,"" says psychotherapist Tina B. Tessina, Ph.D., author of Money, Sex, and Kids: Stop Fighting About the Three Things That Can Ruin Your Marriage. The key is to be receptive to sex even when you don't necessarily ""feel"" like it so that you don't lose momentum.</p><p>This may sound counterintuitive-conventional wisdom says that desire comes before arousal, right? Not always the case. ""Research shows that many women have to be physically stimulated before their brain tells them that they desire sex,"" says Weiner-Davis. ""Those who adopt the philosophy of 'just do it' often find that they actually enjoy themselves and start feeling closer and more connected to their partner.""</p><p>Chalk it up to hormones. Once arousal kicks in, the love hormones dopamine and oxytocin, which are released during sex and orgasm, create bliss and help you bond with your man, says Diana Hoppe, M.D., author of Healthy Sex Drive, Healthy You: What Your Libido Reveals About Your Life. So going horizontal more often can actually lift a sagging libido as well as improve the love connection between you and your guy, both inside and outside the bedroom.</p><p>And knocking boots nightly not only removes the ""are we or aren't we?"" pressure but also can inspire you to switch up the sexual script. You might decide to try new positions or get busy at different times of the day or in new places around the house as a way of keeping things fresh.</p><p>But more than that, the increased intimacy amplifies the bond you have as a couple. And after the 30-day sexperiment is over, you'll likely find that you and your guy slip between the sheets more often than before. ""Sex begets sex,"" says Tessina.</p><p>""It makes us feel better, more alive, sexier, and more loved."" And who wouldn't want an extra dose of that?</p>",You and Improved
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/truth-about-common-drugs,Health,4,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,,Medical Myth Busters: Popping Pills,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0603-drug-deals-0581.jpg,"We all know that <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/medical-myths-revealed"">antiperspirants</a> don't cause cancer and Mountain Dew won't lower sperm count. But despite our discerning minds, there are plenty of protect-yourself health myths like these that get passed along as fact - especially where medications are concerned. This can be a problem, considering 73 percent of over-the-counter medications are purchased by women and 66 percent of women age 18 to 34 use prescription drugs. So we asked experts to help clear up seven of the most common misconceptions about meds. <br /><br /><b>MYTH! Staying on the <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/the-right-birth-control"">birth control pill </a>too long decreases your chances of getting pregnant later.</b> <br />When you're ready for that Bugaboo stroller, the Wiccan fertility spell isn't your only option. As soon as the Pill is purged from your body (by the end of the first period after you stop taking it), you'll be able to conceive just as easily as someone who never took an oral contraceptive, says Anita Sadaty, M.D., attending physician in obstetrics and gynecology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York. <br /><br /><b>MYTH! If two Tylenol aren't helping your hammering <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/headache-causes-and-how-to-treat-them"">headache</a>, a couple more might.</b><br />More may be better when it comes to kissing and cashmere but not pain relievers, especially acetaminophen (the main ingredient in Tylenol, aspirin-free Anacin, and Excedrin). ""Taking more than the recommended amount isn't going to make it work any better because acetaminophen has a ceiling dose,"" says Patrick J. McDonnell, Pharm.D., associate professor of clinical pharmacy at Temple University School of Pharmacy in Philadelphia. So what to do when it feels like The Judas Priest Reunion Tour is underway in your head? For acute migraines, ask your doctor about taking a triptan or antimigraine medicine with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). A new study found that the duo can help this kind of severe headache better than either drug alone. <br /><br /><b>MYTH! Stick with the brand of drug your doctor prescribes. </b><br />And if your mom insisted on handpicking your dates, you'd listen to her too, right? The reason a doctor prescribes one brand over another may have more to do with the pens he's gotten from the pharmaceutical reps than the quality of the product. The truth is, many drugs do essentially the same thing, but the cost can be the difference between a Mercedes and a Hyundai, Dr. Sadaty says. Insurance plans work with a list of drugs that they'll reimburse you for, typically broken down into a tier system (such as generic, brand name preferred, and brand name nonpreferred) that dictates your co-payment. But because doctors work with so many patients on varying insurance plans, they don't know which pill your plan lets you buy cheaply. So on your next visit, bring a copy of your insurance plan's list (call customer service or look it up online; it'scalled the formulary). <br /><br /><b>MYTH! Abide by the almighty expiration date.</b><br />Your sinuses are shot and the only cold medicine you can find expired when a Democrat was still in office. Do you dare ingest this chemical corpse? OTC drug manufacturers are required to prove that their product will maintain 100 percent of its original potency until the expiration date, but that doesn't mean it falls flat the day after it expires. The military proved this when it contracted with the FDA to test thousands of dollars of expired drugs in its warehouse and found that 86 percent of them were still ticking well beyond their expiration date - in some cases, up to 15 years after. As a general rule, prescription meds shouldn't be taken after their expiration date (the antibiotic tetracycline was actually found to be harmful at that point). But taking the occasional cold tablet or aspirin that's past its prime probably won't hurt you, says Howard LeWine, M.D., a clinical instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. Ensure your meds last until their expiration date by storing them in a cool, dry place like the fridge, not the medicine cabinet.<br /><br /><b>MYTH! Name-brand drugs are better than generic.</b><br />We're not talking diamonds versus cubic zirconias. The name brand might have nicer packaging, but that's it. ""The generic version of any drug is just as effective as the name brand, contains the same active ingredient, and meets the same purity and quality standards,"" says Tom McGinnis, Pharm.D, the FDA's director for pharmacy affairs. So store-brand ibuprofen is just as good as Advil. The discrepancy in cost boils down to this: When a new drug is developed, it can cost hundreds of millions of dollars in research, development, marketing, and promotion. To compensate, the drug manufacturer jacks up the price of the drug. But after 20 years, a drug patent expires and generic versions of the same drug appear on the market - selling for up to 80 percent less than the name brand because they need not recoup those development costs.<br /><br /><b>MYTH! Taking an antibiotic will knock out your cold faster.</b> <br />It's like pouring Yoo-hoo on an open wound: Why would you do that? Antibiotics have no effect on the viruses that cause colds. (You can ease cold symptoms with various OTC remedies and vitamin C, but the only thing that will clear up the cold is time.) Take an antibiotic you don't need and the next time you actually require one, it might not work, says Neil Schachter, M.D., a professor of pulmonary medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City and author of <i>The Good Doctor's Guide to Colds and Flu</i>. That's because antibiotics kill off some bacteria, but the surviving bacteria multiply and are now more resistant to antibiotics. <br /><br /><b>MYTH! Trash the Celebrex.</b><br />Although the irritating commercials proclaiming ""Celebrate! Celebrate!"" may have scared you off this anti-inflammatory drug, far scarier was the news that fellow COX-2 inhibitors like Vioxx and Bextra were shown in some studies to increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. But, while the FDA advisory committee found that Celebrex is indeed associated with an increased risk of heart attack, they concluded that the benefits outweighed the potential risks. And most likely you're not at high risk anyway (unless you've had heart problems or surgery). Just talk to your doctor before you continue taking it, McDonnell says. ",You and Improved

Could it be cancer? Where are the damn tweezers? But while you may be tempted to fear the worst or to turn your bathroom into an OR, remember that most of these lumpy intruders are about as nonthreatening as a sedated Lhasa apso. Here's a fast guide to figuring out which are harmless - and which need serious attention.<br /><br /><b>""It feels like a pea in my neck.""</b><br /><br />That's the same bump your doctor feels for during a checkup - a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/learn-about-breast-cancer-treatment"">lymph node</a>. These hard, movable, pea-size nodules are in hundreds of locales all over the body but are most palpable in the neck, groin, armpits, and behind the collarbone. Their mission: to filter out toxins and dead blood cells. When you have a cold or even a minor bacterial infection, your lymph nodes may swell because they're being bombarded with dead cells, says Julie Vose, M.D., professor of medicine and chief of hematology and oncology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. For instance if you have an infection in your finger, you may have an enlarged lymph node in your armpit. (Different nodes respond to different regions of the body.) The node should return to normal size in a few weeks. <br /><br /><b>Check, Please</b> If the swollen gland persists or grows bigger than a pea and stays that way for more than 2 weeks - or if you have multiple swollen glands - see a doctor. He or she will probably prescribe an antibiotic. Has the node grown to the size of a cherry tomato? It may require a biopsy to check for <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/men-and-breast-cancer"">cancer</a>. <br /><br /><b>""It looks like my big toe is making room for a sixth toe.""</b><br /><br />Your big toe is making way for a bunion, an enlargement of bone or tissue around the bottom joint that's causing your toe to angle in toward the little ones. ""It's arthritis in its purest form,"" says Suzanne Levine, D.P.M., a podiatric surgeon in New York City. The cause is either heredity or what you put on your feet. The main footwear culprits: heels that are too narrow or don't have enough room in the toe box (there should be at least 1 inch of space from the end of your big toe to the tip of the shoe) and archless footwear like ballet flats and flip-flops. Try elevating and icing the bunion for 20 minutes or applying an analgesic ointment like BenGay.<br /><br /><b>Check, Please</b> If home remedies don't reduce swelling and pain, a podiatrist can inject an anti-inflammatory drug like dexamethasone phosphate. Bunion surgery is also an option, though recovery can take up to a year (you'll be walking with a surgical shoe for 4 weeks, then allowed to wear only sneakers until it's completely healed; 2 months minimum) and there's no guarantee it will fully relieve your pain. <br /><br /><b>""It feels like a marble.""</b><br /><br />The culprit is probably a cyst or alipoma. Both are noncancerous, usually moveable, and liable to pop up almost anywhere. Cysts are extremely common, forming when dead skin cells, which usually shed monthly, get trapped under a clogged pore. Although a lipoma looks like a cyst, it's actually a benign skin tumor composed of fat cells. The good news is that both are the reality show contestants of your body: They're annoying but usually go away on their own. You can help prevent cyst formation (there are no preventative measures for lipo-mas) by using an exfoliating cream with lactic acid every day after showering. Many dermatologists recommend Lac-Hydrin, available at drugstores. <br /><br /><b>Check, Please</b> Have it checked if it lingers for more than 2 months or gets noticeably bigger to rule out skin cancer, says Ariel Ostad, M.D., a dermatologist in New York City. Any tenderness, redness, or pus could signal an infection - treatable with antibiotics or removal (in-office extraction under local anesthesia with a few stitches). <br /><br /><b>""It feels like a tiny water balloon is growing from my vagina!""</b><br /><br />Blame it on a clogged Bartholin duct. These two tiny tubes on either side of your hoo-hah (think 4 and 8 o'clock) secrete lube in conjunction with the Bartholin's glands (two pea-size organs under the skin) when your engine gets revved up. Sometimes secreted lubrication gets trapped in the duct, causing a soft, squishy Bartholin's duct cyst that swells near the vaginal opening. Lovely, we know. But take heart: They're typically benign and usually don't require treatment. ""If it looks like a pea and goes away on its own, then it was probably temporarily clogged, and I wouldn't worry about it,"" says Colleen Kennedy, M.D., assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Iowa. You may be able to unplug the duct by sitting in a warm bath for 20 minutes two to three times a day.<br /><br /><b>Check, Please</b> If the cyst becomes painful or increases in size, see a doctor, who will most likely recommend a procedure called marsupialization. This in-office procedure involves draining the cyst, then sewing the cyst wall to the outer skin to create a new duct. It'll heal in about a month.<br /><br /><b>""Oh my God, there's a lump in my boob!""</b><br /><br />Bumpy boobs aren't uncommon. Your lump is likely one of three things, all without clear-cut causes (and all of which are noncancerous): 1) Fibrocystic breast change, a combination of fibrous tissue and many very small cysts, affecting about 50 percent of all women. 2) Fibroadenoma, a movable mass of hard, rubbery tissue that can be any size. It tends to occur in women in their twenties and thirties, possibly because of hormones. 3) A cyst, which usually feels like a soft grape but can be as hard as a marble, depending on how much fluid it contains. Cysts primarily affect women over age 40.<br /><br /><b>Check, Please</b> Red flag a lump lasting for more than two menstrual cycles (hormones can spur come-and-go bumps). ""Any new discrete lump should be biopsied, especially in women past their early twenties,"" says Harry Bear, M.D., Ph.D., chairman of the division of surgical oncology at the Massey Cancer Center and Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. <br /><br /><b>""It looks like a big pimple on my chest."" </b><br /><br />While you might fixate on it like a pimple, don't mutilate it as you might a pimple. It could be the most common type of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma. Carcinomas grow very slowly, so it could take years before it develops that characteristic look: round, raised, and pearly with visible blood vessels and a rolled border around the bump. Caught early, treatment is nearly 95 percent effective and ranges from a scalpel to laser removal (which leaves virtually no scarring). To prevent it you know the drill: SPF 30 all over, applied every 2 hours.<br /><br /><b>Check, Please</b> ""The warning sign for any skin cancer is that you have a sore or lesion that just doesn't heal,"" says Asra Ali, M.D., assistant professor of dermatology at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston. ""It may bleed or be itchy, and it's usually located in a sun-exposed area."" Think the face, chest, upper back, arms, back of the hands, and stomach. If the persistent pimple-like bump doesn't disappear in a month, see a doctor.<br />","You and Improved,Be In The Know"
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/office-germ-tips,Health,2,6,3,3,0,0,1,0,,Health Tip: Learn How to Germ-Proof Your Office,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0507-occupational-safety-0136.jpg,"You swear by the office bathroom drill: Wash hands, dry hands, use paper towel to open door, maneuver elbow and leg to move door, and return - skin untouched by germ threats - to your desk. Where, on average, about 21,000 germs per square inch await you - or 400 times more than the toilet seat you were so worried about. Your <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/decorate-your-office"">workspace</a> needs some sanitation love, too. Our disinfecting tips will get you started, with less effort than it takes you to exit the bathroom.<br /><br /><b>Know Thy Enemy</b> Germs thrive on human touch, so anything that gets regular contact - telephone, mouse, keyboard - is a threat. ""You're touching about 30 objects per minute in your workspace,"" says germ guru Charles Gerba, Ph.D., a microbiologist from the University of Arizona, who recently conducted a study of germs in the workplace. Among his findings: The humble cubicle is the germiest place in the office.<br /><br /><b>Grab a Wipe</b> Wipe down your space daily with a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/health-fact-and-fiction"">disinfectant</a> - a chemical agent that kills microorganisms (plain ol' water won't deep-six germs). Handy dispenser wipes like Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and Lysol Sanitizing Wipes run only about 10 cents a sheet.<br /><br /><b>Play Defense</b> Don't just wash your hands in that bathroom ritual; scrub 'em, says Jack Brown, Ph.D., author of <i>Don't Touch That Doorknob! How Germs Can Zap You and How You Can Zap Back</i>. ""The scrubbing motion dislodges the organisms from the surface,"" he says, adding that a thorough wash should take about 45 seconds.<br /><br /><b>Use Alcohol</b> If you're desk-confined, disinfect your hands with a sanitizer that contains alcohol, such as Purell Instant Hand Sanitizer. ""Alcohol is a drying agent,"" Dr. Brown says. ""It tends to pull water away from the organisms, and that harms them.""<br /><br /><b>Avoid the Crowd</b> Shared space like the office kitchen is a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/germs-at-the-gym"">germ magnet</a>. ""About 20 percent of the office cups contain coliform bacteria, which is related to fecal contamination,"" Dr. Gerba says. Opt for a paper cup, or keep your own mug and wash it regularly with dish soap and a paper towel. And when possible, pass on control of the PowerPoint remote in the conference room - the gadgets registered some of the highest bacteria levels in Dr. Gerba's study.<br />","You and Improved,Be In The Know"

There, she stopped exercising and started hitting the dining hall-hard. ""I'd eat what I now know is three portions of pasta at one time,"" says the 32-year-old university administrator from Washington, D.C., whose weight peaked at 180 pounds. After graduation, she shrunk from a size 14 to a 10 by counting calories, but within six months her new clothes were too tight again. Her weight hovered in the 170s for the next eight years.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Change</b><br /><br />On her doctor's advice, Jennifer joined a gym in January 2009 and hired a trainer. For her first session, she recalls, ""I couldn't even find a T-shirt that fit!"" When the trainer took her measure­ments and told her that her body-fat percentage was 35, Jennifer felt embarrassed-and then determined. ""I wanted to prove I could do this,"" she says.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Lifestyle</b><br /><br />Jennifer fit in a.m. treadmill and elliptical workouts five days a week, and did free weights under her trainer's supervision. She kept a food journal and began eating six mini meals a day instead of two huge ones. It paid off: She lost 33 pounds by June. But then she hit a wall. ""I just could not move the scale!"" she says. To kick up her calorie burn, she added cardio intervals to her workouts, and healthy foods like spinach and tuna to her diet. By November 2009, she was at 135 pounds. ""I felt empowered,"" she says. ""I truly never thought I could <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.lookbetternakedbook.com/set/?keycode=142686"">lose the weight</a>.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Reward</b><br /><br />The girl who couldn't do a single pushup can now crank out 30 of them in a minute. ""I have much more energy these days,"" says Jennifer. ""I feel like a completely different person.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Jennifer's Tips</b><br /><br /><i>Stay local.</i> ""My membership at a fancy gym was gathering dust, so I joined a gym closer to home. Now I have no excuse not to go.""<br /><br /><i>Be creative.</i> ""Cheerios with raisins and nuts satisfies my nighttime craving for sweets.""<br /><br /><i>Gain a following.</i> ""I started a Twitter feed to stay motivated.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/life-tips,Life,2,5,1,8,0,0,0,0,,Escape Any Sticky Situation,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1007-situation-art.jpg,"<p>So you've found yourself in an awkward predicament, and you don't have a clue what to do? Well, relax: We've got it covered. On these pages, you'll find a collection of quick and clever fixes for some of life's trickiest quandaries- metaphorical fire extinguishers, if you will. Just think of them as a stack of get-out-of-jail-free cards for a deserving girl with the best of intentions and a moment of bad luck.</p><p><strong>Your significant other's mom (or another member of his clan) overhears you talking about her.</strong><br />This is one of those times when you have to be a straight shooter. No pussyfooting or hand-wringing, or insincere, mealymouthed, girlie retractions. Woman up. Swallow hard, look whomever happened to be in earshot straight in the eye, and in the most level voice you can manage, say something akin to ""I'm so sorry. It wasn't my intention that you hear that.""</p><p>What comes next depends on how the person responds. If what you said wasn't too harsh or inflammatory, and if the other person isn't insulted or infuriated, perhaps you can restate it in a kinder, gentler manner: ""Forgive me. I should have taken this up directly with you earlier. What I meant to convey is...."" Even though you might be embarrassed, don't forget you're the perpetrator here. It is up to you to take responsibility and defuse the situation, and the best way to do that is to come off as contrite and apologetic rather than defensive or argumentative.</p><p><strong>You know the movie <em>27 Dresses</em>? Well, that chick has nothing on you. And you don't want to be a bridesmaid this time.</strong><br />It happens to the best of us: You get a call from your summer-camp bunkmate out of the blue, and the next thing you know you're standing next to her in a royal blue dress. Oy. Unless this person is a very close friend or relative, do not feel compelled to do something you really don't want to do. Being a bridesmaid takes effort, money, and commitment, and if you question your ability to give any of those things, do everyone a favor and politely decline. Simply tell the bride that you're honored but you don't feel you can commit to being a bridesmaid. As soon as you give her a reason, she'll start looking for a way around it, so just let her know you are happy for her and obviously are excited to attend the wedding as a guest, but you think it's best that she ask someone else to stand with her. As a compromise, you can offer to do a reading or take on some other task at the wedding to show the bride you're supportive. And be sure to get her a fabulous gift-no matter what you choose, it will cost less than throwing her a shower!</p><p><strong>You want to leave a party early without seeming rude.</strong><br />If you know in advance that you're going to have to leave early, say so when you accept the invite. Otherwise, explain the situation to the host when you first arrive. Jumping up from a seated dinner party and exclaiming ""Sorry, it's a school night"" isn't the way to handle it. When you do leave, make it swift and silent. Say good-bye to the people you're talking with, then find your host. As you thank him or her, mention some aspect of the party you enjoyed. The next day, phone the host. It's always polite to do this, but when you've left early, the second thank-you will cover your butt.</p><p>If the urge to make a speedy exit comes over you mid-party, how and when you do it depends on the size of the gathering. If it's a large group, you still should tell your host you're leaving, giving a good reason like a work appointment at dawn, and then slip quietly away. If it's a sit-down dinner, sorry-you're stuck through dessert and the conversation apres... for at least half an hour. Premature departure isn't just rude, it's insulting to the other guests. If you're desperate, arrange to get a fake emergency call on your iPhone. Just download the fake-call app and program it for when you need it to ring. Genius, right?</p><p><strong>You forget to invite someone important to your upcoming party, and he or she finds out.</strong><br />Call right away and invite the person. Be honest: You intended to ask her but forgot. Offer an excuse, lame or not, about the craziness of your life and the other people and things you've been forgetting lately. Apologize so profusely that she will be convinced you are sincere (which, hopefully, you are). Within a few days, send a note, card, or e-mail offering another brief but graceful mea culpa for your oversight. If she's coming to the event, say you're looking forward to seeing her, and reiterate the particulars of time, place, and so on. If she can't attend, say you're looking forward to making a date to get together soon, then follow up on that.</p><p><strong>You arrive at an event and realize you're way underdressed.</strong><br />Slip off to the bathroom and give your outfit a quick assessment-pull off your hoodie, tuck in your T-shirt, and neaten anything that can be neatened. Take your hair down from a ponytail or pull it up into a French twist. Add extra makeup-lipstick and mascara do wonders. Most important, stand tall and walk with confidence. You may not be the best-dressed girl in the room, but you are the most comfortable. Don't sabotage a potentially fun evening by spending it apologizing for your outfit.</p><p><strong>Your friend asks what you really think about what she's trying on.</strong><br />Use your judgment. Does your friend truly want to know what you think, or does she want you to confirm her opinion? We have a tendency to lie to ourselves when trying on clothes, so do her a favor and be honest enough to save her from looking ridiculous. But by no means should you tell her she looks terrible. Instead, suggest choosing something else that would showcase her hourglass figure or bring out the green in her eyes. The problem is with the garment, never with her. And if your friend is supersensitive, you can always make it about the budget: ""Do you really think that halter top is worth $200?"" Chances are, she'll get the picture.</p><p><strong>Someone you aren't crazy about asks you for a recommendation.</strong><br />You can dislike someone and still respect him and the way he does his job. The first thing is to ask yourself if you and this person just don't click personally, or if your antipathy extends to his professional skills as well. If job skills are the problem, just say you are too busy or don't know him or his work well enough.</p><p>Even if you can vouch for his work, before you say yes, be sure you can put your emotions aside and write a recommendation that is convincing and sincerely positive. A lukewarm endorsement that wraps its affirmatives in veiled criticism would be unethical. If you do say yes, remember that a letter of recommendation lives or dies on its concrete examples and evidence of someone's credible accomplishments.</p><p><strong>You need an emergency dinner reservation.</strong><br />In restaurants, it's all about who you know. If you need to get into a hot spot at the last minute, explore every connection you might have to the place. Whether you know the hostess from yoga class or the owner used to play golf with your dad, remind the restaurant of this when you call. Don't, however, manufacture a dishonest ""in""; this strategy is transparent and will backfire.</p><p>If you're not a VIP, the best thing to do is be honest. Tell the person who answers the phone that you know this is crazy, but is there any chance there has been a cancellation? You just love the food, and someone is coming from out of town, and you'd positively die to have the opportunity to bring him or her in. You appreciate any help he can offer, and you'll certainly accept a place on the waiting list (just call an hour later and sweetly ask if someone can check the status of your reservation).</p><p>Some folks swear that being pushy and aggressive is the best way to land a ressie, but that's debatable. Would you want to reward someone who was rude to you? One woman reports that she always calls pretending to be her own assistant. She starts by saying, ""Hello, this is Ms. X's assistant. She is coming in with four people at eight and will need a very good table."" She says it firmly enough that she has never been denied. Most people, however, wouldn't get past hello.</p><p><strong>Your credit card is declined at a restaurant.</strong><br />First, ask yourself if you've done something that might make your server want to punish you. Some waiters have reported they get back at exceptionally rude patrons by embarrassing them in front of their dining companions.</p><p>If you think the matter is truly financial, apologize and defuse any tension by saying, ""I've been having some problems with this card lately. Will you excuse me while I make a quick call?"" Step outside and call the number on the back of your card to find out what's behind the company's refusal to accept the charge. If you've gone just over your limit, the customer service representative may be able to push the charge through. Don't be afraid to tell the rep she's in a position to save you from dying of humiliation.</p><p>If your card just plain isn't going to work and you don't have another option, tell your companion that you're mortified but you're going to need to borrow your share. If your dining partner insists on paying the bill in full, say that dinner is on you next time-and set a date to show you're serious.</p>",

It may take a few weeks before you sport spandex at the gym, but it's possible to know within 24 hours of a workout if you're exercising smart. Just look for these telltale clues.(To prevent injury, check out ""<a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/how-to-get-the-best-workout-4"">When Your Workout Isn't Working</a>"" to make sure you're feeling your exercise in all the right places, then head to <i>WH</i>'s <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/workouts"">workouts for women</a> page.)<br /><br /><b>Sign No. 1 You feel like Rocky.</b><br /><br />No, you're not slurring your words (that would be a bad sign) - you simply feel strong. What used to be a 30-minute treadmill death march now whizzes by, and you can do a pullup for the first time since, well, ever. Need numerical proof of improvement? Rate your level of ""perceived exertion"" - how challenging the workout feels - using a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 means you don't have enough breath to hold a conversation, suggests Bill Sonnemaker, C.S.C.S., director of strength and conditioning at Catalyst Fitness in Kennesaw, Georgia. If you're training properly, that number should go down every few weeks. When you dip below a 5, it's time to up the intensity. Postworkout, jot it all down in an exercise log. Our pick: <i>The New York Road Runners' 2007 Running & Fitness Log</i> ($15, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.amazon.com"">Amazon</a>). <br /><br /><b>Sign No. 2 You're positively on fire.</b><br /><br />Burning sensations during a bikini wax: bad. Burning sensations while weight training: good. ""A burning [feeling] in the muscle lets you know you're challenging the body's threshold,"" Sonnemaker says. Technically speaking, it means the body isn't producing the amount of oxygen the muscles need for energy. You should feel your muscle fibers heating up during the last third of your reps or run (and during speed bursts). If you're lifting with little exertion, add more weight. If you're running or cycling, add 1- to 2-minute sprints every 3 to 5 minutes. <br /><br /><b>Sign No. 3 Your heart recovers fast.</b><br /><br />""As your fitness improves, your heart increases its stroke volume - the amount of blood that's ejected from the heart each beat,"" says Dayna Davidson, an exercise physiologist in Tampa, Florida. ""When the heart doesn't have to pump as often, you notice a decrease in your heart rate."" A simple formula for gauging progress: Take your pulse both before and after your workout. Your heart rate should return to its preworkout rate within 5 minutes - or about as long as it takes to listen to two songs on your cooldown playlist. If it takes longer to drop, scale back your workout to avoid burnout and injury. Then crank it up gradually. If recovery takes less than 2 minutes, you're just being lazy. <br /><br /><b>Sign No. 4 You're an addict.</b><br /><br />Exercise is the most effective over-the-counter happy pill available. ""Physical activity increases the neurotransmitters that are used by your neurons to communicate with each other and can influence your mood and your response to stress,"" says Shawn Arent, Ph.D., C.S.C.S., assistant professor of exercise science at Rutgers University. And a recent study in the journal <i>Psychosomatic Medicine</i> found that regular exercisers who were forced to stop working out for 2 weeks felt tired, sad, guilty, and irritable. <br /><br />You'll most likely notice the ""high"" minutes after moderate-intensity exercise like resistance training. After a more demanding workout, such as a 5-K or a Spinning class, it will come later, because the body's first priority is recovery. If you don't feel the euphoric effect, it means either you should go harder or you're doing too many back-to-back high-intensity days. Overtraining can also lead to moodiness, Dr. Arent says. So don't overdo it. <br /><br /><b>Sign No. 5 You want to get busy.</b><br /><br />Next time the slothful (but charming) man in your life says the gym is a rip-off, explain this: Exercise turns you on. Recently, University of Texas researchers had 35 women, ages 18 to 34, cycle vigorously for 20 minutes and then watch an X-rated film. On a separate occasion, the women watched the film without working out. Researchers calculated the women's sexual response by measuring genital blood flow and discovered that it was 169 percent higher after exercising. The simple explanation: Exercise boosts blood flow down there, heightening arousal. According to Tina M. Penhollow, lead study author and professor of health promotion at Florida Atlantic University, the friskiness will last at least 20 minutes postworkout, so get home fast.<br /><br /><b>Sign No. 6 You've got insta-guns.</b><br /><br />There's a reason models do pushups and crunches before photo shoots - it makes them look more chiseled. According to Davidson, when you lift a dumbbell, your muscles contract and put pressure on the blood vessels, temporarily impeding the normal flow of oxygen and blood to the muscles. When you're done, backed-up blood rushes in and pumpsyou up, Hans. The effect lasts about half an hour. If you don't notice growth, you may not be targeting the muscle properly. Have a certified trainer okay your form. If all's well there, challenge the muscle with more weight. <br /><br /><b>Sign No. 7 You don't run from the gym to the fridge.</b><br /><br />If you're hungry after what was supposed to be a high-intensity workout, you took it too easy. ""Intense exercise tends to curb appetite,"" says Leslie Bonci, R.D., director of sports medicine nutrition at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The workout-induced appetite lull occurs because the area of the brain that regulates hunger - aka the appestat - decreases when you're hot, zapping food cravings. Exercise also stimulates the secretion of a hormone that suppresses hunger. Although you shouldn't feel hungry for 1 to 2 hours after a butt-kicking workout, you should try to eat a snack, such as a handful of trail mix, within 20 minutes to speed recovery and prevent yourself from diving headfirst into a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos when the effect wears off.<br />",

Barbara Brehm, Ed.D., chair of the department of exercise and sport studies at Smith College, suggests this isometric stabilizing exercise: Get on your hands and knees. Keeping your back flat and abs tight, raise your right arm out in front of you and your left leg straight behind you, both parallel to the floor. Hold for 30 seconds. Do three reps on each leg four times a week.</p><p>Pick landmarks before you run to avoid getting lost, says Sherry Litasi, president of the Rocky Mountain Orienteering Club. Start with a large boulder or tree you can't miss, then take off. When you get there, stop, pick another point, and run. Repeat the process until you reach your target.</p><p>Lead with your hips when running uphill, Litasi says. Fight the urge to bend forward at the waist: Staying upright will keep your chest open and allow you to fill your lungs with more oxygen. Pick up your knees to increase stride length.</p><p>Avoid locking your knees and take long strides when running downhill for better balance and less chance of falling, Litasi says. As you go, alternate quick glances at the route ahead and the ground directly in front of you. </p><p></p><br />",

But studies show you can reap major body benefits--whether you double the calories you burn in a workout or <a href=""/health/reduce-your-risk-of-breast-cancer"">reduce your risk of cancer</a>--in 60 seconds or less. That should leave plenty of time for Netflix, YouTube, Zappos... You know, the important stuff. </p><p><b>When you're at the drugstore</b><br /><b>The change:</b> read the fine print on sunscreen labels <br /><b>The benefit:</b> Better SPF protection. A recent test of sunscreen products found that 83 percent of them don't provide adequate <a href=""/beauty-and-style/sunscreen-problems-fixed"">sun protection</a>. To guard against both UVA and UVB rays, look for products that contain zinc (or zinc oxide) and titanium (or titanium dioxide). </p><p><b>On your way home from work</b><br /><b>The change:</b> Stop by the florist<br /><b>The benefit: </b>Less grouchiness the next morning. New research from Harvard University shows that even people who say they're not ""morning people"" report feeling happier and more energetic after looking at flowers first thing in the am. </p><p><b>When you first get to work</b><br /><b>The change:</b> check out a funny website <br /><b>The benefit: </b>Fewer <a href=""/health/cold-home-remedies"">colds</a>. Instead of starting your day with office e-mail, try a gutbuster from a site like Will Ferrell and co.'s funnyordie.com. Research suggests that a moment of mirth increases the body's secretion of immune-boosting growth hormones and endorphins.</p><p><b>When you skin your knee</b><br /><b>The change:</b> Dab some honey on it<br /><b>The benefit: </b>Fewer Band-aids required. A study in the International Journal of Clinical Practice shows that natural disinfectants in honey can speed healing, reduce the risk of infection, and soothe pain. Just apply a thin layer over small cuts and scrapes.</p><p><b>When you're having your annual check-up</b><br /><b>The change:</b> Tackle the tough stuff first<br /><b>The benefit:</b> A better relationship with your doctor. Research shows that patients who bring up difficult issues at the start of an appointment are more likely to be satisfied with the visit and to adhere to their M.D.'s recommendations. </p><p><b>When you want a snack</b><br /><b>The change:</b> Pop pistachios <br /><b>The benefit: </b>Improved cholesterol levels. In research at the Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls church, Virginia, people who ate two to three ounces of unsalted pistachios a day for four weeks raised their HDL cholesterol (the good kind) by 6 percent. Buy them pre-shelled to save your nails, too.</p><p><b>During a DIY Pedi</b><br /><b>The change:</b> Examine your feet <br /><b>The benefit:</b> Early skin-cancer detection. Melanoma can develop even in places that don't see much sun. The three most common on the feet: the soles, between the toes, and around or under the toenails. See a doc if you notice spots that are new or asymmetrical or that change in size, color, or thickness. </p><p><b>When you're yawning at 3 P.M.</b><br /><b>The change: </b>Choose coffee over cola<br /><b>The benefit:</b> Reduceddiabetes risk. coffee has fewer cals and more antioxidants than most sodas--and a Finnish study found that folks who drank three to six cups per day were 50 percent less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who sipped two cups or less. </p><p><b>Duringthe week before your period</b><br /><b>The change: </b>Order a glass of wine with dinner <br /><b>The benefit: </b>Less PMS. The study of Women's Health across the Nation recently linked moderate alcohol consumption (about one drink per day) to fewer pre-period mood changes and headaches.</p><p><b>When you're making burritos for dinner</b><br /><b>The change: </b>Swap in a blue tortilla for a white one<br /><b>The benefit: </b>Fewer late-night hunger pangs. scientists in Mexico recently found that blue tortillas contain 20 percent more hunger-satisfying protein and 16 percent less blood-sugar-spiking starch than white ones.</p><p><b>When you're craving a cigarette</b><br /><b>The change:</b> Drink milk<br /><b>The benefit:</b> Less-satisfying smoke breaks. in a recent survey of smokers from Duke University, nearly 20 percent agreed that milk makes cigarettes taste bad. ""Your brain can eventually connect the taste of milk with a decreased desire to smoke,"" says lead researcher Joseph McClernon, Ph.D. </p><p><b>When you're waiting for the weight machine at the gym</b><br /><b>The change: </b>Skip rope<br /><b>The benefit:</b> Mega calorie frying.

Nowadays they're words every sensible person lives in fear of. We've lost more than 4 million jobs since December 2007, and the <a target=""_self"" href=""/experts/find-a-job"">unemployment rate</a> rose to 8.1 percent earlier this year, the highest it's been since the Reagan era. Meaning the odds are better than ever that you could get a not-so-welcome visit from your human resources representative. And even if he or she doesn't use the same blunt-force phrase Donald Trump is so fond of, the message is the same: It's been nice, but you're no longer needed.</p><p>Before you surrender to a Snuggie-swaddled existence in front of the tube, take a good long yoga breath. Though scary and disruptive, being laid off doesn't have to destroy you. In fact, if you take the right steps, you can use the time off to move <a target=""_self"" href=""/life/get-the-career-you-want"">your career</a> and life forward, says career coach Cynthia Shapiro, author of <i>What Does Somebody Have to Do to Get a Job Around Here?</i> Here's how to handle everything, from the immediate aftermath to the months ahead.</p><p><b>Dealing on D-Day</b><br />Follow this advice to end your tour of duty without regret and maybe even with a few options. </p><p><b>Don't burn bridges</b> Who hasn't fantasized about flipping off the boss or giving the HR guy a piece of her mind? As tempting as it may be, keep it a fantasy. The fact is, most of your future <a href=""/life/love-your-job"">employment</a> options will stem from this job, whether through connections, contract work, or recommendations. ""As hard as it is to do, try to make it easy on your boss,"" says career expert Nicole Williams, author of <i>Earn What You're Worth</i>. ""I've had to lay people off, and it sucks. But if you respond with grace and dignity, I'll call every person I know to try to help you. And I'll want to hire you back later if possible.""</p><p><b>Shut down the water works</b> No one will begrudge you a few tears, but hold back on the jilted-Bachelorette ""why me?"" routine, Williams says. And don't blab about financial difficulties, like revealing mid-meltdown that you won't be able to pay your rent. Not only is it not very dignified, but you're also tipping your hand that you're desperate, which puts you in a weak position when it comes to severance pay or freelance work later.</p><p><b>Ask if there's some other option</b> It's possible that management hasn't thought of alternative solutions, such as shifting you to a four-day workweek or having you telecommute to save on overhead costs. See if they're open to some arrangement that would keep you on and still save them money, Williams says. </p><p><b>Find out what they'll give you to go away</b> Ask about severance packages and review company policies or contracts to find out if you're entitled to anything, Shapiro says. Sadly, unless you have a contract that specifies, companies aren't required to give you any parting gifts. But if they do offer a separation package, you can negotiate-for example, by asking for extended health insurance in addition to a cash payout. And inquire about being paid for unused vacation days, too.</p><p><b>Take your time</b> HR may be pushing you to sign papers while your head is still spinning. Feel free to ask for a few days to review your severance package and any other documents, such as a separation agreement that waives your rights to sue the company. Don't sign anything with a ""noncompete clause""-this means the company is barring you from working for their competition for a certain amount of time, which probably shoots down your best option for immediate employment, Shapiro says. If you really don't like or understand what you see, have a lawyer look it over. </p><p></p><p><b>The Days After</b><br />In this weakened economy, you can expect it to take at least six months to a year to find a new job, Williams says. Use that time to protect yourself from financial mistakes and to plot out the next step in your career. </p><p><b>File for unemployment</b> Don't be embarrassed-you're entitled to that money. (And now that most of the process is handled online or via phone, you don't have to stand in the dreaded unemployment line.) But do it immediately. It normally takes a few weeks to process unemployment benefits, but with the recent surge in layoffs, it may take even longer. ""Unemployment offices are overwhelmed,"" Shapiro says. ""You can't count on that money right away.""</p><p><b>Seek coverage</b> Since Murphy's Law dictates that you'll break your arm the day after your insurance runs out, get that settled fast. (Insurers also take several weeks to determine your eligibility, so waiting even a day or two could leave you at risk.) If you had company-sponsored health care, you can continue it through the federal COBRA plan for a while; you can also look into other options through organizations such as your college alumni association or other business groups, Shapiro says. </p><p><b>Protect your retirement funds</b> If you have more than $5,000 in your 401(k), you can either keep it there or roll it into an IRA, Shapiro says. If you have less than five Gs, you'll probably have to roll it over, as most companies won't keep less than $5,000 in their 401(k) programs. Unless you're absolutely broke, don't cash out: You'll be selling at the bottom of the market and losing a ton of money. And you'll be hit with early-withdrawal taxes and penalties, leaving you with even less. </p><p><b>Take care of yourself</b> During this rough time, focus on SEED: Sleep, Eat, Exercise, and Drink (water), says Ariane de Bonvoisin, author of <i>The First 30 Days: Your Guide to Making Any Change Easier</i>, and the website First30days.com. ""When you go through any change, these are the four things that go out the window, she says. ""If you don't know what to do right now, focus on your health. It's the best commitment you can make to yourself."" Although you may want to do nothing but watch Judge Judy all day, keep up with your hobbies and social activities too. They'll help boost your mood-and they could be great networking opportunities as well. </p><p><b>Craft your story</b> A lot of people are going to ask you what happened, and when they do, you'll have a choice to make: Cast yourself as the victim and tear the company to shreds, or say, ""Hey, I had a good run. It's time for something new,"" de Bonvoisin says. Your impulse may be to indulge in self-pity, but that will only drain your energy in the end. Putting a positive spin on the situation will help you feel better and keep you motivated to start over. And you'll show others that you're mature enough to handle adversity without bitterness, which will make them more inclined to help you. </p><p><b>Hit the want ads</b> It's fine to take a few days off, maybe even a week or so, to calm down and figure out what types of jobs you want to pursue. But set a specific date for getting back out there, says Williams, ""because one week can turn into two weeks, then a month."" Even if you're not ready to send out your résumé, you can plug in your criteria on job-search engines like SimplyHired.com and Indeed.com, and sign up for e-mail notifications when positions become available so you can see what's out there. </p><p><b>Spread the word</b> Call, e-mail, or Facebook everyone in your sphere and let them know you're looking-you never know who might be in a position to help. ""My first business investor was my next-door neighbor,"" Williams says. ""Before I struck up a conversation, I never would have guessed he could help me.""</p><p><b>Set goals</b> No doubt your No. 1 goal is to get a job, but setting smaller targets will help keep you on track. For example, business consultant Keith Ferrazzi, author of <i>Who's Got Your Back?</i>, suggests setting weekly objectives, such as ""I will meet with four contacts this week"" or ""I will sign up for a class."" This reinforces your sense of accomplishment, even if you haven't found a job. ""And most of all, keep reminding yourself what a tremendous opportunity this is to redefine what's next for you,"" he says.</p><p> </p><p></p><p><b>When a Friend Gets the Call</b><br />By Kim O'Brien<br />Talking to a friend who's just been laid off can be fraught with well meaning but completely misguided blubbering. So if your girl gets the axe, here are the words to stay away from, and what you can say to be there for her. <br /><b></b></p><p><b>Don't say:</b> ""<i>How about </i>ANTM<i> last night?</i>"" Don't brush off the topic. ""One of the things that people do is try to offer a distraction,"" says David Eigen, PhD, a psychologist and author. "" But this only negates the emotions that are there."" <br /><b>Instead:</b> Just let her vent. Sometimes listening is the best thing you can do. <br /><b></b></p><p><b>Don't say:</b> <i>""Everything happens for a reason.""</i> She's allowed to say that, but you're not. ""It's patronizing and diminishes the wild ride of emotions your friend is going through,"" says Debra Condren, a business psychologist and author of<i>Ambition is Not a Dirty Word</i>. <br /><b>Instead:</b> Help your pal evaluate her current situation. Does she need to apply for unemployment? Find a place to live? Get her resume together? ""She needs to put aside the emotions for a minute and think rationally about the practical questions she needs to ask in the here and now-and you can assist her in doing that,"" says Condren.</p><p><b>Don't say:</b> <i>""I know somebody who knows somebody...""</i> Sure you're trying to be helpful, but don't bombard your friend with job prospects and advice. She's dealing with a lot at the moment, and an onslaught of information may push her deeper into depression and confusion. <br /><b>Instead:</b> Ask if she want any leads, says Eigen. If she says yes, then go ahead and tell her about people who you know who can help. If not, wait a few days, then offer to provide her with some job possibilities once the initial shock has worn off.</p>",cooking
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/improve-your-meals,Nutrition,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,,first class foods,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0410-first-foods-0019.jpg,"An upgrade is a beautiful thing. For the relatively low price of a friendly, commiserating smile and a politely phrased question, you jump from economy to first class, compact to midsize, or two double beds and a TV to a four-room hotel suite. What's not to love? In the spirit of easily added value, we've found 12 simple mealtime tricks that transform ordinary foods from pedestrian plate-fillers to nutritional powerhouses. <br /><br /><b>The Food: Tuna salad</b><br /><b>The Upgrade: Red bell pepper</b><br />Got leftover tuna salad? Stuff it into a red bell pepper, and skip the tired bread and lettuce approach. Red peppers and other red-fleshed produce, such as tomatoes, watermelons, and ruby-red grapefruit, are high in lycopene, a phytochemical that can significantly reduce a woman's risk of developing heart disease, according to Harvard scientists. Bake the pepper and you'll make it even more potent; heat makes lycopene easier for your body to absorb.<br /><br /><b>The Food: Tea</b><br /><b>The Upgrade: Honey</b><br />Sure, honey packs a few more calories than table sugar. But it packs more health benefits, too. According to a recent study from the United Arab Emirates, people who ate 4 tablespoons of natural honey daily reduced several markers of cardiovascular disease and lowered their blood sugar levels. Lead researcher Noori Al-Waili, M.D., Ph.D, credits trace amounts of minerals, such as zinc and copper, which may help keep glucose metabolism and insulin levels in check.<br /><br /><b>The Food: Pancakes</b><br /><b>The Upgrade: Sorghum syrup</b><br />Move over, Aunt Jemima: A better syrup has come to take your place at the breakfast table. ""Sorghum syrup is one of the best, most concentrated sources of dietary antioxidants - period,"" says Cheryl Forberg, R.D., author of <i>Stop the Clock! Cooking</i>. Like grits, sorghum syrup is more widely available in the South. But you can find it at specialty food stores all over the country.<br /><br /><b>The Food: Chili</b><br /><b>The Upgrade: Chocolate</b><br />It may sound weird, but try dropping a couple of chunks of chocolate into your pot of chili. Your chili will taste better (trust us). And you'll feel better, knowing that the flavonoids and polyphenols in chocolate can lower your risk of heart disease by 20 percent and keep LDL (bad) cholesterol from oxidizing into an artery-damaging form. Dark, or semisweet, chocolate has more of the beneficial compounds than other types.<br /><br /><b>The Food: Grilled fish</b><br /><b>The Upgrade: Citrus zest</b><br />That little umbrella might not help much, but the strip of citrus peel perched on the rim of your cocktail may cut your cancer risk. In a University of Arizona study, people who ate lemon zest - scrapings from the fruit's rind - reduced their likelihood of developing skin cancer by 30 percent. ""Eating as little as 1 tablespoon of zest per week is enough to make a significant difference,"" says study author Iman Hakim, M.D., Ph.D. Buy a zester and add a peel to salads and grilled fish.<br /><br /><b>The Food: Yogurt</b><br /><b>The Upgrade: Real fruit</b><br />That muck on the bottom of most yogurts has more fructose - as in high-fructose corn syrup - than it has fruit. In addition to inflating the calorie count, high-fructose corn syrup can significantly increase blood levels of triglycerides, raising your risk of heart disease. Opt for plain yogurt instead, and toss in raisins or dried pineapple. Dehydrated fruit offers all the health benefits of regular fruit, just concentrated.<br /><br /><b>The Food: Chicken</b><br /><b>The Upgrade: Salsa</b><br />Think of salsa as a vegetable, and eat it as often as you can. ""Just take a chicken breast, pour salsa over it, and throw it in the oven - you've got an instant healthy meal,"" says Cynthia Sass, R.D., author of <i>Your Diet Is Driving Me Crazy</i>. Most salsa has no fat, no sugar, only 4 calories per tablespoon, and as little as 70 milligrams (mg) of sodium. You can't say the same for most barbecue or honey mustard sauces.<br /><br /><b>The Food: Bagels</b><br /><b>The Upgrade: Fruit spread</b><br />You could buy your own produce stand in order to keep up with the National Cancer Institute's recommended five to nine daily servings of fruits and vegetables. Or you could just buy your fruit in a jar. One tablespoon of unsweetened fruit spread (not sugary jelly or jam) on your morning bagel counts as one of the day's servings, says David Grotto, R.D., director of nutrition education at the Block Center for Integrative Cancer Care in Evanston, Illinois. Look for brands with a high vitamin content like Crofters Organic.<br /><br /><b>The Food: Pizza</b><br /><b>The Upgrade: Oregano</b><br />More oregano makes for a more powerful pizza. A tablespoon of fresh oregano (not the dried, bottled kind) has a higher antioxidant yield than an entire apple, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture researchers. Bonus: Calorie counts for most herbs and spices are nonexistent. The same can't be said for other pizza toppings like, say, extra cheese.<br /><br /><b>The Food: Oatmeal</b><br /><b>The Upgrade: Flax</b><br />Follow the scent of patchouli to your local health emporium and buy a bag of ground flaxseed. Add 3 or 4 tablespoons to cereal or oatmeal. Ground flaxseed contains omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and compounds called lignans - nutrients that can reduce your risk of colon cancer, heart disease, and age-related vision loss. ""You can consume flaxseed as an oil,"" Grotto says, ""but the oil contains more calories and fewer lignans."" <br /><br /><b>The Food: Salads</b><br /><b>The Upgrade: Spinach</b><br />Banish iceberg lettuce from your salads and sandwiches; it has about as much nutritional value as it has taste. ""Spinach gives you more bang for the buck,"" says Forberg. A cup of spinach is an excellent source of folate (58 micrograms), which may help reduce your risk of heart attack and is an important nutrient for expectant mothers. <br /><br /><b>The Food: Marinara sauce</b><br /><b>The Upgrade: Garlic</b><br />Whole garlic is good; crushed garlic is better. Cutting the clove is what causes a chemical compound called alliin to morph into allicin - the stuff that gives garlic its kick. According to researchers at Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science, allicin acts as an antimicrobial agent, doing hand-to-hand combat with infections by scrambling their building-block enzymes.<br /><br />",cooking

He was actually hogging half of two spaces, making it impossible for anyone to park in either of them. When I asked him to pull forward a few feet, he refused and walked away. I could have let this pass. But then I spotted a hot dog vendor on the other side of the street. So I bought a sausage sandwich with extra onions, smeared it all over his windshield, and left him a note reading: ""How's your day working out now?""<br /><br />My <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/alpha-wives"">wife</a> and 22-year-old daughter think it's idiotic when I do this kind of stuff, but my 20-year-old son thinks it's fabulous. That's because he understands that men cannot - and will not - let things go. It would ruin our lives if we did.<br /><br /><b>Tense Present</b><br /><br />Women have a different relationship with grudges than men do. They have a hard time letting go of things in the past, while men have a hard time letting go of things in the present. Women remember missed anniversaries, insensitive comments, personal slights, appalling gifts, dreary vacations. They're famous for exhuming old <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/negotiate-conflicts"">arguments</a>, for reviving debates that their male counterparts thought were dead and buried years ago. When women refuse to let it go, it's usually because the offending party - a spouse, a boyfriend - is guilty of a crime suggesting a serious flaw in moral character. The only way to prevent these failings from reappearing in the future is to continually remind the man of his crimes in the past. <br /><br />While men may not dredge up the past as women do, we often refuse to let an argument go until our position is vindicated. Men want women to admit that getting off I-84 and taking local roads to Boston is a stupid error in judgment, an error compounded when she later takes 295 instead of I-95 to Philly. Men want women to admit that recycling newsprint makes no economic sense, that Alan Alda is a dink, that <i>True Romance</i> is one of the 10 greatest movies of all time, that the infield fly rule is not impossible to understand. <br /><br />Men are forever willing to risk life, limb, and ridicule in defense of a dubious principle. My daughter's <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/communication-advice"">boyfriend</a> once returned a rental truck to a dangerous neighborhood in the Bronx at 11 o'clock at night just because he was furious that the company had lied about being able to drop it off in a safe neighborhood in Manhattan without paying an overnight rental fee. My daughter was in the car at the time. She thinks he should have just let it go. <br /><br />Men are particularly implacable when the argument involves something unimportant. I once forced my wife to watch the closing credits of the tearjerker <i>Brief Encounter</i> just to prove that it was not Raymond Massey playing Trevor Howard's best friend - that the very suggestion was ridiculous. I did this because I felt that such a reproof would deter her from subsequently asking, ""Was that a young Billy Crystal playing Sonny Corleone in <i>The Godfather</i>?"" But this approach never works, because my wife does not care about being wrong, especially when it involves somebody named Billy. Or Sonny. <br /><br />I recently asked a group of male friends to provide examples of things they could not let go of. In almost every case, the men found it necessary to defend some imaginary principle, while the women were content to take the path of least resistance and get on with it. ""My neighbor hires an army of workers to blow leaves during the week when I'm trying to work,"" reported one self-employed friend. ""So every Sunday night, I cut my lawn at dinnertime. Sometimes I wait till my neighbor's getting settled in his hammock before turning on the weed whacker. My wife hates the idea of pissing off the neighbors, but I enjoy it.""<br /><br /><b>Feel-Good Moments</b><br /><br />Here we come to a key point: When men refuse to let go, it is generally because we derive pleasure from it. I recently read somewhere that a staggeringly large number of men engage in punitive behavior on the highway, going out of their way to even the score with drivers who cut them off. This is the way we are. If cut off, we retaliate. If jostled, we jostle back. We kick the seat in front of us on airplanes when the passenger suddenly jerks the seat back. We will not tolerate disrespect, even when no disrespect is intended. Given half a chance, most men would behead another man who jumps from the back of one line to the front of a new queue when the innocent cashier opens the register and says, ""Next customer, please.""<br /><br />The problem with this philosophy is that it makes life complicated. My wife is constantly pleading with me to let things go, if only for logistical reasons: The number of times a guy encounters other guys who annoy him means he faces confrontations a dozen times a day. The pig who steals his parking space. The bike messenger who nearly kills him. The bozo ranting into his cell phone an inch from his ear.<br /><br />To avoid spending our entire lives retaliating, we sometimes develop elaborate coping mechanisms, a la my sausage-smearing incident. By doing this, I built up a tidy psychic reservoir that let me ignore the next five guys who stole my parking space because I'd screwed one guy really good. Subconsciously, a lot of men let things go for a while and then wreak all their vengeance on the 10th guy to mess with them. The 10th guy is often a hapless geek.<br /><br />I would love to believe that men will one day master anger management techniques and learn to let things go. But the truth is, guys like getting in each other's faces. I thoroughly enjoyed confronting the four frat boys who spilled beer on my son's pants at a Rolling Stones concert last fall. And I enjoyed telling a short drunk at another Stones concert: ""I wasn't actually seeking any input from the Hobbit community.""<br /><br />Last fall, I nearly got into a fistfight with a nitwit at a field hockey game. The man was standing right in front of me. When I asked him to move, he shocked me - and his far more intelligent girlfriend - by calling me an asshole. He immediately regretted it, and even though I knew he regretted it, I had to get right in his face and tell him menacingly that in the future he should choose his words more carefully. Why did I need to do this? To humiliate him? To emasculate him? No, I was motivated by pure altruism. If I let this ninny call me an asshole, he might say the same to an even bigger guy, and then he'd get his lights punched out. In other words, I was doing him a favor.<br /><br />The very notion that a man would think he was doing another man a favor by threatening to kick his ass provides a pretty clear idea of how twisted we are as a gender. We cannot let things go, even when there is good reason to, because we are biologically programmed not to let things go. For the clearest illustration of the difference between men and women, you only needed to study the facial expression of the woman accompanying the jerk at the hockey game. Her expression read: Yes, he was an asshole to call you an asshole. But you're an asshole to treat him like the world's biggest asshole just because he called you an asshole. Why can't you assholes just let it go?<br /><br />Maybe it's because we're assholes. <br /><br /><br /><i>Joe Queenan lives in Tarrytown, New York, where he's been having the same feud with a local merchant since 1987.

It was a cashier at the Gap, and we were chatting about my <a href=""/health/pregnancy-perks"">pregnancy</a> while she rang up some jeans with elastic waistbands. ""Your husband must be so excited,"" she said.</p><p>There was an awkward pause before I quickly explained that there was no husband, that I was in my thirties, hadn't found The Guy, and had decided to have a baby on my own.</p><p>Her eyes went wide. ""Wow,"" she said, ""you're so brave.""</p><p>That's when I burst out laughing. I'm not the brave type at all. I'm afraid of everything, from dark streets to spiders, and frankly, I was terrified to have a child on my own. I mean, I knew what I was getting into-I bought donor sperm from a sperm bank, and went to a fertility clinic to have the stuff shot into my uterus on the exact day that I was ovulating. But being a <a href=""/health/what-traits-do-you-inherit"">single mother</a> was never a dream of mine.</p><p>The truth is, like most women out there, I expected to get married and have a family. But at 37, I found myself at a crossroads: I was two and a half years into a relationship with a smart, handsome guy, but we didn't see eye-to-eye on core values, and we argued. A lot. I worried that if we got married, we'd likely get divorced. And while I didn't think it would be ideal for a child to have just a <a href=""/life/motherhood"">mother</a>, I was fairly sure that I could provide a stable, happy home on my own. </p><p>I also knew I wasn't exactly blazing uncharted territory; census data show that <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/modern-happy-marriages"">unmarried women</a> are responsible for 36 percent of all births. I could do this. So I traded the boyfriend for a vial of sperm and got myself knocked up. </p><p>Over the next few months, it seemed like everyone who saw my belly and my naked ring finger said the same thing that Gap cashier did, and each time, I felt like a fraud. ""Look,"" I wanted to say, ""I'm far from an independent superwoman. I can't even change the water filter in my fridge by myself. I simply want to be a <a href=""/life/mom-know-best"">mother</a>!""</p><p>Actually, ""simply"" doesn't describe it. I'd always loved kids, and I couldn't imagine going through life without one of my own. But I didn't feel I could afford the time to go looking for the boyfriend I would marry within a year so we could have babies before my fertility began to evaporate.</p><p>I felt as if I'd won the lottery when I found out I was pregnant. Then the nausea hit, and the reality that there was nobody to bring me Preggie Pops sunk in. I went to prenatal appointments alone, carried groceries up the stairs to my apartment alone, and made important decisions about life insurance and wills-alone. There were times when I desperately wished I had a husband to lean on-like the day I tried to sit down at my desk and, off balance, I missed the chair entirely and landed on the floor. I was in my third trimester and freaked out that I'd hurt the baby. And it would have been nice to have a father to help when the baby came five weeks early and I hadn't even set up the nursery yet.</p><p>One day during my maternity leave, I ventured out to a museum opening and was admiring a painting when someone called my name. It was an acquaintance I hadn't seen for a while who was there with a group of other unattached friends. As soon as I turned around, she saw my bundle of joy strapped to my chest, scanned my hand for a wedding ring, and gave me the perplexed look that had become so familiar. I explained that I'd had a baby on my own. </p><p>I knew what came next: ""Wow,"" she said, ""you're so brave."" Then she added the other phrase I had heard so often and chosen to ignore: ""I don't know how you do it. I could never do it myself.""</p><p>I smiled weakly as she and her friends looked over my shoulder for the cute single men they'd come to find. That's when it hit me: We usually use the word brave not for people whose circumstances we admire but for people who have experienced misfortune beyond their control-like recovering from a terrible illness. Sheryl Crow probably heard the word <i>brave</i> just as often during her cancer treatments as when she adopted her son sans husband.</p><p><i>Brave</i> seemed to be code for ""Thank God I'm not in your situation."" To that group of women at the museum looking at me, a single woman trying to calm a crying infant while juggling a bottle and a bulging diaper bag, I was a cautionary tale. </p><p>Three years later, I certainly don't feel like a cautionary tale. I feel like I made what turned out to be the best decision of my life. I didn't choose to be single, but I did choose to become a mother. And it's because of this choice that I get to wake up every day to a hilarious toddler in the next room. The experience has, in a way, given me freedom I'd never experienced before. It taught me that we don't get to order a life plan like we order takeout: ""I'll have one loving husband, two adorable kids, one flexible but exciting career, one healthy body, and the ability to travel, with the dressing on the side."" Nobody's life is tied up that neatly in a bow-not even my married friends'. </p><p><b>Sound off</b><br /><a href=""/life/motherhood"">Should we feature more stories about being a mom?</a><br /></p>",Decode Him

But as you remember from the physiology of metabolism, you have to eat more often to change your body composition. The new philosophy to keep in mind is ""energy balance.""</p><p>Researchers at Georgia State University developed a technique to measure hourly energy balance-that is, how many calories you're burning versus how many calories you're taking in. The researchers found that if you keep your hourly surplus or deficit within 300 to 500 calories at all times, you will best be able to change your body composition by losing fat and adding lean muscle mass. Those subjects with the largest energy imbalances (those who were over 500 calories in either ingestion or expenditure) were the fattest, while those with the most balanced energy levels were the leanest. </p><p><b>Eat Like a Human, Not Like a Condo</b><br />If you only eat your three squares a day, you're creating terrific imbalances in your energy levels. Between meals, you're burning many more calories than you're taking in. At mealtimes, you're taking in many more than you're burning. </p><p>Research shows that this kind of eating plan is great-if your dream is to be a high-rise condo. But if you want to look slimmer, feel fitter, find those <a href=""/weight-loss/get-amazing-abs"">sexy abs</a> that are hiding, and-not coincidentally-live longer, then you need to <a href=""/fitness/diet-foods-for-abs-of-steel"">eat more often</a>. In the same study, subjects who added three snacks a day to three regular meals balanced out their energy better, lost fat, and increased lean body mass (as well as increased their power and endurance). </p><p>In a similar study, researchers in Japan found that athletes who ate the same amount of calories a day from either two or six meals both lost an average of 11 pounds in 2 weeks. But the ones who ate six meals a day lost 3 pounds more fat and 3 pounds less muscle than the ones who ate only two meals. </p><p><b>Keep the Fuel Gauge Steady</b><br />There's science to support the fact that more meals work, but the plain-speak reason it works is because it does something that many diets don't do: It keeps you full and satiated, which will reduce the likelihood of a diet-destroying binge.<br />How it works: For scheduling purposes, alternate your larger meals with smaller snacks. Eat two of your snacks roughly 2 hours before lunch and dinner and one snack roughly 2 hours after dinner. </p><p><b>Sample time schedule: </b><br /><br />8 a.m.: breakfast<br />11 a.m.: snack<br />1 p.m.: lunch<br />4 p.m.: snack<br />6 p.m.: dinner<br />8 p.m.: snack</p><p>Got it?

""You'd have to be an idiot to pay full price,"" he said. Case in point: He paid $1,900 for his $3,500 Silver Dream. Huh, I thought. I can <a href=""/life/money-saving-tips"">haggle</a>. The next day, I decided to make my own mattress deal. I had my eye on a similarly priced model-- a $3,400 Stearns & Foster-- and tried to convince the salesman to give it to me for $2,000. Then $2,500. Then $2,800. No matter what I did, he barely budged. The best he could do? $3,000.</p><p>As I turned to leave, he didn't follow me with a ""Wait, maybe I can go lower,"" as I assumed he would. What's more, I could swear I heard him chuckle, as if he was shaking his head and thinking, ""Silly girl."" I walked out deflated--and <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/makeup-sex"">pissed off</a>. ""Maybe you just didn't push hard enough,"" Bryce said when I shared my frustration.</p><p>""And maybe men just get better deals!"" I shot back.</p><p>I had to wonder: Are women more likely to get screwed, no matter how great their <a href=""/life/get-great-deals"">bargaining</a> prowess--or are men just better at it? It might be a little of both, says Carol Frohlinger, a New York City-based lawyer and negotiating expert and coauthor of <i>Her Place at the Table</i>. ""For a lot of men, negotiating is the perfect challenge for a gender that's been groomed to be competitive,"" she says. ""Plus, most salespeople expect men to haggle but not women.""</p><p>Are you destined to pay full price? Hell, no. You can score good deals just by tweaking guys' haggling how-tos.</p><p><b>He exudes confidence</b><br />You may not even recognize your usually bashful guy when he's on the phone with the cable company after they've raised your rate. ""Men often go into a bargaining situation with the attitude, 'If you want my business, you will help me out,' and in most cases, it works,"" Frohlinger says. </p><p><i><b>Your turn </b></i>Be your usual pleasant self--to a point. Just as men are conditioned to compete, women learn to be likable. It's that drive toward niceness that undermines women when the bargaining needs to get down and dirty. But you can use your instinctual empathy to your advantage. For instance, if you notice another customer being rude to a salesperson, compensate for that by being really nice when it's your turn to ask for help. But even if you've established a friendly rapport, keep in mind that you probably won't be dealing with that particular salesperson again, so don't feel uncomfortable if it gets a little heated. </p><p><b>He channels his inner tech geek</b><br />When you think about the amount of time your guy spends looking at cars, electronics, and other gadgets online, it's no wonder he's able to snag great deals. He's more likely to know the going price for whatever it is he's shopping for and sniff out someone who's trying to rip him off. </p><p><i><b>Your turn</b></i>Cram like you did for final exams. You might consider scrubbing the mold out of the shower grout more fun than scouring <i>Consumer Reports</i>, but doing your homework will help you know what's worth top dollar and what's not. ""Some car salesmen believe women shoppers are ignorant about the car business, and they'll try to take advantage of that,"" says Michael Royce, founder of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.beatthecarsalesman.com"">beatthecarsalesman.com</a>. So make those unenlightened sales guys do a double take. Simply check out a few websites for crucial pieces of information (like the invoice price and true market value of a car) that will arm you with enough info to know if someone's trying to pull a fast one on you. </p><p><b>He turns getting a deal into a game</b><br />Maybe it's his hunter lineage or that passion for competition, but when your man scores a deep discount, odds are he'll beam like he did when his team clinched the World Series. Why? Because it means he won.</p><p><i><b>Your turn </b></i>Have some fun trying to get a bargain. If you think of negotiating as a challenge rather than something to dread, you'll be more likely to keep trying until you succeed. Also, remember that you've got the upper hand in these situations (read: you can choose who you're up against). Not psyched about the sales guy who's talking to your boyfriend instead of you--even though you're the one plunking down the plastic? Ask to work with someone else. ""One of the reasons women get ripped off is that we spend some time with a salesman, and then we feel reluctant to walk away,"" says Joanne Helperin, a senior editor for edmunds.com, a review, rating, and advice site for car shoppers. ""Men are more likely to vote with their feet and leave if they sense they're not going to come out on top. You should, too.""</p>",healthy eating

Is it wild or farmed? What method was used to catch it? If the fishmonger doesn't know or won't answer, find a new place to shop. <br /><br />CATCH<br /><br /><b>Barramundi: </b><br />You'll be seeing more of this flaky, flavorful fresh water bass, which is very popular in its native Australia. An environmentalist's dream, it doesn't eat other sea life and it's farmed in recirculating ponds that don't pollute nearby waters.<br /><br /><b>Cod and Halibut (Pacific):</b><br />Both Pacific varieties are still abundant in the wild, and the fisheries are well managed and safe for surrounding environments.<br /><br /><b>Domestic Crab/Lobster:</b><br />Not in the mood to <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/experts/inspecting-your-seafood"">buy fish</a> today? No problem, try crabs and lobsters, which are caught in pots or traps. They also pose no risk to other sea life. Most crab species remain plentiful, except Alaskan snow crab and Russian king crab, which should always be avoided. In the U.S., young lobsters are thrown back to breed another day.<br /><br /><b>Shellfish:</b><br />Clams, mussels, oysters, and scallops are either caught wild or farm-raised. Because shellfish filter water, these farms may actually benefit the surrounding ecosystem, unlike many other fish-raising facilities.<br /><br /><b>Domestic Shrimp:</b><br />Shrimp live fast, reproduce with abandon, and die young. No danger of our depleting them. But shrimp harvesters catch more than just shrimp in their nets -- they nab sea turtles, too. Which is why North American shrimp fishers have switched to turtle-friendly rigs. Other countries haven't -- and we import 90 percent of our shrimp. Some foreign shrimp farmers also raze water forests and wetlands to make ponds, then dump in chemicals to prevent disease.<br /><br /><b>Striped Bass:</b><br />Government intervention in the '80s saved this species. Wild striped bass are caught using methods that don't hurt other sea life. And farmed hybrid striped bass (a mix of stripers and white bass) are raised in nonpolluting recirculating ponds.<br /><br /><b>Domestic Swordfish:</b><br />Atlantic populations have resurged, though not to former levels. Avoid imported, which are caught by long-lining, a process that often kills turtles, dolphins, and birds.<br /><br /><b>Tilapia:</b><br />This farmed fish with a mild, trout-like flavor doesn't eat much marine life. In the U.S., it's raised in enclosed, ecofriendly ponds. <br /><br />RELEASE<br /><br /><b>Bluefin Tuna:</b><br />A prized large bluefin, which is sold in sushi bars as maguro and toro, can command $100,000. Thus, they're being hunted to extinction. A more fish-friendlychoice is big-eye or yellowfin (also known as ahi). Canned tuna is usually yellowfin, skipjack, or albacore -- which are stable despite heavy fishing -- so eat occasionally.<br /><br /><b>Chilean Sea Bass:</b><br />Also sold as Patagonian, black hake, and icefish, this species doesn't reproduce until it's 10 years old, so it isn't getting enough time to make babies. Despite bans, pirate fishing has depleted the populations. If you like the taste, substitute Alaskan black cod.<br /><br /><b>Cod and Halibut (Atlantic):</b><br />Once the most plentiful source of cod in the world, the Canadian Atlantic is now tapped out due to overfishing, and New England's waters are similarly threatened. Atlantic halibut is in the same boat.<br /><br /><b>Grouper:</b><br />Huge schools of groupers use the same breeding areas each year. Fishermen know these locations and have seriously depleted the population. If you like the taste, have wild striped bass instead.<br /><br /><b>Farm-Raised Salmon:</b><br />Salmon are carnivores. It takes 3 pounds of fish meal (made of wild sardines, mackerel, and anchovies) to produce 1 pound of salmon. They're also raised in offshore pens, so their waste poisons the surrounding habitat. Instead choosewild, line-caught Alaskan salmon, also high in omega-3s, or Arctic char, which tastes like a cross between salmon and trout and is raised in ecofriendly tanks.<br /><br /><b>Shark:</b><br />All species are overfished, and three (great white, whale, and basking) are threatened. It takes sharks years to grow and reproduce. The spiny dogfish shark is pregnant for 2 years. <br /><br />Try our<a href=""http://recipes.womenshealthmag.com/homepage.aspx""> Recipe Finder </a>to discover new ways to cook these bad boys.<br />","healthy eating,cooking"

But by day two or three, your palate is craving something more sophisticated than some white meat and mayo slapped between two pieces of bread.<br /><br />Thankfully, the golden-roasted gobbler--one of the best sources of low-calorie, muscle-sculpting protein--is surprisingly versatile.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/health-insurance-scams,Health,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,,Can You Have Your Identity Stolen at the Hospital?,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0810-watch-your-back.jpg,"<p>Last February, Maija Lamberts opened her mailbox and, amid a handful of junk mail and coupon circulars, found a statement for a <a target=""_blank"" href=""/health/the-top-doctors-in-america"">health-care</a> credit card she'd never requested. Immediately, her scam radar went up. A quick call to the company revealed that a stranger had used the card to give herself a $24,000 extreme makeover--<a href=""/life/breast-augmentation-and-botox"">breast implants</a>, a tummy tuck, and liposuction. Two weeks later, when the suspect showed up at the surgeon's office for a follow-up visit, the cops were there waiting for her. </p><p>The 39-year-old pharmaceutical-sales rep had just become a victim of medical identity theft, a new scheme that criminals use to get free health services and leave you to clean up the mess. Since then, Lamberts has spent months trying to untangle the bills, <a href=""/life/avoid-credit-debt"">get out of debt</a>, and restore her tarnished credit. ""Even though I caught the crime quickly, it devastated my finances,"" she says. ""Suddenly I'm scared of losing my house. My security has been yanked out from under me.""</p><p>Lamberts is one of the 250,000 identity theft victims the Federal Trade Commission estimates fall prey to medical identity theft every year. The offense can burden victims with huge hospital bills and max out their insurance coverage. And a thief's medical history can be added to your own, leaving health-care providers confused about whom they're really treating.</p><p>""Imagine showing up at the ER in an ambulance and your <a href=""/health/electronic-medical-record-software"">medical records</a> say you have diabetes, but you don't,"" says Byron Hollis, managing director for the BlueCross and BlueShield Association's national antifraud department. ""If the <a href=""/health/the-top-doctors-in-america"">doctor</a> prescribes insulin based on false information, it could send you into insulin shock or a coma.""</p><p>So how does a thief get his hands on your information? It can be remarkably simple and low-tech: He picks up the wallet you lost and lifts the health insurance card inside, snags a benefits letter from your mailbox, or overhears you reciting your Social to the receptionist at your doctor's office.</p><p>In other cases, that same receptionist may be selling your identity for cash. In 2006, Isis Machado, then a desk clerk at the Cleveland Clinic in Weston, Florida, made off with more than 1,100 patient records and used them to file $2.8 million in bogus Medicare claims. </p><p>And though only 3 percent of all identity-theft cases involve medical records, experts worry that as electronic and online files become more common, criminals will have more opportunities to cash in. Ac­cording to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, since 2005 there have been more than 80 medical-data breaches, leaving millions of patients' records as exposed as if they'd been posted on MySpace.</p><p>Getting a medical ID theft resolved is more complicated than clearing up a typical identity swipe. With financial records, there's a credit bureau where all your information is stored; that's not the case with medical records. Victims must not only prove they didn't receive a treatment but also track down exactly which health-care providers have received the thief's health history so that false information doesn't result in a misdiagnosis or a denial of insurance claims.</p><p>""The biggest issue is that your health information travels to so many different places,"" says Susan Trost, a certified identity-theft risk management specialist and registered health information administrator. ""False information may have gone not only to your insurance company but also to pharmacies, emergency rooms, billing services, even research databases."" </p><p>Iron­ically, the best way to unravel all the communication is not to inform your doc of the problem--at least at first. That's because if you say you think your medical records might be mixed up with someone else's, your physician's office may refuse to show them to you for fear of violating the thief's privacy under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), says Heather Wells, director of recovery services at the identity-theft prevention company ID Experts. ""Once you say you're a victim of identity theft, it can be difficult to get access to your records,"" she says. ""The whole system shuts down.""</p><p>To avoid that, wait until after you've seen your medical records to spill to your doctor that you suspect identity theft. Then request an ""accounting of disclosures""--this document will show what other agencies your information has been shared with. Your doctor should inform all the medical professionals on the list that they have been given incorrect files, and you should call your pharmacy and do the same. (For more help, visit the World Privacy Forum at <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/medicalidentitytheft"">worldprivacyforum.org/medicalidentitytheft</a><br />.)</p><p>Your next step: Bring in the cops. Though the odds of catching your crook are next to nil--roughly 1 in 700 cases get solved--you'll need a copy of your police report to contest any fraudulent charges. You should also file a report with the Federal Trade Commission (go to <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.ftc.gov"">ftc.gov</a> and click on ""identity theft"") to help them spot and prosecute organized ID theft rings.</p><p>Finally, request a copy of your credit report--they're always free for victims of identity theft--and place a fraud alert on your file, which will notify you if anyone tries to create new accounts in your name. You can also put a security freeze on records to lock your credit info--this can give you extra piece of mind, but it can also make it tough for legitimate lenders to approve you for loans, and it won't keep thieves from using fraudu­lent accounts they've already opened.</p><p><b>A little privacy, please!</b></p><p>The time to start fighting medical id theft is before it happens. To help keep health-care leeches off your tail:</p><p><b>1. </b>Avoid giving out key information, like your SSN, date of birth, or mother's maiden name--and never provide them to anyone who calls you first. Most companies don't need this info, and many will accept substitutes.</p><p><b>2.</b> Never leave bills or letters that have your SSN, insurance numbers, or bank account numbers sitting in your mailbox or your trash. When in doubt, shred.</p><p><b>3. </b>Request a summary of benefits from your insurance company at least once a year, and monitor the statement closely. Look for anything suspicious, such as a mole you never had removed or prescriptions you never filled.</p><p><b>4.</b> Request a copy of your credit report from all three bureaus (Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian) at least twice a year. You can get one free copy each year; the other one you'll have to pay for.</p><p><b>5. </b>Guard your health insurance card like a credit card with a million-dollar limit--because ultimately, that's what it is. Bring your card along only when your doctor's office requests it; don't stash it in your wallet or in your car.</p>",relationships

What's more nerve-racking: skating in a competition or doing the samba in front of millions of people? </b><br />Dancing. I know exactly what I'm doing on the ice, and I'm in my element. But on the show, I was so nervous and wearing some weird, funky little outfit. It was crazy-I had no idea what I was in for. Dancing was mentally difficult; you had to remember all those steps in two days.</p><p><b>You've won six Olympic medals... so far. Do you like to date women who are equally ambitious about something?</b><br />Absolutely. It's important to be driven and have goals. You want an <a target=""_self"" href=""/life/boost-your-self-esteem"">independent woman</a> who knows what she wants and isn't afraid to go after it. It's attractive to me when a woman is doing what she loves. It makes me want to know more.</p><p><b>How can a girl tell if a guy is into her?</b><br />It's about sharing a look and making a connection. I can look into someone's eyes and feel like I know her better, versus a phone call, where you can't get that same type of emotion. That's why text messaging gets you in trouble: You can't bond, and emoticons explain only so much.</p><p><b>You follow a pretty strict diet. Can you date a hearty eater?</b><br />Oh yeah. I like getting to the point where you're really comfortable with each other, there are no barriers, and no one is trying to be polite with their eating habits. Just eat what you want-it's so primal! That said, if you're eating twice as much as I am, it leaves a question mark. It's like, ""Wow, are you an Olympic athlete too?""<br /><b><br />Should a woman make the first move?</b><br />It just depends on how she approaches you. Being way too forward is a red flag. It's like, ""Whoa, I don't know you yet.""

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/relationship-advice,Sex And Relationships,3,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,,When Less Romance Is More,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1211-less-more-art.jpg,"Photograph By <p>Spontaneous getaways and supersize bouquets settle squabbles in rom-coms and other fantasy realms, but in the real world, romantic gestures aren't cure-alls for <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/love-and-relationship-advice"">relationship problems</a>. In fact, unromantic gestures can be the better salve. Because couples are marrying later and living together before they do, continual improvement of the partnership is more important (and effective) than quick fixes, says Lisa Thomas, a licensed marriage therapist in Colorado. Nobody is suggesting romance be killed off completely-far from it. It's just smart to add these unconventional strengtheners into the happy-couple mix. </p><p><strong>Consider a Love Contract</strong><br /><strong>The Convention:</strong> Love should be spontaneous, not scripted.</p><p><strong>The Counter:</strong> ""If you negotiate difficult issues up front, your relationship will have a much stronger footing,"" says Paul Hokemeyer, Ph.D., a Manhattan-based marriage therapist. See: cohabitation agreements increasing 39 percent in the past five years, per the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, and couples creating DIY versions, using sites like 4relationshipcontract.com. Even the prince and princess of Silicon Valley, Mark Zuckerberg and his then-girlfriend (now wife) Priscilla Chan, reportedly made one.</p><p><strong>The Realistic Approach:</strong> When the two of you get serious, discuss how you each want the relationship to work, says Hokemeyer. ""Tell him, 'I want us both to be happy, so let's talk.'"" Hash out issues like sex, money, religion, and chores. Putting the plan into writing is key, but involving the law is optional.</p><p><strong>Spend Time Apart</strong><br /><strong>The Convention:</strong> The more minutes you spend together, the closer you'll be.</p><p><strong>The Counter:</strong> Maintaining independence actually solidifies couples. Experts say that constantly learning new things about each other is vital to keeping your relationship as riveting as your Twitter feed. ""You can't be glued at the hip to make that happen,"" says Thomas.</p><p><strong>The Realistic Approach:</strong> Take regular solo time. Natalie Magaña, 25, and her husband, of Chicago, do their own thing two or three nights a week. ""After being apart, I look forward to telling him about the shenanigans I had with my friends, and I can't wait to hear about his,"" she says.</p><p><strong>Schedule Sex</strong><br /><strong>The Convention:</strong> Penciling in intimacy is clinical.</p><p><strong>The Counter:</strong> ""It gives the message that, at that time, nothing is more important than being together,"" says Thomas. Plus, the more sex you have, the happier you'll be. Couples who gratify each other's sexual needs are 65 percent more likely to be satisfied in their pairing than those who don't, says a 2011 study in the <em>Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy</em>.</p><p><strong>The Realistic Approach:</strong> To up how often you undress each other, say ""I miss having sex with you,"" says Thomas, who advises mandated sack time once a week. If you aren't in the mood at that hour, cuddle or <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/kissing-tips"">kiss</a> instead.</p><p><strong>Welcome the Rough Patch</strong><br /><strong>The Convention:</strong> Focusing only on the positives helps couples through tough times.</p><p><strong>The Counter:</strong> In fragile unions, having some don't-want-the-neighbors-to-hear disagreements can help the relationship survive, per a study from the University of Tennessee. Doing so helps probe-and repair-what's wrong. ""You have to feel free to tell your partner something about them isn't fantastic,"" says Mary Vandergrift, 35, of Pittsburgh, who practices this with her husband.</p><p><strong>The Realistic Approach:</strong> Fight clean, advises Thomas. Remember to focus on finding a solution, not KO'ing your sparring partner. If you do get nasty, apologize for morphing into a mean girl and explain why you got upset.</p><p></p><p><strong>Don't Talk About Your Relationship with Others</strong><br /><strong>The Convention:</strong> Solid couples gush-and vent-about each other to their friends.</p><p><strong>The Counter:</strong> Blabbing too much can make your relationship feel like a reality show. When Sheila Dichoso, 29, of Los Angeles, started dating her now-fiancé, she told her friends everything, good and bad. But those spillfests can weaken his trust and put pressure on the couple's every move, says Thomas. Sheila soon resolved to keep mum about her relationship. ""Now it's like we have our own fun, private world,"" she says.</p><p><strong>The Realistic Approach:</strong> Pick one person to confide in, says Thomas. Sheila's is her older sister. ""She knows both of us, so when we have problems, she tells me when I'm the one who's being a jerk!"" she says. In which case, a small romantic gesture-see below-might be just the thing.</p><p><strong>5 Romantic Gestures to Embrace</strong></p><p><strong>Say ""I Love You""</strong><br />Those words ""give a true sense of security,"" says Lisa Thomas, a licensed marriage therapist in Colorado. Say them less out of habit, more when you're struck by how much you adore him.</p><p><strong>Surprise Each Other</strong><br />Romance ain't no big thing. Hide a handwritten note in his briefcase, download a sexy song on his iPod, or cook his favorite meal, says Thomas. And he should follow suit!</p><p><strong>Celebrate</strong><br />Revel in his achievements. A study at UCLA found that couples' actions during happy moments are more important than what they do during trying ones.</p><p><strong>Talk Dirty</strong><br />""'You look nice' is fine, but when my husband says 'Your boobs are awesome' or 'Your ass looks delicious,' it gives me a real lift,"" says Thomas.</p><p><strong>Have Rituals</strong><br />Whether it's Sunday-morning breakfast or a phone call on the way home, routines are crucial to a solid twosome, according to a 2010 report in Communications Studies.</p><p></p>","relationships,November 2012"

By fourth grade, she recalls, ""I was heavier than my friends and felt self-conscious changing for gym class."" Her eating habits worsened when she enrolled at Miami University in Ohio in 2007. ""My dorm was next to a 24-7 mini-mart, so I could <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/100-calories-quiz"">snack</a> all day or night,"" she says. During freshman year, she packed 25 pounds onto her 5'7"" frame. With summer looming, she vowed to bring her scale back from the brink of 200 pounds.<br /><br /><b>The Change</b><br />To avoid facing the music about her weight, Amy lived in oversize tees and sweats. But in January 2008, when she was turned away from a fraternity party with a harsh ""No fat girls allowed,"" she decided she needed to act. ""I was humiliated,"" she says. She committed to fixing her weight problem for good.<br /><br /><b>The Lifestyle</b><br />Amy meticulously measured <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-portion-control"">portions</a> and replaced cheese-laden snacks with oatmeal or hummus and carrots. Fast food became a rare indulgence, and she found low-cal options online before heading out to eat. She also started working out on the elliptical for 30 minutes five days a week. By the time she began her sophomore year at a new school, the University of Kentucky, she was down 25 pounds. There, Amy took up swimming, cycling, and running and lost 44 more pounds by her junior year. She proudly wore a size-4 swimsuit on a trip to Mexico that May.<br /><br /><b>The Reward</b><br />As Amy shed weight, her self-confidence grew. She became president of her sorority and had the guts to go for a postgrad internship at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in New Mexico, which she nabbed. ""I never would have applied before,"" she says. ""Now anything is within my grasp, as long as I'm willing to work for it.""<br /><br /><b>Amy's Tips:</b><br /><i>Plan to sweat.</i><br />""I write out a week's worth of workouts in my planner so I don't have to think about it-or back out-during the day.""<br /><br /><i>Fake your favorite desserts.</i><br />""I sprinkle cinnamon on sliced apples and pop them in the microwave for 30 seconds.

Smart, strong, and charming, Michelle Obama is a passionate advocate for improving health care and women's lives. She spoke candidly to us about her family's health habits and her top stress busters-plus we got the scoop on how, exactly, she got those <a href=""/fitness/michelle-obamas-workout"">enviably buff arms</a>. </i></p><p>You already know The West Wing.</p><p>It's home to the Oval Office, all the president's men and women, and a big dog pack of press people who bay and snarl at any whiff of news. A Marine serves as the door opener there; if you were to reach for the doorknob unbidden, it wouldn't be pretty. </p><p>The East Wing is quieter. That's where <a href=""/life/barack-obama"">First Lady Michelle Obama</a> spends most of her time, and it's where I met her for an exclusive interview on a recent afternoon. I arrived a day early, to check the place out. There wasn't much going on: Mrs. Obama had decamped to Monticello for the day with daughters Malia, 11, and Sasha, 8. </p><p>While I waited for an aide to meet me, I had free run of the wood-paneled lobby, which was decorated with scenes from the public and private lives of the resident family. Amidst glittery scenes from the inauguration and meetings with foreign leaders, there was one photo that caught my eye. </p><p>In it, Michelle Obama is wearing work gloves and helping to plant a large shrub, with assistance from a group of young school kids. Her husband, the most powerful man on earth, is in camera range, also wearing work gloves but for no apparent reason. He's flashing that famous broad grin, but doesn't look like he's ready to lift a pinky. Meanwhile, his wife is leveling him with one of those looks, familiar to many millions of married men. It says: <i>Are you going to just stand there, or are you gonna give me a hand?</i></p><p>The photographer's subsequent frame isn't shown, but I think we can all guess what happened next. </p><p></p><p><b>MICHELLE OBAMA</b> represents something new in the history of first ladies. She's better educated than some of the presidents who have resided in this house. Her professional career, you could argue, was more impressive than that of the man she married. And you'll remember that when <a href=""/life/barack-obama"">Barack Obama</a>-then a summer associate from Harvard Law-showed up for his first day of work at the offices of Sidley Austin in Chicago, it was his future wife who was assigned to show him the ropes. </p><p>Early on in the presidential campaign, her abundant smarts and no-nonsense speaking style occasionally got her into hot water; Americans just weren't used to a public woman who went toe-to-toe with the man who would be president. If Laura Bush was the embodiment of ""Stand By Your Man,"" Michelle Obama had more of a <i>Team of Rivals</i> air about her. She was a match for the man in her life, not just a support beam under him. </p><p>Add to this her role as First Mom to two adorable girls, and her possession of a pair of guns (in gym parlance) that could make the Secret Service want to double-check her registration, and you have an entirely updated feminine force emanating from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. </p><p>The aide who met me that day took me on a leisurely tour, culminating at the First Lady's empty office. There was a giant bowl of glossy red apples on a coffee table; I'd seen fresh fruit on desks throughout her executive suite. In a subsequent meeting with her husband, I noted the bowl's twin in the Oval Office. Cute. And smart. </p><p><b>THE NEXT DAY</b> Mrs. Obama returned to a full schedule. That's the way her staff plans it: wall-to-wall meetings and speeches when she's on duty two or three days a week, hours and hours with the girls when she's not. And her mother, Marian Robinson, is around to fill in. Sasha and Malia get only one shot at having a seminormal childhood, and the first parents seem determined not to blow it. The Obamas were doing the two-career-parent thing before the nation started paying attention, and they're applying the lessons they've learned now that the pressure is amped up. </p><p>For our interview, Mrs. Obama and I settled onto a historic couch in the Library, on the White House's ground floor. The room isn't far from the First Ladies' Garden, named in honor of Jacqueline Kennedy. There is a lovely rose bower there, but the current first lady has also planted vegetables on the grounds. After all, she's got work to do, reforming the way the nation's families eat. And she started on that quest in the best way: by reforming how she herself eats as a way to influence her daughters. </p><p>Here's what Mrs. Obama had to say about her roles, public and private, in what is arguably the most visible position held by any woman on the planet. She's not the president, but that means she's freer to speak her mind. Turns out she's got a lot to say. </p><p></p><p><i><b>Women's Health: Clearly health care is a complicated issue. What is your unique role in the debate?</b></i><br /><b>Michelle Obama:</b> I intend to advocate for the issues I care most about: access to primary care, [disease] prevention, wellness, nutrition, and combating childhood obesity. These issues get directly to the heart of the healthcare debate. Chronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and are an incredible drain on the system. </p><p>The American people remember the old adage that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Health insurance reform must make health care more than just sick care. [It] must improve the health of our nation by investing in critical prevention and wellness initiatives that help keep Americans healthy and out of the hospital in the first place. </p><p><i><b>WH: In your view, what are the most important steps in preventive <a href=""/life/health-insurance-costs"">health care</a>?</b></i><br /><b>MO: </b>We spend more money on health care than any other nation on earth, yet we are <a href=""/health/us-ranked-worst-in-preventable-deaths"">nowhere near the healthiest</a>. In fact, people in some of the countries that spend less than we do are actually living longer than we do. And today, chronic and preventable illnesses like diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and high blood pressure consume 85 percent of all healthcare spending. </p><p>And if you think that's bad, just wait a few years. Because right now, nearly a third of all children in this country are overweight or obese, and a third will suffer from diabetes at some point in their lifetimes. In the African American and Hispanic communities, that number goes up to half. </p><p>We have an individual responsibility to look after ourselves and our families by making better choices when it comes to what we eat and making exercise a regular part of our lifestyle. We need to educate children in particular about how to live a healthy lifestyle. If we provide kids with [that] foundation, they are much more likely to become healthy adults. </p><p><i><b>WH: Was health an issue in your family when you were growing up?</b></i><br /><b>MO:</b> Not general health. My father had multiple sclerosis, so I never took health for granted, because I saw a father that at the prime of his life was struck with an illness that completely changed his life. </p><p><i><b>WH: When was your dad diagnosed?</b></i><br /><b>MO:</b> [I was] very young. I don't remember him ever being able to walk without a cane. So my brother and I never took for granted the ability to run and play sports, because my father was an athlete before. So he put that energy into my brother and me. </p><p>Our general health was never an issue because back then, families were sort of forced into a regimen that was more healthy. We couldn't afford to go out to dinner, so [it] was a rare treat. We would have a theater class on Saturdays, and [afterward] if Dad turned left we were going to McDonald's, and if he turned right we were going home, and we'd always go, ""Go left, Dad! Go left!"" The few times he went left, it was like Christmas! And we got pizza on report card day. That was a reward, pizza. Dessert was given sparingly. We would get ice cream, three little pints, and we would eat out of those for days. You'd get little scoops: Here, you get a little chocolate, you get a little butter pecan, and that would be it. Those values-even though they were the result of economic circumstances-were really good, and they created some pretty healthy boundaries about food. </p><p></p><p><i><b>WH: There's also a family dynamic that was important there, too.</b></i><br /><b>MO:</b> Absolutely. That's been a huge plus to living in the White House. Dad's office is just downstairs, and it's rare that we don't have dinner together. No matter what's going on, he sets aside that time. Dinner time is at 6:30 p. m., and he comes in, we sit down. I think this week was an odd week because we ate dinner together the other night, and he said, ""Wow, we haven't done this in a couple of days."" We say our thanks, our prayer-we usually take turns. We sort of do a blessing, say a grace, and then, you know, we have the tradition of just going around and talking about our days, the good and the bad aspects. </p><p><i><b>WH: And you've got Grandma at the dinner table as well, right?</b></i><br /><b>MO: </b>Grandma doesn't eat with us all the time because she wants to give us, the nuclear family, a chance to bond. She says that she thinks it's important for Mom, Dad, and the kids to sit down and have that space. This is her belief; we don't believe it. We're like, ""Grandma, when you want to eat, eat."" She's like, ""Let me not get in your way. I like my life over here"" [<i>laughs</i>]. </p><p><i><b>WH: Who would you say is the biggest health nag in the family?</b></i><br /><b>MO: </b>You know, I don't know [that] either of us is a nag. I'm the mom, so I monitor-I am with the kids every single meal. But Dad is no slouch, either. He doesn't believe that the kids should have dessert every single night; that should be a weekend treat. Although, you know, there's the exception if there's a birthday party, if they go to a friend's house. What we try to do in our household is to make the primary source of their food mostly healthy and balanced, so that they don't have to worry when they go to a birthday party or when they're at a sleepover. They're not hoarding junk food because they don't get it at all. We want to make sure that the balance of their diet is pretty thoughtful. </p><p>My kids are now much more conscientious. There are some fast-food places they refuse to go to because they've learned about how food is prepared. One of my children won't eat at certain places, which before we got here was a real hassle. You were running around, you've got five minutes for lunch, and you want to go through a drive-thru. And you've got someone in the back going, ""Oh, no, we can't eat <i>there</i>."" </p><p><i><b>WH: Experts say we're sleep-deprived and stressed and that it's taking a big health toll. How many hours of sleep do you typically get? Any stress busters you'd like to share?</b></i><br /><b>MO:</b> I am a big believer in sleep. I go to bed early, shortly after I put the girls to bed, so that I am rested the next day. For me, getting enough sleep, eating right, and exercising reduce my stress levels. And a really good workout is a great stress buster. </p><p><i><b>WH: Your mom raised you to be an achiever. How was that drive instilled when you were a young girl, and how are you instilling it in your own daughters?</b></i><br /><b>MO: </b>I had parents who helped me understand early on that hard work, discipline, and the choices I made in life were really the only things that defined me. So I always worked really hard. I focused in school. I did my best. Getting good grades was always important to me, and it wasn't because my parents were hounding me or that they had the expectation. It was something that I wanted for myself. I wanted an A. I wanted to be smart. I wanted to be the person who had the right answer. I lived in a community where being smart wasn't necessarily the cool thing to be. </p><p>[My brother and I] learned to make decisions that allowed us to keep as many options open as possible. And those were choices you made-whether I got up and went to school on time. My mother said, ""That's your choice. Don't do it for me, do it for yourself."" I heard that in my head every single day: 'I'm doing this for me.' I ran into people who doubted me, who didn't think I could do certain things. I viewed that as a challenge, and that never stopped me. That always made me push harder. Barack and I want to instill that same work ethic and focus in our daughters so they, too, can achieve anything they want to. </p><p><i><b>WH: Are your girls involved in the White House garden?</b></i><br /><b>MO: </b>They're probably as interested as the average kids would be interested in anything that their parents are doing. It's their backyard and it's like<i>...eh...eh</i>...you know? [<i>laughs</i>] But they do love to be involved in preparing the food, and when they have time they work with the chefs to prepare a meal. </p><p></p><p><i><b>WH: Your husband is something of a BlackBerry addict. Do you set technology limits for your kids in the White House?</b></i><br /><b>MO:</b> Oh, yes, we do. During the school year, no TV, no computers during the school week. Only on weekends. Over the summer they have a limit of two hours of TV or computer time, and they can break that up. Setting limits is good, not just for their health but for their intellectual curiosity too, because if they can't hop on the computer or the TV, they're going to read a book, take a swim, or spend some time running around with a friend. </p><p><i><b>WH: You and the president are fitness devotees. You also both enjoy a Ray's Hell Burger from time to time. What's the perfect balance between restraint and indulgence?</b></i><br /><b>MO:</b> I do love a good burger and fries. French fries are my favorite food in the whole world. If I could, I'd eat them at every meal-but I can't. My whole thing is moderation. If I make good, healthy choices most of the time, then having what I love every once in a while won't hurt. I have to exercise and eat in a balanced way. If I start ignoring both, I will put on weight. I am fortunate in that I'm five-eleven, so it takes a while for the weight to be seen, but it'll come! It's just distributed more. If I didn't exercise and eat right I would be heavier, and I have been. </p><p><i><b><br />WH: What are your favorite meals to request from the White House kitchen?</b></i><br /><b>MO: </b>The cooks here are excellent. [They haven't] made anything I don't like. They make some mean waffles and grits in the morning, but I don't eat waffles every day. They make some soups and light, healthy salads for lunch. They make soups that taste creamy without being cream-based, because that's something we work on- how do we keep the calories down but On the elevator after an event, one last buffet goody in hand keep the flavors up? They buy lots of seasonal local fresh fruits and vegetables. And I love their sweet potato fries! </p><p><i><b>WH: You look like you're having fun with this whole ""fashion icon"" thing. Where does your sense of style come from? </b></i><br /><b>MO:</b> For me fashion is fun, and it's supposed to help you feel good about yourself. I think that's what all women should focus on: what makes them happy and feel comfortable and beautiful. I wear what I love. Sometimes people like it, sometimes they don't. I'm fine with that. </p><p><b><a href=""/fitness/michelle-obamas-workout"">Get Michelle's fitness secrets</a><br /></b></p>",What To Wear
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/schedule,Life,0,5,0,1,1,1,1,0,,Schedule Your Life: The Best Time of Day to Schedule Anything,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0711-clock-it-1964.jpg,"Like a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/abusive-bosses"">high-maintenance boss</a>, your body has its moods. It can be sluggish or wired, chill or wigged out, in the zone or totally out of it. When it comes to cramming as much as possible into your insanely busy day, you can use those ups and downs (caused by cyclical changes in hormone levels, body temperature, even <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/boost-your-metabolism"">metabolism</a>) to your advantage. Biological rhythms play a major role in everything from how good we feel during a workout to how well we tolerate booze and respond to mental challenges, according to Jennifer Ackerman, author of <i>Sex Sleep Eat Drink Dream: A Day in the Life of Your Body.</i><br /><br />But reading your internal rhythms is only one piece of the puzzle -- for smooth sailing throughout the day, you've also got to figure in traffic patterns, waiting-room crowds, and employee shift changes. If a little voice inside your head is whispering ""Not worth the trouble,"" relax. Just sync up your schedule with our guide, and <i>pow!</i> Suddenly your day's running like a Swiss watch.<br /><br /><b>8:15 a.m. Lose the stubble</b><br /><br />Shaving your legs during your morning shower isn't just convenient. This is the time when your platelets -- which help blood clot when you nick yourself -- are becoming much more active, meaning you're less likely to need a Band-Aid if you do get a cut, says Matthew Edlund, M.D., head of the Center for Circadian Medicine in Sarasota, Florida, and author of <i>The Body Clock Advantage</i>. But skip the razor if you're getting a pedicure later. Shaving can remove a layer of skin cells, so exfoliants will sting, and any little nick is an open door for bacteria, says Marlene Reid, D.P.M., spokesperson for the American Podiatric Medical Association. <br /><br /><b>9 a.m. Go under the knife</b><br /><br />Last year, a Duke University Medical Center research team analyzed more than 90,000 surgeries and found that patients undergoing afternoon operations were more likely to have problems related to anesthesia -- including post-op pain and queasiness -- than those in the morning rotation. Experts theorize that fatigue and shift changes may take a toll on the teams of doctors and nurses who put you under. A.M. slots can also mean a fresh attending physician and fewer administrative delays, such as backups in the lab for test results. Plus, you won't have to starve for the entire day if you're supposed to fast before your procedure. <br /><br /><b>10:00 a.m. Get your money back</b><br /><br />Went on a wild shopping spree with your last paycheck? Show up at the mall in the morning to take some of it back, and you'll be out in minutes. ""Hit the store right when it opens. Even on weekends, that's when lines tend to be shortest,"" says shopping expert Kathryn Finney, creator of thebudgetfashionista.com. You're also less likely to get a cashier who doesn't know her store credits from her price look-ups, since more experienced workers often score daytime shifts, while rookies end up working through dinner. <br /><br /><b>10:30 a.m. Command the conference room</b><br /><br />To make a solid impression, fire up the PowerPoint when your brain is most alert -- 2 to 3 hours after you wake up, says Michael Thorpy, M.D., director of the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. By midmorning, your body temperature has risen (it dips during sleep), so you can run on all cylinders -- neurons fire faster when your body is warmed up. The timing also suits your audience. ""It's not so early that people are nodding off, but it's before stomachs start rumbling for lunch,"" explains communication expert Ronnie Moore, author of <i>Why Did I Say That? Communicating to Keep Your Credibility, Your Cool, and Your Cash!</i> <br /><br /><b>12 p.m. Strike a tree pose</b><br /><br />By midday, your warmed-up body is more supple and yielding, allowing you to get into poses smoothly, says Connie Chan, founder of Levitate Yoga in New York City. Plus, studios are the least crowded at noon, since the usual lunch break won't cover a 90-minute class. Read: no unwanted warriors in your mat space, plus more individual attention, says Jaya Schillinger, president of Inspiration, Inc., a consulting company that works with holistic businesses. Just show up to work early and use the extra time at lunch to perfect your crow pose. <br /><br /><b>1:00 p.m. Open wide</b><br /><br />What's the best way to keep your next dental visit from becoming your personal <i>Little Shop of Horrors?</i> Schedule it for the afternoon. Even if you brush and floss after breakfast, plaque that builds up during the day offers a temporary protective coating for the areas around the gum line, where your teeth are the most sensitive, says Carolyn Taggart-Burns, D.D.S., a spokesperson for the Academy of General Dentistry. Plus, your gag reflex will be less active after lunch, when you've got a full stomach. <br /><br /><b>2:30 p.m. Get a cut that rates</b><br /><br />Weekday afternoons are slow for most hair salons -- it's also a time when they're blissfully free of shrieking bridezilla posses. So if you can sneak away from the office for an hour, ""you'll get faster, more attentive service,"" says Jeanell Allan, an educator for the Naperville, Illinois, branch of Mario Tricoci Hair Salons and Day Spas. Bonus: Since your mane's been weathering the workday, the stylist can accurately evaluate how limp, poufy, or cowlicky it is in its natural state, says Tiffany Ford, owner of Cleveland's SalonBlu. ""It helps us figure out the best way to cut and treat it,"" she says. The downside: That also means no washing, blow-drying, curling, or flat-ironing your locks the morning of your appointment. <br /><br /><b>4:00 p.m. Book a training session</b><br /><br />A 2005 review published in <i>Chronobiology International</i> revealed that people are stronger and less injury-prone between 4 p.m. and nightfall than they are earlier in the day. It's also when you'll get better access to machines -- and trainers. Before work, after work, and lunchtime are when the masses hit the treadmills. But swing by in the late afternoon, and ""you have the best shot at snagging a popular trainer who'd be booked solid during prime hours,"" explains Lindsay Dunlap, a trainer at the Sports Club/LA in New York City. If you take your lunch break later in the day, you'll avoid the sweaty throng. <br /><br /><b>5:00 p.m. Knock one back</b><br /><br />Got happy hour plans? The earlier in the evening you gulp down that pint of Bass, the less likely it is to leave you tipsy. The science: Your liver detoxifies the body more efficiently in the early evening, when an increase in body temperature (which rises throughout the day and then bottoms out while we're asleep) boosts metabolism, and that helps you break down the booze, Dr. Edlund says. But as the evening wears on and your body grows tired, alcohol's alertness-dulling effects start to multiply. So shut down your computer and go grab a brewski. <br /><br /><b>6:00 p.m. Let 'em down easy</b><br /><br />Unless it's urgent, save a bad-news bombshell for after work. Drop it right before a meeting, and you'll just max out the recipient's stress level. An early-evening delivery gives them time to process what they've heard. ""You can't control the information, but you can control how they get it,"" says Anthony Back, M.D., a Seattle oncologist and creator of Oncotalk, a training program funded by the National Cancer Institute that teaches young doctors how to break bad news to patients. <br /><br /><b>7:00 p.m. Replace your running shoes</b><br /><br />Feet expand a half-size or more when you exercise, says Paul Langer, D.P.M., author of <i>Great Feet for Life</i>. Which means the kicks that fit you pre-run might be squeezing your toes at the finish line. Shop for running shoes right after an evening workout and you'll be more likely to find a pair that fits. <br /><br /><b>A plan for all seasons</b><br /><br />Now that you've got your 24 figured out, here are the best days and months to get bigger stuff done<br /><br /><b>Get a refill: Midmonth</b><br />At the pharmacy, the longest lines form at the beginning of the month. That's when welfare and Social Security checks arrive -- and when insurance companies adjust coverage, meaning pharmacists have to spend time explaining why a co-pay has changed, says Jennifer Athay, Pharm.D., a staff pharmacist at the American Pharmacists Association. And that extra traffic can lead to frazzled workers who are more likely to make mistakes. A 2005 study found that, partly due to those additional errors, medication-related fatalities are 25 percent more likely to occur at the beginning of the month.<br /><br /><b>Upgrade your wheels: September</b><br />This time of year, dealers are moving next year's models onto the lot, so they slash prices on current-year rides to clear them out, says Philip Reed, consumer advice editor at edmunds.com. Also look for deals at the end of any month, when salespeople are more likely to cut you a break as they strive to reach bonus quotas.<br /><br /><b>Get that thing lasered off : October or November</b><br />Let your summer tan fade before scheduling hair removal, vein removal, or other skin treatments, says dermatologist Coyle Connolly, D.O., founder of Connolly Skin Care in New Jersey. Tanned skin tends to absorb the laser's heat energy, increasing your odds of developing a condition called hyperpigmentation -- darkened spots that can last weeks or even months. The fall is also a great time to have your dermatologist examine you for moles, which stand out more when skin is lighter.<br />",You and Improved

But with a little planning, you can harness hormonal ups and downs to your advantage. Witchcraft? No, Science! During certain stages of your cycle, researchers have found that we have an especially easy time communicating, canoodling, even burning calories. Based on the average 28-day cycle (everyones a little different), heres how to surf the crimson tide instead of cursing it.<br /><br /><b>Days 1 to 10 - It All Starts Here</b><br /><br />In your mind, the start of your period probably signals the end of the month, but from now on, label it the start of your cycle. In the first few days of bleeding, estrogen and progesterone levels hit rock bottom. Nows the perfect time to:<br /><br /><b>Grab the Wheel</b><br />Scientists don't know exactly why, but lower estrogen levels give women an edge in what researchers call male cognitive skills, such as spatial thinking. We thought said researchers were just sexist jerks until we saw the slew of studies proving that guys really are superior at rotating three-dimensional objects in their heads and keeping track of north and south. But during this 10-day window, were better than usual at both -- which means you'll have no trouble cramming a ton of camping gear into a tiny trunk or figuring out how to get back on the highway after that wrong turn in Poughkeepsie.</p><p></p><b>Cease Fire</b><br />Ready to stop spending $1,500 a year on your pack-a-day habit? Nows the best time to <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/one-way-to-quit-smoking"">quit smoking</a>, says Louann Brizendine,M.D., author of <i>The Female Brain</i>. Nicotine cravings are typically strongest in the first 2 weeks after quitting, but going smoke free early on in your cycle will make them easier to manage, since withdrawal symptoms are weaker when progesterone levels are low, according to a recent review of studies from the Medical University of South Carolina.<br /><br /><b>Days 11 to 14: The Drop Zone</b><br /><br />At midcycle, estrogen levels soar, causing a surge in LH, a hormone that signals your ovaries to roll out your little chromosome bomb of an egg. The exact day its released is different for everyone, but ovulation typically falls around day 14, says Mary Abusief, M.D., aclinical fellow in reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston. Given that you're brimming with estrogen, nows a good time to:<br /><br /><b>Don a Paper Minidress</b><br />Smear, speculum, swab -- feeling squeamish yet? Women often complain about the discomfort of Pap tests, in which a tiny brush pulls a few cells out of the cervix, says Toni Weschler, M.P.H., a womens health educator and the author of <i>Taking Charge of Your Fertility</i>. Yeeeesh. But in the days before ovulation, your cervix softens and opens up to let cervical fluid out -- and sperm in, if thats what you're after. Schedule a ride in the stirrups now and you stand to avoid a lot of pinching.<br /><br /><b>Command the Conference Room</b><br />You can probably argue circles around your boyfriend any night of the week, but on these days you could moderate an O'Donnell/Trump smackdown. A flood of estrogen boosts your brains ability to nail word-related tasks, says Pauline Maki, Ph.D., associate professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Several studies, including one that Maki led for the National Institute on Aging, have found that women are more verbally agile and can access their vocabularies faster at midcycle than at other times of the month. Translation: time to give a presentation, go for a job interview, or finally settle that long-standing Beatles vs. Stones debate.<br /><br /><b>Go for the O</b><br />Right now you may be hornier than Hugh Hefner at a twin convention, so take advantage. A 2004 University of Chicago study proposed renaming this part of the cycle the sexual phase, because participants had stronger sexual desire, increased fantasies, and more randy activity while ovulating. And a 2005 study from Milan noted that during this phase, women had higher blood levels of oxytocin, a brain chemical that increases during orgasm.<br /><br /><b>Days 15 to 28: The Fade-Out</b><br /><br />After ovulation, you have about 2 weeks until Big Red strikes again. In this phase, the ovaries secrete less estrogen and more progesterone, a hormone that helps maintain the lining of the uterus on the off chance your waiting egg is fertilized. If the miracle of life goes untapped, another menstrual cycle ensues, which means you should brace yourself for PMS.

And the more stress, the less chance of falling into slumber. An ancient <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.iyogalife.com/Kundalini/"">Kundalini</a> yoga relaxation technique can give your mind something else to focus on and, in turn, help you <a href=""/health/destress-instantly"">relax</a>. </p><p>Nancy Elkes, an instructor at Practice <a href=""/yoga/poses"">Yoga</a> in Manhattan, recommends using the Meditation on the White Swan (also called Hunsani meditation) to quiet the mind in order to fall asleep. The more you use it before bed, the more accustomed your body becomes to this process of physically settling down. Once it's part of your routine, it can soothe your entire body to fall asleep faster.</p><p>Meditation on the White Swan</p><p>1. Sit in a comfortable seat with a straight spine. Fold your fingers into your palms with the thumbs extended. Press your thumb tips together until they turn white (no need to press hard, just firmly). The tips are facing down in a V-shape to keep the joint relaxed.</p><p>2. Place your hands 6 to 8 inches in front of the brow point, with the backs of the hands facing you. Fix your eyes on the white of your thumb tips and get a clear mental image of your thumbs.</p><p>3. Then close your eyes and clearly ""see"" the thumb tips through the eyelids mentally.</p><p>4. Let the mind meditate on the sound ""Sat"" (Sanskrit for ""truth"") as you inhale, and think ""Nam"" (meaning ""the expression of your truth"") as you exhale. Let the mental sound vibrate in your body and continue for 5-11 minutes.</p><p>5. Give yourself over to the sleep gods as you let go. ""You will reach a state of complete relaxation when you surrender all the mind's busy thoughts and all of the body's tensions over to someone or something else,"" Elkes says. ""Even if you have to envision your thoughts and aches or tension being swallowed up in the waves, let them flow away from you.""</p><p>6. To finish, touch the tongue to the roof of the mouth, gently swallow, softly float your eyes open and lay down for a deep sleep.</p><p>You can also try this lying down. You might find that soon after envisioning your thumbs,your alarm is waking you up.</p><p>More from <i>WH</i>:<br /><a href=""/health/de-stress-for-better-sleep?page=1"">Sleep Right, Starting Tonight</a><br /><a href=""/health/sleep-deprivation"">The Cost of Lost Shuteye</a><br /><a href=""/health/sleep-aids"">Best Sleep Aids</a></p><p><a href=""/health/sleep-better-0""></a></p><a href=""/health/sleep-better-0""></a><p></p>","You and Improved,Be In The Know"

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/natalie-coughlin,Fitness,2,4,0,0,0,191,0,0,,Swimmer Natalie Coughlin,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1207-natalie-coughlin.jpg,"Photograph By <p><strong>Fitness feat:</strong><br />She has won a medal in every Olympic race she's entered (that's 12--and counting).</p><p><strong>What winners know:</strong><br />""As I get older, I know I can't keep the same intensity I had when I was 18, or I'll risk more overuse injuries. But I trust my strength and endurance and know it's there. So I swim less, but when I get into the water, my time is more focused. I choose what I do more carefully to make every exercise and training session count.""</p><p><strong>Steal this skill:</strong><br />Pilates roll-up. ""We often get these stiff places along our spine that could cause chronic tightness, so doing this not only helps you get stronger but also helps prevent a lot of tension."" Lie on the floor with your legs straight and pressed together, toes pointed. Pull your belly in, drop your shoulders away from your ears, and extend your arms straight back, fingers pointing behind you. Slowly curl your torso up, bringing your arms over your head, dropping your chin, and lifting your shoulder blades off the floor. Roll up vertebra by vertebra, until your fingers reach toward your toes, keeping your legs on the floor. Lower your torso back to the starting position, one vertebra at a time.</p><p><strong>See the Bright Side</strong><br />Find the silver lining of setbacks and use it to surpass your goals.</p><p>Coughlin made quite a splash at the 2008 Olympics: She became the first American woman to win six medals at one Olympics and the first woman ever to win back-to-back Olympic gold in the 100-meter backstroke. Shortly after Beijing, though, the 29-year-old underwent double shoulder surgery to repair overuse injuries, which kept her out of the pool for six weeks (though she voluntarily stayed out for 18 months). ""My body completely changed,"" she says. ""I lost all of my upper-body strength; my arms totally shrank."" Talk about a long drop from the top.</p><p>Thing is, Coughlin didn't see it that way: Rather than dwelling on the setback, she focused on what she could do. She ran six to seven miles a day (often up hills) to keep her legs strong, and she took up Pilates. Turns out, what started as rehab to safely rebuild and balance out her body also happened to improve her swimming. ""Pilates connects your arms to your legs through your core and teaches you how to apply your strength in the most efficient way,"" says Coughlin. ""In swimming, the idea is to do that while going as fast you can."" That's why Pilates is now a mainstay in her routine: She takes group classes twice a week, sees a private instructor once a week, and does her own mat routine as a warm-up before getting into the pool.</p><p>You're going to experience setbacks--whether it's due to injury, bad weather, or just a hectic schedule. Liukin agrees and says the key is staying positive, so you can still maintain your forward trajectory toward your goals. ""My dad [Valeri Liukin, an Olympic gold-medal-winning gymnast] says instead of saying 'I can't,' say 'Maybe not today, but I can tomorrow,'"" says Liukin.</p><p>When even that's not enough, she listens to the advice her mom, former World Champion rhythmic gymnast Anna Kotchneva, gave her: No crucial decisions should be made on bad days. ""There were tons of times I wanted to quit, and she told me to wait until I had a good day before deciding,"" says Liukin. ""If you have a good day, there's more on the table and you can make a more balanced decision.""

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/yoga/key-poses-for-improvement,Yoga,10,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,,Three Essential Yoga Poses,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/yoga-break-through.jpg,"<p>Think kicking up into a <a href=""/yoga/handstand-pose"">handstand</a> looks really easy? It isn't. We don't want to discourage you, but if you haven't been practicing regularly for some time, odds are you won't be hanging around upside down by next week. But you can start doing the things that will lead to doing <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/handstand-pose""><b>handstand (urdhva vrksasana)</b></a>-and all other über-poses-laying the groundwork by mastering a few fundamental yoga moves. ""Each pose will teach you something about the next,"" says Seane Corn, a renowned yoga instructor at Sacred Movement in Santa Monica, California. ""If you really understand the dynamics of <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/downward-facing-dog-pose""><b>down dog</b></a>, for example, those actions begin to translate into the next level."" Even better, you don't have to nail handstand to start getting the increased flexibility and strength, reduced aches and pains, and the delicious sense of peace that yoga offers-that all starts right now.</p><p><b>1. Beginner's breakthrough pose:</b> <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/tree-pose""><b>TREE(vrksasana)</b></a><b></b><br />Patience brings balance in this beginner pose</p><p><b>Why:</b> Yoga begins with <a href=""/fitness/stability-ball-circles"">stability</a> and balance, and no pose teaches them better than the one-legged balance, <b>tree</b>. Patience, please: Give yourself a break if it takes you some time to feel stable and grounded. After all trees can take hundreds of years to become strong and rooted.</p><p><b>How:</b> Stand tall with your feet hip-distance apart and your arms at your sides. Shift your weight onto your left foot. Fix your gaze on a spot on the wall in front of you to help your balance. Then bend your right knee and, reaching down, use your right hand to place your right foot on the inside of your left thigh, just above your knee. Open your right knee out to the side. Anchor yourself to the floor with your left foot, your roots, and visualize your torso as the stable trunk. Make sure your pelvis is facing forward. Then bring your hands together in front of your chest. Stay here for a full minute, or as long as you can. Slowly lower your arms and come back to standing. Repeat on the other side. Then do the pose on the first side again. This time, bring your arms overhead with hands separated shoulder-width apart and palms facing one another. Visualize your arms as a tree's branches, strong and steady. Repeat the pose (with the arms overhead) on the other side. </p><p><b>Tips:</b> To keep from toppling over like so many new students do, instructor Seane Corn suggests two things: First, try the pose either leaning your back against a wall or touching a wall with your hand to steady yourself. Second, coax tight hips open by pressing the bone under your big toe on your standing foot firmly into the floor. </p><p><b>Insight:</b> Tight hips are often to blame for knocking you off-kilter in this posture. Practicing it helps you develop external rotation in the hips, which you'll use over and over again. And since the pose ""teaches you how to open up the hip without being weight-bearing, there is less pressure on the joints and the lower back,"" Corn says. ""As you get more flexibility in the hip, you can gradually begin to bring the right foot up higher on your thigh.""</p><p><b>2. Intermediate breakthrough pose: </b><a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/downward-facing-dog-pose""><b>DOWNWARD-FACING DOG(adho mukha svanasana)</b></a></p><p><b>Why: Downward-facing dog</b> is one of the most frequently used postures-it often links others together in a flow, or <i>vinyasa</i>, class. But just because it's common doesn't mean it's simple. ""Down Dog encompasses a lot of different body parts; it strengthens the arms and helps with shoulder, back, and hamstring flexibility,"" Corn says. Done correctly, down dog also gives intermediate students the benefit of an inversion (a pose where hips are higher than the heart) before moving on to more challenging poses like <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/headstand-pose""><b>headstand (sirsasana)</b></a>, <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/handstand-pose""><b>handstand (urdhva vrksasana)</b></a>, or <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/forearm-balance-pose""><b>forearm balance (pincha mayurasana)</b></a>. And because it's used so often, it's extra important to get it right. </p><p><b>How:</b> Start on all fours with your wrists slightly in front of your shoulders. Separate your knees hip-width apart and curl your toes under. Push into your palms and lift your knees. Lift your sitting bones and push the tops of your thighs back so that your body looks like an inverted ""V."" At first, keep your knees bent and heels lifted. Then slowly start to straighten your knees, without locking them. Gently begin to move your chest back toward your thighs until your ears are even with your upper arms; don't let your head dangle. Keep your hips lifting and push strongly into your hands. Lengthen your spine, spread your fingers apart, and breathe for 10 deep breaths. </p><p>To come out of the pose, lower your knees to the floor, coming onto all fours, and then rest your butt on your heels in <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/childs-pose""><b>child's pose (balasana)</b></a>.Practice <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/downward-facing-dog-pose""><b>down dog</b></a> five times, increasing the number of breaths each time.</p><p><b>Tip:</b> One common eager-beaver mistake here is to stick your chest too close to the floor and your butt to the ceiling in an attempt to nail the pose, which just overarches the back. To avoid this risky mistake, focus on moving your tailbone toward the floor. </p><p><b>Insight:</b> Heels don't reach the floor? Don't sweat it. In fact, it's probably better for people with tight hamstrings not to aim for that ideal. ""For them it's better to have their knees slightly bent-or the pose puts too much strain on the wrists,"" Corn says.</p><p><b>3. Advanced breakthrough pose: </b><a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/handstand-pose""><b>HANDSTAND(urdhva vrksasana)</b></a></p><p><b>Why:</b> Turning completely upside down in an inversion brings the advanced student to new levels of concentration, balance, courage, and focus-while also taking pressure off the heart and allowing blood to flow straight to the brain. Handstand also strengthens arms, wrists, and shoulders. Nailing it for the first time leaves most yogis psyched and coming back for more.</p><p><b>How:</b> Facing a wall, come into <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/downward-facing-dog-pose""><b>downward-facing dog</b></a>, with your middle fingers about 4 inches away from it and hands shoulder-width apart. As you press strongly into your palms, firm your shoulder blades against your back, rotate your upper arms out, and get ready to fly. Start by practicing a few hops: Bend and slightly step one foot forward and hop as you kick the opposite leg up toward the wall. Do this a few times, hopping a bit higher each time. Think about bringing your hips directly over your shoulders. When you feel ready to be airborne, take a great big hop and kick the opposite leg up high so the heel swings forward to touch the wall and the other leg follows. Once you are balancing against the wall upside down with both heels touching the wall, straighten your legs, reach out through the balls of your feet, engage your abdominals, and breathe. Your head should hang between your shoulder blades with your gaze resting toward the center of the room. Lengthen the sides of your body, and roll your thighs toward each other. Stay here for 10 seconds-that's enough. To come down, slowly lower one leg and then the other until you are hanging in a forward bend. Stay here for a few breaths and relax. </p><p><b>Tips:</b> Practice your pre-handstand hops every time you do yoga. Eventually you will build the strength and confidence to go all the way. When you do, work your way up to staying inverted for a minute or more. </p><p><b>Insight:</b> An effortless <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/handstand-pose""><b>handstand</b></a> is a beautiful thing. But a poorly executed <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/handstand-pose""><b>handstand</b></a> can wreak havoc on your shoulders and wrists. A common problem is not pushing down on the hands enough. Once you get up, look down and make sure the bone on the bottom of your index finger presses down into the floor. ""If you cup the hands instead, you wind up taking the weight to the outside of the wrists,"" Corn says. This anchoring action also helps the shoulders and back: ""If you aren't pushing into the floor with your hands, then the shoulders aren't rolling open. Odds are you'll arch your back and look like a banana."" Not a good look, we're sure you'll agree.</p>",

And the best way to know if you're winning is to track your progress. Sounds great, except it's hard enough to remember to pack a sports bra, much less recall how much weight you hoisted last Tuesday. That's why you've gotta write it down. Every detail you put on paper will let you know when to scale back and when to jack it up a notch. Even better, you'll know you're getting fitter. We talked to fitness gurus to find out the five most important things you should record after every workout. Any pad will do (our pick: the very cute Hable Construction spiral-top notebook, $16, seejanework.com). Tackle all your goals just by jotting down a few notes? We'll ink that deal. </p><p><b><br />Log this: Date, Day, Time, Location, </b><b>and whatever strength moves or cardio you do that day</b><br /><b><br />To figure out: </b>Your ideal workout conditions <br /><b><br />How to use the intel:</b> At the end of every week, place a star by the days you were especially productive and an ""X"" by the ones when you felt like hell. After a month, note the trends and adjust your schedule accordingly. ""Maybe you'll notice that you can lift more weight first thing in the morning and push yourself harder on the track after work,"" says Kelli Calabrese, M.S., C.S.C.S., a trainer in Flower Mound, Texas. (Yes, that's the name of her town. We asked--twice.) </p><p><b><br />Log this Reps, sets, and weights</b><br /><b><br />To figure out: </b>How to tweak your strength workout to achieve max results <br /><b><br />How to use the intel:</b> To keep improving strength and tone, you need to up the number of sets, reps, or weight each time you do a particular workout. Whichever you choose, increase that same factor across the board, like this: If last week you did one set each of 8, 10, and 12 reps per exercise, today aim for 10, 12, and 15 reps. This might sound like a big fat <i>duh,</i> but when you're doing 10 different exercises in a workout, it's hard to remember info like this, says Pamela Peeke, M.D., M.P.H., author of Fit to Live. ""It takes the thinking out of it and helps you set goals, so every workout you're challenging yourself a little more,"" Calabrese says. </p><p><b><br />Log this Intensity</b><br /><b><br />To figure out: </b>Whether you're doing your best <br /><b><br />How to use the intel: </b>After each set of a strength exercise, note your Perceived Exertion (PE)--how hard you worked on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 feels like you could do a hundred more reps, and at 10 you're shaking to eke out the last rep). After a cardio workout, write down your max PE (1=You can chat easily; 10=Speak? Ha!) and how much time you spent at that level. Too subjective for you? Record the percentage of your maximum heart rate (MHR=220 minus your age) you reached for a sustained period during the workout. If your efforts don't rise above 7 on the PE scale or 60 to 85 percent of your MHR, it's time to challenge yourself more. ""Second only to showing up, intensity is the most important factor for achieving any fitness goal,"" says personal trainer Gregory Florez, CEO of FitAdvisor.com Health Coaching Service and spokesperson for the American Council on Exercise. ""Over time, the body adapts to the weight you lift or the distance you run; when that happens, it stops toning and burns fewer calories. Increasing intensity prevents this."" </p><p><b><br />Log this Energy Index </b><br /><b><br />To figure out:</b> Whether you're about to break up with your fitness plan<br /><b><br />How to use the intel: </b>Women whose primary workout motivation is weight loss spend 40 percent less time exercising than those who do it for other reasons, like maintaining overall health and relieving stress, according to a 2006 University of Michigan study. To make sure your regimen is making you happy, note your Energy Index (EI): how you feel on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being in the dumps and 5 being ready for anything. Also note the reason for the number you selected: Were you sore? Tired? Agitated? Eyeball the chart every Sunday. If your score dips below a 3 for five workouts in a row, one of a few things is happening: You're overdoing it, you're slacking, or you're stinking bored. The bottom line: It's time to tweak your routine. Instead of the treadmill, try a step or kickboxing class, or do a circuit: Between sets, jump rope, run in place, do jumping jacks or knee lifts--for one minute. <br /><b><br />Log this Body Fat</b><br /><b><br />To find out: </b>How much fat you're replacing with muscle<br /><b><br />How to use the intel:</b> Watching your body fat shrink is proof that you're getting not only stronger but also healthier, since excess body fat increases your risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Use this number to motivate yourself to get your ever-more-chiseled butt to the workout room. Many gyms have ""bio­electrical impedance analysis"" scales that compute your body-fat percentage by tracking how quickly an electrical current travels through your body (don't worry, you won't feel a thing). Because muscles are nearly 70 percent water and fat contains almost no H2O, the faster the signal travels, the more muscle you have. Don't have access to one of these scales? Use a measuring tape to calculate the circumference of your waist at the belly button. Say it comes out to 30 inches, and last month it was 32. That's 2 inches of fat you've lost--fat that's being replaced by ­muscle, which takes up less room. Either way, measure and log this number only once a month: That's about how long it can take to achieve a noticeable change. </p>",

Click Here,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1009-online-medicine.jpg,"<p>Deena Biengardo, 26, is always on the go. She's an energetic, slim New Yorker who walks just about everywhere. You'd never guess she was recently 70 pounds overweight or that she regularly pricks herself with a giant needle full of meds-or that she has multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease that affects some 400,000 Americans. Thanks to her laptop, she has found what she calls her ""miracle cure"" and claims to show few symptoms.<br /><br /><br /><br />After her diagnosis in 2005, Deena took to Google and landed at PatientsLikeMe.com, a new type of health site that lets members share very specific information about symptoms and treatments. There, she networked with other MS patients, who not only buoyed her emotionally but also offered the kind of advice her everrotating cast of neurologists couldn't: concrete tips on managing prescription side effects, from people who had real-life experience with the illness. ""It was then that I realized I could take control,"" she says of reading other patients' success stories, especially those that involved managing the disease through exercise and diet adjustments. Inspired, Deena started to slim down. ""The site changed the way I view my future,"" she says.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Sharing Shift</b><br /><br /><br />Searching the Internet for medical info is hardly new; a recent Pew Research Center study found that 61 percent of Americans do it. But millions of women like Deena are taking their online activity to new levels. By flocking to free sites like PatientsLikeMe and HealthCentral.com, they're helping to grow Facebook-style social networking communities-but instead of trading birthday wishes, they're posting their private medical histories, tracking daily pain levels, powwowing about Rx reactions, and even volunteering to be guinea pigs for experimental drugs. And by openly sharing the kind of intimate medical details people used to shield, they're creating huge health databases.<br /><br /><br /><br />Yup, it's Health 2.0, where medicine meets crowd sourcing. The idea? Sharing is good. Like, <i>really</i> good. A recent California HealthCare Foundation report confirmed that when patients swap health stories, their collective wisdom yields clinical insights far better than what they'd learn in a doc's office. That's no surprise to Thomas Goetz, author of <i>The Decision Tree: Taking Control of Your Health in the New Era of Personalized Medicine</i>. He points to a larger societal shift toward sharing-most of us now shrug at typing in credit card numbers or going viral with our relationship statuses, so why not divulge the results of a blood test?-and likens health info to currency. Publicly tracking your medical details online is like managing an investment account, says Goetz. Sure, it's riskier than a passive approach, but the rewards are exponentially greater. Ben Heywood, cofounder of PatientsLikeMe, puts it this way: ""People are realizing that not sharing might be getting in the way of deeper understanding, and that privacy might actually be bad for your health.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Exploding Communities</b><br /><br /><br />Alexandra Carmichael, 34, is on the forefront of user-generated health care. Throughout her twenties, the Mountain View, California-based entrepreneur lived with searing vaginal pain that made having sex nearly impossible. She bounced from gyno to gyno, eventually finding relief for her condition, called vulvodynia, through hormone replacement therapy. Frustrated that it took her 10 years to get there-and that she could never find good enough info online-Alexandra in 2008 launched CureTogether.com, a free site that lets people share, review, and track their illnesses and treatments, informing one another about which factors, from diet to menstrual cycles to sleep patterns, most affect their symptoms.<br /><br /><br /><br />At its inception two years ago, CureTogether focused on three illnesses. But users bombarded Alexandra with requests for more disease communities, and today the site holds data on about 500 conditions, everything from bipolar disorder to restless leg syndrome. And PatientsLikeMe has doubled in size in the past year, with the seemingly achievable goal of having 1 million members within the next two years. HealthCentral, which combines social networking with articles like those on WebMD.com, attracts some 13 million visitors a month. (WebMD, meanwhile, is still the most visited health site. Earlier this year, it launched its own networking forum, WebMD Health Exchange.)<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>The Drug-Company Connection</b><br /><br /><br />The online sharefest is providing medical researchers with a veritable goldmine of information. In fact, PatientsLikeMe makes money by anonymizing its content before selling it to drug companies-with member consent. Buyers receive spreadsheets of patients' symptoms and drug reactions, and use the info when creating new products. Earlier this year, for example, pharma giant UCB helped PatientsLikeMe start an epilepsy site in order to learn more about what prescriptions might be most popular. PatientsLikeMe also offers users early opportunities to volunteer for pharma-sponsored clinical trials. In effect, the sites are creating a new health-care dynamic: Industry heavyweights pay for access to data that's not available anywhere else, and in return, patients receive shortcuts to experimental drugs and, hopefully, have a voice in accelerating research. (After Novartis partnered with PatientsLikeMe in 2008 to find participants for a new MS medication study, interest was so huge that the trial was fast-tracked.)<br /><br /><br /><br />And sometimes members of the virtual health community simply run their own versions of clinical trials. When a <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i> article suggested that lithium-generally used to treat bipolar disorder-might also help control the symptoms of ALS (a.k.a. Lou Gehrig's disease), 400 PatientsLikeMe members with the disease began taking the drug under the supervision of their respective doctors. Within months, more than 2,000 members-all posting their reactions and blood-test results online-were in on the experiment, creating the world's first grassroots, patient-driven drug trial. Four traditional clinic-based trials started soon after, and all five studies reached the same disappointing conclusion: Lithium doesn't help ALS patients. Unlike the professional scientists, however, PatientsLikeMe shared its results right away, and millions of research dollars hadn't been spent.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>The Case for Discretion</b><br /><br /><br />Controlling your own health care is heady stuff. But privacy activists warn that the line between patient empowerment and exploitation can be razor thin. Though most sites are open about their partnerships, it's hard to know whether patient data is really going toward cutting-edge research or being used for targeted marketing efforts, says Jeff Chester, director of the non-profit Center for Digital Democracy. Particularly worrisome, he notes, are ""disease awareness"" sites like CrohnsAndMe.com, a site that looks like a social networking community but is actually a sponsored marketing tool funded by a pharmaceutical company. Chester points out that health sites always list their drug-company affiliations somewhere, even if it's not obvious, so do some digging into parent companies through the ""About Us"" and ""Contact Us"" links. And, says Chester, always employ healthy skepticism. Even if a marketing site seems helpful, it might minimize information about drug side effects.<br /><br /><br /><br />Many doctors are also concerned that patients will use these health-sharing sites without the input of their physicians. Quasar Choudhury, M.D., an internist in New York City, oversaw Deena Biengardo's MS treatment and talked her through the treatment options she found online. But without such sustained doctorpatient contact, he says, misinformation or data overload could be a problem. PatientsLikeMe's Heywood agrees and stresses you should never use these sites as your sole source of guidance.<br /><br /><br /><br />Still, Choudhury is impressed by the quality of research Deena was able to find online-and even more impressed by the psychological boost she got from the site's social network. ""The difference was unbelievable,"" he says. ""Her life changed far more dramatically than it would have through my treatment alone.""<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Net Results</b><br /><br /><br />These sites go several steps beyond the old online model.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>1</b> PatientsLikeMe.com Founded by three MIT engineers in 2004. The site's largest communities are dedicated to ALS, epilepsy, and fibromyalgia.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>2</b> HealthCentral.com A solid general URL with more than 35 disease communities, plus a symptom checker that allows you to pinpoint your pain on an illustrated body diagram.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>3</b> ACOR.org The Association of Cancer Online Resources' site hosts OncoChat.org, a real-time chat room that lets cancer patients and survivors exchange information and support.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>4</b> Keas.com This tracking site helps users set healthmanagement goals, especially those related to weight, depression, and diabetes. It also sends out test and checkup reminders, breaks down lab results, and runs Q&A's in its community section.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>5</b> CureTogether.com The two-year-old community website's main focus is tracking and maintaining members' health data, especially for conditions that affect women, such as endometriosis, vulvodynia, and irritable bowel syndrome.<br /><br /></p><p><br /></p>",

""And we're just beginning to understand its complexity.""</p><p>In a new study at DePauw, volunteers were asked to communicate a list of emotions by briefly touching a blindfolded stranger-and it actually worked. They were able to impart anger, fear, love, gratitude, sympathy, disgust, and sadness with up to 78 percent accuracy.

""The oxytocin that was released helped to diminish their loneliness,"" says study author Berit Seiger Cronfalk, Ph.D. OK, maybe you're not going to start rubbing a mourner's feet, but Cronfalk says that any touch in a crisis- holding someone's hand or hugging them-is a powerful form of comfort.</p><p><strong>Build a Stronger Team</strong><br />Ever wonder why men, sports, and butt patting seem to go together? ""In team activities, friendly touch builds trust and social connections,"" says Dacher Keltner, Ph.D., author of a study at the University of California at Berkeley. After analyzing NBA games, researchers found that the more chest bumps, hugs, high fives, and yes, even butt pats there were, the closer and more effective the team was-and the better its performance. So when you're doing a group project or playing in a sports league, fist bumps and other such contact (yeah, keep your hands off the backsides) can help everyone work better...and work better together.</p><p><strong>Reduce Stress</strong><br />""Along with diet and exercise, add a daily dose of touch to stay at a healthy peak,"" says Tiffany Field, Ph.D., director of the Touch Research Institute at the University of Miami School of Medicine. A recent study from Brigham Young University found that when couples gave each other frequent massages, both the men and women had higher levels of oxytocin and lower amounts of stress hormones. If you're on your own, doing yoga or getting a massage or pedicure can send calming messages to the brain.</p>",

This month, Glassman launches a revolutionary way of eating in her new book, <em>The O2 Diet</em>, which is based on the foods that have the highest antioxidant activity levels. This plan will make it super-simple for you to shed pounds, look fabulous, boost your energy, and amp up your brainpower.</p><p>Glassman's plan is based on the ORAC scale-a scientific value that represents the antioxidant levels of foods. (ORAC stands for oxygen radical absorbance capacity.) Using this scale, she has devised a diet that gets you 30,000 ORAC points a day-10 times the current recommended level of 3,000. It's those mega ORAC points that scoop up free radicals, the damaging rogue elements in our bodies that contribute to everything from wrinkles and brain fog to cancer and heart disease.</p><p>And you can say good-bye to calorie counting: By focusing on high ORAC scores, you'll chow down on foods that are healthy and have the right proportion of nutrients, so the extra weight will come off more easily.</p><p>In her book, Glassman explains how certain high-ORAC fruits and vegetables have specific powers. Load up on these antioxidant superstars every time you hit the grocery store-they'll help you bring out your healthy best in these five ways.</p><p><strong>1 LOSE WEIGHT WITHOUT TRYING</strong><br />On the O2 Diet, estimate that you'll lose about two to three pounds a week. But instead of worrying about the pounds, focus on ORAC points-and the pounds will melt away. These are just three of the O2 Diet's weight-loss wonders:</p><p><strong>ARTICHOKES:</strong> At only 60 calories each, they're a calorie bargain. Artichokes are also super-high on the ORAC scale-7,900 points-and they contain phytochemicals that may lower cholesterol levels.</p><p><strong>LEMON WATER:</strong> Lemon peel contains pectin, a soluble fiber that has been shown to help with weight loss. Add an ounce of lemon juice and some zest to each of your eight daily glasses of water (which will help you feel fuller), and you'll add 3,200 ORAC points.</p><p><strong>RED GRAPEFRUIT:</strong> One study found that people who ate half a grapefruit with each meal lost 3.6 pounds over 12 weeks, while those who drank grapefruit juice three times a day lost 3.3 pounds. The red variety has more of the cancer-protecting antioxidant lycopene. Half a grape-fruit has 1,900 ORAC points.</p><p><strong>2 MAKE YOUR SKIN GLOW</strong><br />While no food can turn back the clock, some can perk up your looks and slow the aging process.</p><p><strong>FIGS:</strong> Eating a handful of dried figs increases the amount of antioxidants in your blood for four hours, much longer than many other foods. Two small figs have about 2,700 ORAC points.</p><p><strong>RED BELL PEPPERS:</strong> The unique combination of large amounts of vitamins A, C, and E make red bell peppers a skin superfood. Half a cup adds 600 ORAC points.</p><p><strong>WATERMELON:</strong> This lycopene-rich fruit provides 33 percent more protection against sunburn than other fruits. (You still have to wear sunscreen though!) One cup of this diced melon has 200 ORAC points.</p><p><strong>3 BOLSTER YOURBODY</strong><br />Certain antioxidants have been shown to fight cancer, boost immunity, and keep bones strong.</p><p><strong>BEANS:</strong> They're loaded with phytochemicals (including saponins, protease inhibitors, and phytic acid), which may protect cells from damage that potentially causes cancer, reports the American Institute for Cancer Research. Half a cup has 7,800 ORAC points.</p><p><strong>PRUNES:</strong> These wrinkly little dried fruits are rich in vitamin K and a top source of the mineral boron, and we need both for strong bones. A three-prune serving gives you 1,900 ORAC points.</p><p><strong>4 WARD OFF HEART DISEASE</strong><br />Young women tend to be oblivious to heart disease, but that attitude itself is a big risk. How you eat today helps predict how healthy your heart will be 30 years from now.</p><p><strong>CHERRIES:</strong> Researchers at the University of Michigan have found that the anthocyanins in dark cherries reduce belly fat and lower cholesterol and blood sugar; one serving packs 3,500 ORAC points.</p><p><strong>DARK CHOCOLATE:</strong> Rich in flavonoids, chocolate is believed to promote heart health by reducing platelet activation, affecting the relaxation capabilities of blood vessels. One ounce of dark chocolate has 5,900 ORAC points.</p><p><strong>5 BOOST YOUR BRAINPOWER</strong><br />The neural pathways in our brains are growing and improving all the time. Eat the right foods and you'll be able to concentrate better, remember more, and feel calmer.</p><p><strong>BLUEBERRIES:</strong> They may improve memory, cognition, and balance. Researchers believe that blueberries (9,700 ORAC points per one-cup serving) reduce inflammation and can help us overcome the normal effects of brain aging.</p><p><strong>CINNAMON:</strong> Researchers believe that cinnamon may inhibit certain Alzheimer's disease cells. One teaspoon of cinnamon adds 7,000 ORAC points.</p><p><strong>PLUMS: </strong>These juicy treats decrease anxiety-related behaviors, and researchers think they may protect against depression. One plum adds 4,100 ORAC points to a meal.</p><p>Adapted from <em>The O2 Diet: The Cutting Edge Antioxidant- Based Program That Will Make You Healthy, Thin, and Beautiful</em>, by Keri Glassman, R.D., Rodale 2009.</p><p><strong>RELATED:</strong> <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/healthy-treats"">Healthy Indulgences</a></p>",best tips ever
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/sex-up-your-soiree,Sex And Relationships,4,4,1,0,1,0,0,0,,Pleasure Party!,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0606-schtupperware-par-0844.jpg,"I've thrown my share of cocktail hours, but none has ever been met with as much enthusiasm as the one I hosted this past February: 15 RSVPs within minutes of sending my e-vite! The night of the gathering, I lit candles and laid out an impressive spread: wine, cheese, olives, and chocolate-dipped strawberries. The only thing missing was a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/sex-toy-or-household-object-quiz"">vibrator</a> - or thirty. <br /><br />This wasn't just any get-together; this was a ""romance party."" The adult industry has dubbed these private <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/have-better-sex-1"">sex</a> toy sales gatherings the ""Tupperware parties"" of our generation. Top pleasure party companies boast annual sales of up to $60 million and yearly growth rates of more than 60 percent. Their spiel? During the 1950s, sealable plastic containers were crucial to a housewife's arsenal. Selling them gave her extra pocket money without sacrificing family time. And the products offered a convenient way to invest in her family's well-being - and her marriage - through food. Tupperware is still going strong - selling $195 million worth of product in 2004 in North America alone. But now, armed with body paints and vibrating panties, women are looking to heat things up outside the kitchen. <br /><br />How do these companies work? Sales consultants (or reps) buy products wholesale and travel from party to party, turning guests into customers by selling the stuff at a markup. They make a commission based on sales, with incentives like pink Pontiacs and Caribbean vacations to encourage their money-making mojo. A party hostess provides the guests, the venue, and the food - in return, she receives free products and other incentives, like the chance to win a cruise.<br /><br />Sounds great, but because of Tupperware's housewifey reputation, I figured <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/how-to-host-a-pleasure-party"">home-based romance parties</a> weren't for my friends and me: a free-spirited, no-bullshit, sexually confident bunch of 20- and 30-somethings. Half are single, and all own at least one vibrator. Even those in marriages and long-term relationships whip out the Kama Sutra kit now and then. What could these shindigs offer that we didn't already know? And what better way to find out than by throwing one myself?<br /><br /><b>The Right Vibe </b><br /><br />Like any good hostess, I research which company will best suit my guests before I commit to a brand. This means I wind up listening to gimmicky reps tell me that it's a real hoot to surprise my man with a blindfold. And if I'm lucky, he'll drop the remote when he sees me in a baby-doll dress with bows over my peppermint-flavored nipples! Spare me. Which is why I'm thrilled when Pure Romance's spokesperson tells me about its affiliation with Indiana University (home of the Kinsey Institute), its breast cancer outreach program, and its naughty but tasteful products. She says 70 percent of sales are items used for clitoral stimulation and that most customers are between the ages of 28 and 41. Yes! She mentions that Pure Romance doles out over $1 million in prizes and incentives - including jewelry, cars, and five-star holidays. Yes! She adds that I'll receive a hostess gift and a gift certificate, plus qualify to win a $2,500 shopping spree or $250 cash card. Yes! Yes! Yes!<br /><br />The day of the party, Michelle Clements, a Pure Romance consultant, flies in from her Ohio headquarters with a suitcase full of booty: body paints, ticklers, bondage kits, card games, vibrating sponges, and more - all of which must have confused the hell out of the security people at the airport. She starts by telling us to designate one hand a ""licker"" and the other a ""sniffer."" Beyond smirking at Michelle's odd vocab, we do as we're told. We try fruit-scented powders, lubricants, body mists, and shaving creams. Aside from a few nervous laughs, we test and examine the stuff with the intensity of researchers working on a new wonder drug. Hey, we take these things seriously. <br /><br />Judging by the rate at which my guests lick, sniff, and discuss, a cinnamon-flavored lube is the big hit. It warms the penis when you rub it and becomes hot when you blow on it. Other must-haves: Sinfully Sweet body paints that taste like poolside cocktails and 5 Flavor Great Head multipack gels that relax the gag reflex. Flavor plus function revs our imaginations, and here's where at-home parties excel: We can test these products in the privacy of someone's home. Otherwise, we might overlook a real, um, bang-for-your-buck $12 purchase. <br /><br /><b>The Loot of Love</b><br /><br />After we take a short break to top off our wine, the party hits its stride. Michelle tosses us each a whizzing vibe - which my guests inspect carefully, the way they'd shop for the perfect pair of slingbacks. Amy, a newlywed, even takes camera-phone shots and sends them to her hubby for approval (there's no way men ever cared this much about ice-cube trays). The most buzzed-about vibrators are the waterproof G-Money, which curves to stimulate the G-spot, and Decadent Indulgence, which boasts three motions, rotating beads, and a Mitsubishi motor. We juggle the toys among us and swap our own tips and anecdotes about using vibrating rings and giving handjobs. ""For a topic so personal, the atmosphere makes it easy to be down, dirty, and honest,"" my friend Karen whispers to me. ""And Michelle really seems to know her stuff. If she tells me that the Hot Buttered Rum lube can cure my near-sightedness, I'll goop some in my eyes."" <br /><br />Michelle makes individual sales to guests who rush to be first in line. My friend Gillian announces that she's considering rep work, and I overhear Liz say she plans to throw a party. My friends are open-minded, but I never knew they were so sexually entrepreneurial. The comfortable atmosphere - along with product variety and purchasing convenience - buoyed our buying enthusiasm. And given the range of companies pitching to a mainstream audi_ence, it's clear that women are willing to invest in their own well-being - with or without a partner. To hell with frozen turkey casseroles. We'll order pizza and put the time saved to better use in bed.<br /><br />",Better Sex

So while our <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/yoga/the-sex-benefits-of-yoga"">sex life </a>is anything but broken, it could be even hotter. Allow me to elaborate.<br /><br /><b>Gripe No. 1:</b> I believe I should <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/anatomy-of-an-orgasm"">orgasm</a> faster than a 14-year-old boy with a copy of Maxim. When I can't, I give up. <b>Gripe No. 2:</b> Dan and I have different schedules, which means I'll return from a late workout, endorphins blazing, just as he's polishing off a chihuahua-size burrito. The really embarrassing bit is <b>Gripe No. 3:</b> Despite being a professional body image speaker and author, I'm as self-conscious about my butt as Nora Ephron is about her neck. When naked, I insist on walking backward away from the bed in a sort of modified grapevine, terrified that my husband (!) will catch a glimpse of cellulite.<br /><br />Sex therapy may be an obvious fix, but I'd always pegged it as one of those things normal people don't do. I'd never even considered it until WH asked me to write about the Berman Center, a Chicago sex clinic run by Laura Berman, Ph.D., aka the Dr. Phil of getting your freak on. Apparently my misgivings gel with popular opinion: ""I've found that 50 percent of people are not satisfied with their sex lives,"" Berman says. ""But only 10 percent of men and 20 percent of women seek help."" Well, change begins with me, so I e-mail my concerns to Berman, and she recommends I sign up for an intensive 3-day retreat that will address everything from sexual inhibitions to stress management and teach us <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/have-better-sex-1"">how to have better sex</a>. Which brings me to my ...<br /> <b>Day 1: 9 to 10 a.m./Q&A With The Sex Swami</b><br /><br />I meet Berman in her brightly lit downtown office, which looks more like a spa than a medical institution. Sitting in a red chair, her blonde hair held back with a black headband, Berman makes eye contact, shoots me an easy smile, and hands me a binder filled with my personalized schedule, journal, and a slew of questionnaires, including a ""depression inventory"" and a ""genital image scale."" <i>Holy crap, what have I gotten myself into?</i><br /><br />I sink into the couch and set my water glass down on a kitschy more medication, please coaster. Before I know it, we're discussing my sexual history (four male partners plus a short-lived stint of drunken heteroflexibility that culminated in my waking up with a raging hangover and a naked 21-year-old named Valerie); the cues I received about sex and love from my family (tons of laughter and affection, no divorces, and ""Put an aspirin between your knees and never let it fall"" from my father before every high school date); and how Dan and I ultimately came to be (8 years of best-friendship followed by his dogged pursuit). It's a lot to cough up so soon, and just as we really start to dig in, she tells me we have to stop so that I can get to my <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-relationships/spice-up-your-sex-life"">Tantra</a> lesson.<br /><br />Tantra lesson?<br /><br /><b>11 a.m. to 1 p.m. / Booty Breathing</b><br /><br />To help me rethink my orgasm-centric mentality, Berman has sent me to the TantraNova Institute, a Chicago clinic that teaches ""the ancient art of sacred Tantric sexuality."" I'm greeted by ""beloveds"" and business partners Elsbeth Meuth, Ed.D., 58, petite with ultra-short blonde hair and a thick German accent, and Freddy Zental Weaver, 51, a towering, handsome man with rich, chocolate brown skin. They lead me into a studio filled with candles, silk pillows, and a floor-to-ceiling painting of a figure with seven chakras ablaze. (For those of you who don't have the token yoga-obsessed friend, chakras are ""energy centers"" that run roughly from the base of the spine to just above the head. They're associated with a wide range of physical and mental states -- the throat chakra with communication, the heart chakra with love, and so on.)<br /><br />I sit cross-legged on the floor; the Tantric duo faces me. Freddy guides us through a meditation exercise. His voice is so smooth I can't believe it's not butter. As we inhale, Elsbeth explains the importance of breath: By circulating it through our bodies, we create energy, enhancing sex and, for the truly practiced and fortunate, paving the way to whole-body orgasms.<br /><br />My homework, Freddy tells me, is to ""self-love,"" perhaps the most PC term ever for masturbation. But orgasm is not the goal. I should encounter myself as my own lover, setting the scene with flowers, music, oils. The purpose of this exercise, Elsbeth explains, is to enjoy the sensations rather than rushing to completion. After caressing my hands, arms, and stomach, I may wish to move on to my ""yoni"" (Sanskrit for ""cooch""). ""Start by massaging her,"" Freddy encourages as I scribble down notes. ""Dance on the edge of orgasm."" I want to blurt out, ""Didn't I see that in a Hallmark card?"" but keep mum, engrossed in thoughts of tonight's assignment. Before my yoni gets any self-loving, though, I need to cab it back to Berman's to meet my husband for our first and only couples session.<br /><br /><b>1:45 to 3 p.m. / Dan, Enter Stage Right</b><br /><br />""So, Dan, how would you classify your sexual relationship?""<br /><br />My guy is such a sport. He really didn't want to air our sexual laundry on a national clothesline, but he's so supportive of my career -- and our relationship -- that he folded. He opens up to Berman immediately, describing it almost exactly as I would. ""We're happy, extremely affectionatelots of kissing and cuddling."" He concedes that we are intimate less often than we used to be, due to dueling schedules and his back injury, and that he'd like to get it on more often.<br /><br />We brainstorm ways to become more sexually proactive. Berman suggests scheduling sex, but we deplore the idea of PDAing our PDA. She counters, ""Most young couples today have to make a paradigm shift: Instead of saying, 'Ugh, scheduling sex is a chore,' make it something you can look forward to."" Or we can encourage nooky to occur more organically by freeing up time at night. I need to set boundaries between my work and personal life, Dr. B. explains, for the sake of my mental and sexual health. Can I put aside 2 hours at night with no work? I balk. ""Think about it as productive time for your relationship and it won't feel so gluttonous,"" she says. We compromise on an hour.<br /><br />Then she brings up the rear: ""What do you think about her butt issue?"" she asks, looking at Dan.<br /><br />He laughs, describing it as firm and strong, but I blurt out that he's lying and before I know it, I'm crying. This is ridiculous. I was anorexic in college but have been recovered for over a decade.<br /><br />Berman posits that my caboose complex is a remnant of self-loathing I experienced with my eating disorder. For tonight I am assigned the charming task of standing before him, naked and ass-backward. Oh, and to have sex too.<br /><br /><b>8 to 9 p.m. / I Touch Myself</b><br /><br />That night, I am surprisingly psyched for self-love. I close the bedroom door and cue up Sade. A citrus tea light twinkles from my dresser, guiding my way toward the bed, which I've covered with an old beach towel to protect the sheets from massage oil.<br /><br />I take a few deep breaths and am ready to love all my 2,000 parts. ""Smooth Operator"" plays in the background as I stroke my arms, discovering that my wrists are pleasingly sensitive, especially when lightly tickled. I drizzle more oil over my stomach and breasts and enjoy dreamy rubbing for about 10 minutes. I know orgasm isn't the goal of this assignment, but a vibrator beckons from my bedside drawer, so I succumb, self-loving myself three times in a row. <i>Bad student!</i> I was supposed to massage my entire body but skipped my legs, back, and butt. I should have paid more attention to the directions rather than jump to my fast and furious conclusion. Obviously, this is an area I need to work on. But, hey, it was much easier to climax after all that caressing.<br /><br /><b>10 to 11 p.m. / Bringing Sexy Back</b><br /><br />I steel myself for the butt exercise. I position Dan on the edge of the bed, proudly presenting my front half -- I love my perky breasts and toned stomach. I don't know what scares me more: that my man, who loves me unconditionally, might be turned off, or that I might realize he really does love all of me -- <i>and then what will I have to obsess over?</i> After a few frustrating minutes I say, ""F@&! it,"" and rotate. Words like ""cellulite"" and ""nutcase"" zap through my mind. Dan kisses my back and whispers I am beautiful. We wind up having a nice heart-to-heart in bed, during which he gently confronts my perfectionism, asking me if I would love him less if his butt were, say, not up to Brad Pitt standards. Okay, he's got a point. He kindly calls supermodel Gisele ""an airbrushed freak,"" and since we're already horizontal, we switch off the light and continue the oral conversation.<br /><br /><b>Day 2: 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. / Q&A, Take Two</b><br /><br />I recount the butt experiment to Berman, explaining how caring Dan was and how hypocritical I, as a body image speaker, felt having to admit this eating disorder leftover. She explains that with my perfectionist tendencies, my tush is symbolic of my need for control. ""When you have really high expectations -- of how you look, what you're supposed to accomplish, how you do at work -- you set yourself up for failure and disappointment,"" she says. Same goes for orgasms: If they're not happening <i>right now</i>, I think I've failed. Ironically, the more someone worries about climaxing, the more stress it creates, Berman explains. ""An orgasm is the epitome of letting go."" I need to be easier on myself and relinquish control.<br /><br />This is starting to resemble conventional therapy, and I suggest we focus more on sex. Berman smiles firmly and shakes her head no. ""Who you are is the sum of your life experiences -- psychological, emotional, and sexual."" While sex therapy, in its purest form, addresses sexual challenges in a relationship by helping you relearn behaviors, Berman likes to intertwine it with general as well as couples therapy, which explores the inner workings of the relationship.<br /><br />My hour of psychoanalysis flies by in what feels like 10 minutes, and it's time for me to shut up and dance. Enter Miss Exotic World 2005, Michelle ""The Ass That Goes Pow!"" L'amour.<br /><br /><b>2 to 3 p.m. / Burlesque Is Best</b><br /><br />I warm up in the Berman Center yoga studio, swiveling my hips to drum-thumping music with L'amour, 27, a tiny, hazel-eyed brunette. You might think you'd be too shy to faux-striptease with a total stranger, but that's because you've never met L'amour. She's like the straight-talking love child of Eartha Kitt and Shakira, sexy and unassuming in a pint-size package. She hands me a pink boa and satin gloves and shows me how to shimmy, to ""present"" my breasts (by cupping and lifting from beneath), and to tug my gloves off with my teeth. We talk about how burlesque appeals to women because it explores different definitions of ""sexy"": intelligent, humorous, playful. She describes it as ""a very encouraging way to showcase curves."" I can see why Berman has clients with body image issues try it. L'amour runs me through my routine once more and sends me home to show my husband some T&A.<br /><br /><b>11 p.m. / Meet The Next Pussycat Doll...Meow</b><br /><br />Back home, Dan is waiting for me in the living room while I check myself out in the bathroom mirror. Black push-up bra, check. Matching thong, check. Gloves, check. Pink Hello Kitty boa from my 30th birthday party, check.<br /><br />As ""Fever"" plays from my computer, I totter over to the couch in my patent-leather heels, a nervous smile plastered across my face. But I channel my inner Dita Von Teese and begin with a slow hip rotation, stroking my boa and sliding my satin gloves down my neck and around my breasts. I even do the move where I turn around, bend over, and slap that ass. I end up straddling Dan's lap. He has enjoyed the show. And even though the elaborate moves were seductive, he says the best part was seeing my near-naked body.<br /><br /><b>Day 3:10 a.m. to noon / Final Session</b><br /><br />Back at the center, the topic of the day is control. Berman suggests that the control freak in me might surrender if Dan were extra-aggressive in the bedroom. In fact, she says, the most common fantasy women have is feeling powerless. Because I feel safe with Dan, I can give up the wheel and enjoy the ride. This will be therapeutic, Berman promises, so I deviously plot charging handcuffs and a whip to his Flexible Spending Account.<br /><br />I dash off an e-mail to Dan -- Subject: <i>Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept It</i> -- and stop at Freddy and Elsbeth's for a rousing round of Kegels, designed to enliven my sexual center and enhance orgasm. We do them together, chanting, ""Squeeze, release, squeeze, release."" It's Genital Jazzercise! They encourage me to do these every day: in the car, while writing. Soon my vagina will drop a size and crave protein bars.<br /><br />Feeling tingly, I return home. I can't wait for tonight's hard-hitting homework assignment: caveman sex.<br /><br /><b>10 p.m. / Neander-Thrall</b><br /><br />We're snuggling harmlessly in bed, and I get up to pee. When I come back, the room becomes a blur of bathrobe, boxer shorts, and bed sheets. Next, I'm against the wall, arms pinned overhead. Then I'm launched through the air, landing on a pile of pillows. Now I'm on my knees-- but despite prior concerns I'm pretty sure my ass looks great. The sex is rough, and after all this talking and reflecting, I can finally let go and say, ""Ahhhh.""<br />","Better Sex,relationships"

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/lasik-surgery,Health,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,,Lasik Surgery Isn't the Only Option,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0810-vision-quest.jpg,"<p>Sick of needing your specs to find your contact lens case? Before you dial 1-800-LASIK, consider this: One in four patients who ask for <a href=""/health/laser-eye-surgery"">lasik surgery</a> are considered poor candidates, so they're less likely to end up with eagle <a href=""/health/what039s-your-eye-q"">eyes</a> and more likely to experience side effects like dryness and glare, says Helen Wu, M.D., of Tufts University's New England Eye Center. Fortunately, these alternatives to laser surgery also get you looking sharp. </p><p><b>Lasik</b><br />$1,000-$2,500 per eye<br /><b>Best for</b> Those with healthy corneas who are mildly to moderately near- or farsighted. Your vision must also be stable (meaning your prescription hasn't changed in the past year).<br /><b>How It Works</b> The surgeon cuts a small flap of tissue on the eye's surface. A computer-guided laser then reshapes the cornea underneath and the flap is repositioned.<br /><b>Pros</b> You'll see clearly within 24 hours with minimal discomfort. <br /><b>Cons </b>Doubles matches are out for a month or so--getting hit in the eye soon after Lasik could displace the flap of tissue. Nerve receptors that tell your brain to make tears can sometimes get snipped during surgery, leaving your eyes feeling dry and gritty. </p><p><b>Wave Front-Guided PRK </b><br />$1,500-$2,700 per eye<br /><b>Best for</b> People with thinner corneas or dry eyes, and <a href=""/beauty-and-style/beauty-secrets-from-elite-athletes"">athletes</a> who don't want to take the month off after Lasik. <br /><b>How It Works </b>One of the riskiest parts of Lasik is the incision. This technique requires no such cut: Instead, a laser is used to create a 3-D map of your eye, then a second laser reshapes the top layer of the cornea.<br /><b>Pros </b>Because there's no cutting involved, there's also no risk that you'll need to stock up on artificial tears. <br /><b>Cons</b> Your vision will be blurry for four to six days. And because part of the top layer of the eye is removed, the risk of infection is higher than it is with Lasik--1 in 1,000 compared with 1 in 10,000. </p><p><b>Phakic Intraocular Lens Implant</b><br />$2,600-$4,000 per eye<br /><b>Best for</b> People who are severely nearsighted or have thin or unusually shaped corneas. <br /><b>How It Works </b>The soft plastic lens--think of it as a permanent contact--is inserted either in front of or behind the iris. (Don't worry, you can't feel it once it's in place.)<br /><b>Pros</b> You'll be able to make out the digits on your <a href=""/health/alarm-clocks"">alarm clock</a> the next morning. And if you have a change of heart, the lenses can be removed. <br /><b>Cons</b> The procedure has been available for only a few years, so long-term side effects aren't very well known. Rare complications include infection or damage to the iris. </p><p><b>Refractive Lens Exchange</b><br />$2,000-$4,500 per eye<br /><b>Best for </b>Patients who have vision problems like far-sightedness (+6 or more) or who have cataracts or are at high risk of developing them. <br /><b>How It Works </b>Taking intraocular implants to the next level, this procedure actually replaces your eye's natural lens with a soft plastic one. <br /><b>Pros</b> Docs have been performing this procedure for years on patients with cataracts, which affect more than 20 million Americans age 40 and over.<br /><b>Cons</b> In severely nearsighted patients (with a prescription worse than -8), the procedure carries an increased risk of retinal detachment, which requires a second surgery to fix--if it can be fixed at all.</p>",Celebrities
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/dangers-of-grilling,Nutrition,5,4,0,1,0,1,0,0,,"Grill, Interrupted",http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0805-grill-interrupted.jpg,"<p>Just when you think you know what's making you old--pollution, free radicals, UVB rays--the brainiacs in white coats come up with a new cause for sudden memory lapses and wrinkles. This time, though, the culprit is something you can control. Researchers have found that some of the most common cooking methods--<a href=""/weight-loss/best-light-beers"" target=""_blank"">grilling</a>, frying, and microwaving--and the way we process some of our favorite foods (lunch meats, hotdogs, potato chips) react with sugars and fats in those edibles to create destructive compounds called advanced glycation end products (AGEs). These molecular pests can shift our aging process into fifth gear. ""If you have high amounts of AGEs in your body--no matter how young you are--you're on your way to developing chronic diseases you normally wouldn't see until you are much older,"" says Helen Vlassara, M.D., a professor of medicine and geriatrics at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City who specializes in AGE research. </p><p>But here's the upside: Cut your AGE consumption by half and you'll give Father Time the finger (and be less tempted to use Botox). ""When you cut back your AGE consumption, you'll save your eyesight, your memory, your skin, and your blood vessels,"" Vlassara says. </p><p><b>Too Hot to Handle</b></p><p>AGEs might not have made the headlines until recently, but they've been around ever since Neanderthals discovered fire and hosted their first caveside rave and boar roast. AGEs form when dry, high heat causes sugar and fat to break down into protein molecules that shrivel up and turn brown or black. Any time you see sear marks on <a href=""/nutrition/benefits-of-grass-fed-beef"" target=""_blank"">steak,</a> a crispy coating on fried chicken, or a golden crust on bread, you're looking at AGEs, says Guy A. Crosby, Ph.D., associate professor of chemistry and food science at Framingham (Massachusetts) State College and adjunct associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health.</p><p>Once they've gone down your gullet, AGEs live up to their nickname by attacking the cells that keep you young and healthy. First, in a desperate move to save themselves, these defective proteins bind to immune cells, causing them to become inflamed--and inflammation is a primary cause of age-related conditions such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, and heart disease. Making matters worse, AGEs also cause the formation of equally unstable free radicals, the destructive molecules that travel through your body damaging cells. This can lead to other serious health problems, such as cancer, and trigger signs of aging such as crow's feet and those ""Where the hell did I put my keys?"" moments.</p><p>Put simply: If AGEs were a SWAT team, they wouldn't exactly be the gang from <i>The Unit</i>. They spray a barrage of bullets, hitting innocent cells in their path.</p><p>It wouldn't be such a big deal if we had only a few AGEs in our systems--our body has had a million years to learn to deal with them. But over the past 50 years, we've upped our AGE intake dramatically, as we've moved away from eating farm-fresh food and toward consuming more processed products loaded with fats and added sugars and then cooked at high heat. In other words, AGE grenades.</p><p>""Many prepared foods are exposed to high temperatures to lengthen shelf life, so we're getting more AGEs than before,"" Vlassara says. And food manufacturers aren't the only problem: Combine those foods with the way we cook them--grilling, broiling, and microwaving, all involving dry, high, AGE-generating heat--and we're getting way more AGEs than our bodies can handle, Vlassara says.</p><p><b>AGE-less cooking</b></p><p>To find out what happens when you cut back on AGEs, Vlassara and her colleagues served one group of mice meals high in AGEs and another group food with half the amount. The low-AGE group lived 20 weeks longer than their less fortunate rodent friends. What do 20 additional mouse weeks translate to in human time? Roughly 12 years. </p><p>Now, before you go raw and donate your cherished outdoor grill and microwave to charity, know that you can still cook your food and cut back dramatically on AGEs. That's because AGEs have an arch nemesis: water.</p><p>Using cooking methods that involve lots of H2O slows the AGE-creation process because the liquid offsets the heat. So the more you cook with water, the more you stop AGEs. Three easy ways to do it: steaming, braising, and blanching.</p><p>Don't worry--blanching only sounds bland. By adding herbs and spices (whose antioxidants have their own anti-aging powers), your food will explode with flavor, not age-accelerating byproducts, says Michael Adams, chef/owner of The Farmhouse, a restaurant in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, and winner of the Best Pennsylvania Preferred Chef contest. Adams' tips for whipping up appetizing meals and minimizing AGEs:</p><p><b>Spa treatment </b>Planning to make veggies, chicken, fish, or pork for dinner? Adams recommends treating them to a tasty herbal steam bath. First, add one tablespoon of four to five herbs and spices to one quart of water. Cover and boil for seven to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to a low simmer and add chicken, pork, or fish. Cook the meat for about five minutes per pound. For veggies, place them in a steamer basket over the boiling herbal mixture for three minutes. Here are Adams' favorite blends for each type of food:<br /><b>Chicken, fish, or vegetables</b> garlic (smashed), ginger, lemongrass, scallions<br /><b>Root vegetables (beets, carrots, potatoes, turnips)</b> bay leaf, cloves, fennel, garlic, peppercorn, saffron<br /><b>Fish </b>bay leaf, mustard seed, peppercorn, tarragon</p><p><b>Simply Smashing Braising</b> is an easy technique that's perfect for beef and pork (large cuts such as roasts are the most commonly braised, but smaller cuts, such as chops and steaks, can be cooked this way as well): Pour a can of beef or chicken stock into a roasting pan, then add four smashed cloves of garlic, one bay leaf, a tablespoon of fennel seeds, a tablespoon of fresh thyme, and half a tablespoon of peppercorns. Place a three- to five-pound piece of beef or pork into the broth, leaving a quarter of the meat exposed. Cover and bake at 275°F to 300°F for two and a half to three hours. </p><p><b>Double Dip </b>It sounds like water torture for produce, but <b>blanching,</b> a process that involves quickly transferring veggies from boiling-hot to icy-cold water, makes for super-crisp, fresh-tasting sides. Try it on non-watery vegetables like asparagus, green beans, potatoes, snow peas, butternut squash, and summer squash. First add a tablespoon of four to five different herbs and spices to a quart of water and bring it to a boil. Drop the vegetables into the boiling water (one to two minutes for greens, two to three minutes for most other chopped veggies, and until tender for root veggies), then immediately remove and place in ice water for the same time they were in hot water, adding more ice as it melts. Take out of ice water and serve.</p><p><b>Damage control - AGE-defying tips</b><br />It'd be depressingly dull to cook using only water-based methods, and God knows most of us crave a juicy, grilled steak from time to time. But even when you do use high, dry heat, you can slash AGEs easily, Vlassara says. Try these AGE-reducing tricks when grilling, broiling, or microwaving:</p><p><b>Cut the fat</b> Since AGEs form when fat heats up, the less fat in a food, the fewer AGEs you'll get when you cook it. Vegetables are an obvious choice, of course. And when choosing proteins, go for fish or skinless chicken; or get adventurous and hunt down game meats like bison or venison, which are leaner than beef, says Dave Joachim, author of <i>Mastering the Grill</i>. When only beef will do, select lean cuts such as top loin sirloin, top round, eye of round, tip, and flank.</p><p><b>Take a soak</b> Marinate meat and fish in a mixture made from lemons, limes, pineapple, and other citrus fruit. Not only does the liquid limit the production of AGEs, but the acid in citrus fruit kills them too. Forget commercial marinades-most contain high-fructose corn syrup, an AGE building block. Instead, whip together one teaspoon of lemon zest, two tablespoons of cilantro, and two cloves of garlic in four tablespoons of olive oil; pour over chicken or beef. Let it marinate for at least an hour, Adams says.</p><p><b>Go undercover</b> Create tents with foil before grilling or broiling. And cover microwave dishes with plastic wrap. Both seal in the moisture that stops toxic AGEs in their tracks.</p><p><b>Fake it</b> Braise chicken or beef, then grill or pan-fry it for two minutes, Adams says. You'll get the look and taste you want without the AGEs.</p><p> </p>",Eating Strategies

I think there's something to that,"" says <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty-and-style/carla-guginos-favorite-beauty-products"">Carla Gugino</a>, who stars in the big-budget action flick <i>Watchmen</i>. It's a sunny afternoon, she's in a bustling New York trattoria, and she's true to her word. For brunch, she orders poached eggs over vegetables, espresso, and a slab of flourless chocolate cake, which she downs with a side of vitamins (more on those later). ""I'm an Italian,"" she says, grinning. ""And the Italian perspective is, love your curves.""<br /><br />Gugino's are certainly lovable. She's wearing a black dress that offers glimpses of her enviable cleavage; her legs, in black stockings and boots, are toned; and her dusky ivory skin looks like some kind of white chocolate dessert itself. She generates a vibe that is equal parts friendly and serene. She's in a good place, and she knows it.<br /><br />""My favorite thing is to have a big dinner with friends and talk about life,"" she says. ""They call me Mama Gugino, because if they're going to a city where I've worked, I can tell them every great restaurant and spa. I'm a sensualist. My two main indulgences are dark chocolate and massages.""<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/wh-on-access-hollywood"">Gugino</a>, 37, loves to relax, but she's also serious about work. It all started at age 13, when she did some modeling and began to act. The straight-A student emancipated herself at 16, and then appeared in everything from the sitcom <i>Spin City</i>, in which she played Michael J. Fox's girlfriend, to the graphic-novel-inspired action movie <i>Sin City</i>, whose lingerie scenes were graphic indeed. And it bears noting that her character on Entourage, hottie agent Amanda, is the only woman who has ever flummoxed Jeremy Piven's Ari Gold.<br /><br />But her career has never been hotter than now. Gugino has two new films: <i>Race to Witch Mountain</i>, a reworking of the kids' classic <i>Escape to Witch Mountain</i>, and <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/malin-akerman-workout""><i>Watchmen</i></a>, (alongside our other cover girl, <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/malin-akerman-interview"">Malin Akerman</a>), based on the hit graphic novel. Gugino plays costumed crime fighter Silk Spectre--and what a costume: a snug yellow and black dress with garters, stockings, and a single elbow-length glove.<br /><br />And make no mistake: Gugino has the attitude to pull it off. ""It was like, OK, let me embrace this,"" she says. ""The time span between <i>This Boy's Life</i> [the 1993 drama in which she played Robert DeNiro's daughter] and <i>Righteous Kill</i> [the 2008 thriller in which she played DeNiro's lover] gave me a context for how different we are at 18 versus 37. Back then I didn't know who I was; I just wanted to please everybody and be loved. One of the first directions that [<i>Boy's Life</i>] director Michael Caton Jones gave me was, 'You'd better be fucking good.' I was like a deer in the headlights! Now I'm in my body in a different way.<br /><br />""What I've realized,"" she says, ""is that we're our own harshest critics. We give ourselves limitations. But I want to push through that wall, on a creative and personal level. I could get hit by a bus today. So I might as well love the people I love, do what I love to do, and take as many risks as possible.""<br /><br />Gugino lives mainly in Los Angeles [she has a place in NYC too], with her boyfriend of 12 years, screenwriter Sebastian Gutierrez (<i>Snakes on a Plane</i>), and his two teenage children, ages 14 and 15. Marriage ""isn't important for us,"" Gugino says. ""We like being boyfriend and girlfriend; there's something sexy and fun about that. We're very much about, 'There's nothing holding us here other than our desire to be together.'""<br /><br />Gugino prefers to keep it playful: When she added a dressing room to her house, she included a space for a chair for Gutierrez to sit while she does ""fashion shows for him before a premiere,"" she says. ""I'll make him a cappuccino--I want him to be comfy--while I ask, 'Should I wear this or that?'"" Flipping through the movie previews on an airplane recently, she was amused to see that ""in all the American movies, something is blowing up, while in the European ones are people having sex. Here you can see a nipple blown off, but you can't see a woman walking to the bathroom after sex. It's weird, because to me, sexuality is a big part of who we are as humans, the way we connect.<br /><br />""I've done a lot of roles that include that element,"" she continues. ""[But] I've been taken seriously. I've worked a lot of jobs that have been all men but me, and that's been a positive thing. A guy who's a chauvinist, I'm not interested in. Any good man knows women are much smarter than men."" She laughs. ""Of course, we live in a world where things like this happen: A friend of mine went to her dermatologist to check on a mole, and the doctor said, 'Your face is very expressive. Let me know if you want me to do anything about that.' Isn't that hysterical--and awful?""<br /><br />Gugino opts for beauty through health: sleep, exercise, eating right. Throughout brunch, she pops vitamins a few at a time. ""My other nickname is Doctor Gugino,"" she says. ""When my friends have a health concern, they call me. I've always been a vitamin taker. I also take digestive enzymes and antioxidants, and supplements that help with the thyroid and adrenals for my time-zone changes.""<br /><br />Speaking of time, Gugino has to run; she's got tickets to a play. But Mama Gugino has one last piece of advice: ""Early on I thought I had to have the answers,"" she says. ""Now I just want to ask questions, and find out where that will take me.""<br /><br /><b>See Carla's cover shoot</b><br /><br /><br /><b>See Carla's favorite beauty products</b><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty-and-style/carla-guginos-favorite-beauty-products""><br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/files/images/buttons/slideshow_bttn.gif"" /><br /><br /></a><br /><br />",Go Green
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/michelle-monaghan-video,Life,29,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,,Michelle Monaghan: Life Is Beautiful,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/1012-michelle.jpg,"<p>A starring role opposite Robert Downey Jr.-it's an opportunity any young actress would kill for. But Michelle Monaghan almost passed up what would come to be her big-screen break: Right before her audition for the 2005 movie <i>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</i>, she got a serious case of cold feet. ""I thought, <i>There is no way I can do this!</i>"" she remembers. ""I was literally calling up my agent to cancel the audition, but thought, <i>You're going in and you're going to do this</i>. And as the phone was ringing, I hung up."" She thinks back to the moment and says, ""Whenever something really scares the shit out of me, I know that it's the right thing for me to do."" </p><p>Needless to say, she got the part. Michelle's critically acclaimed performance led to roles in films such as <i>Gone Baby Gone, Made of Honor</i>, and <i>Eagle Eye</i>-and then right back into the arms of Robert Downey Jr. in the new screwball comedy Due Date, which also stars funnyman Zach Galifianakis. Her Sofia Coppola-directed drama <i>Somewhere</i>, which won a prestigious Golden Lion for Best Film at the Venice International Film Festival in September, hits theaters in a few weeks. </p><p><b>Check out scenes from Michelle's cover shoot:</b><br /></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Keeping It Real</b><br /><br />Hiking through an L.A. canyon with her, though, you can easily forget you're in the company of a woman who stars in movies for a living. Dressed in a black tank and black capris, a red bandana tied around her head, she has an everygirl quality about her-an innocent, fresh-faced essence that is fitting when you find out she hails from Winthrop, Iowa (population: 772). </p><p>Most celebrities, even the friendliest, have a bit of reserve, which is understandable when your fashion sense is scrutinized on a daily basis and the paparazzi stalk you in the grocery store. But Michelle dispenses with boundaries during our climb; she offers up half of her banana and has an endearing habit of touching your arm when making a point or enthusing over something. Then there's her liberal use of a four letter word: gosh. As in, ""You're this young woman from small-town Iowa, and suddenly you're kissing movie stars. Gosh, it's a tough job!"" </p><p>Offscreen, the smooching is limited to husband Peter White, an Australian graphic designer she met 10 years ago while having drinks with friends at a New York City bar. ""He had blue eyes and a Mohawk,""she says. ""It did something for me."" She worked up the guts to ask him out for the next day...and they've been together ever since. The pair married in 2005 in a little seaside church in Port Douglas, Australia. Three years later, their daughter, Willow, was born. </p><p>Like any working mom, Michelle has to employ a skillful bit of juggling. ""On my kitchen counter sits a KitchenAid mixer, a potty seat,and a small pile of scripts,"" she says. ""That pretty much sums it up. I'm a homemaker, a potty trainer, and a part-time pretender."" Actor and screenwriter friend Paul Leyden, who served as best man at Michelle and Peter's wedding, attributes her down-to-earth attitude to her upbringing. Her mom, Sharon, ran an in-home day care for 40years, and her dad, Robert, is a retired factory worker and part time farmer. The family took in foster kids-about 14 all told-over the years. ""That Winthrop air will always be running through her blood,"" says Paul. ""She loves the simple things-her family, a couple of beers, hanging out with friends."" </p><p>Michelle and Peter often entertain in their Hollywood Hills home (fun bit of trivia: It was once owned by screen legend Ginger Rogers), whipping up meals using the tomatoes, artichokes, and zucchini that she grows in her little vegetable garden out back.<br /></p><p></p><p><b>A Healthy Attitude</b><br /><br />Her eating habits, she admits, weren't always quite so virtuous. Pre-Willow, Michelle was a regular at McDonald's, usually ordering a number three (for those unfamiliar with the Mickey D's menu, that means a Quarter Pounder with cheese, fries, and a soft drink). ""Only I'd swap the Coke for a caramel sundae with nuts!"" she says. But being pregnant changed all that. ""For the first time, I thought about my well-being. Now I'm trying to instill healthy eating habits in my daughter, so by default my husband and I are eating healthier."" </p><p>These days, Michelle is more into green markets than the Golden Arches. For lunch, she's big on salads (""I never ate them before I got pregnant; now I eat them three or four times a week""), turkey sandwiches with avocado and a slice of Swiss cheese, and homemade soup (""broccoli, cauliflower, butternut squash-make a big batch and you have it for days""), and for dinner she likes to have fish (she loves trout and salmon) with steamed or roasted veggies or brown rice. But rest assured: ""Good ol' Iowa ribeye"" is still on the menu every now and then. ""I've never been on a diet,"" she says. ""I don't think they make sense. Ultimately, it's eating sensibly...but if I'm at a restaurant, all bets are off!"" </p><p>Giving birth also spurred her to get into shape. A few months after Willow was born, Michelle started working with trainer Kiki Aldonas at Equinox gym to lose the baby weight. They still meet three days a week for hour-long sessions that include lots of cable work, squats, lunges, and step-ups. If Michelle can't get to the gym, she'll take the occasional yoga class, and when she's traveling, she'll bang out 30 minutes of interval training on a hotel treadmill. ""It's a push to make myself go-it's hard!"" she says. ""But whenever I get off my lazy butt, I'm happy I did.""</p><p>The key to staying motivated, says Michelle, is turning exercise into a social activity. ""Going on a hike with a friend or my husband works for me because it doesn't feel like exercise,"" she says. ""You're catching up or having a gossip session, and time goes by quickly. This weekend my husband and I played beach volleyball with friends and worked up the greatest sweat.""</p><p>And then there's her growing passion for surfing. Having just wrapped two movies (the sci-fi thriller <i>Source Code</i>, costarring Jake Gyllenhaal, and the drama <i>Machine Gun Preacher</i>, with Gerard Butler) due out next year, the busy actress finally has time to sneak down to San Diego with Peter and Willow for a three-day surf trip. The funny thing is, says Michelle, ""I never thought I'd be able to surf, because I'm kind of scared of water."" Just one more leap of faith in a life that has been full of them.<br /></p><p></p><p>Michelle's Six Best Hot-Body Secrets<br />The newly minted health and fitness devotee and her trainer, Kiki Aldonas, offer shape-up tricks.</p><p>> Bring up the rear.<br />When Michelle started working with Aldonas,she wanted to build a bit of butt. ""We do squats and all kinds of lunges:reverse, diagonal, and crossovers-anything where she can feel asolid contraction,"" says Aldonas. ""The crossover step-up is great for that.""</p><p>> Pull some strings.<br />To tone her upper body, ""we use cables to do lateral pulldowns, chest presses, and French curls,"" says Aldonas.""Woodchoppers are particularly great for the core because you get a good ab contraction. We do 15 reps on each side, using 10- to almost 20-pound weights. Some people think you need to do a lot of reps at a very low weight for your abs, but I find that the opposite gets better results."" </p><p>> Limber up. <br />Michelle stretches in the morning and then again at night. The drill: ""I stretch my inner thighs, quads, hamstrings, calves,arms, chest, and back, and hold each stretch for about 10 seconds,""she says. ""It's amazing how good it makes me feel, especially in the morning, when I'm a little sluggish."" </p><p>> Get juiced. <br />""I try to drink green juice three times a week- kale, celery, spinach. Sometimes that replaces my coffee,"" she says. ""I also bought a Vitamix blender. It purees everything.""</p><p>> Fuel up in the a.m.</p><p>""Breakfast is my fuel for the day,"" says Michelle.""It might be a bowl of goat's-milk yogurt with granola, berries,and raisins, and maybe shaved almonds and flaxseed thrown in, and a banana smoothie."" </p><p>> Grab and go. <br />""I keep cherries, raspberries, and blueberries,in the fridge so I can just eat them by the handful,"" says Michelle.</p>",healthy eating
http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/foods-to-reduce-salt-intake,Nutrition,8,4,2,2,0,2,0,0,,Salt Intake: Learn How to Lower It ,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0608-shaker-heights-0956.jpg,"Even if you avoid known salt bombs like chips, <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/fast-food"">fast food</a>, canned soup, and salted nuts, you could still end up swimming in sodium. Women eat more than twice the recommended <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/weight-loss-success-story-15"">salt intake</a> per day-- around 2,400, which helps explain why 30 percent of younger women are at risk for hypertension. ""You may not be tasting salt, but it's there,"" says Edward J. Roccella, Ph.D., coordinator of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.<br /><br />Only 20 percent of your sodium intake comes from what you sprinkle on your food at the last minute, so cutting back on products that are high in sodium to begin with is key. Here are four surprising salt mines that flood your sodium intake.<br /><br /><b>1. ""Healthy"" Meals</b> To replace taste sacrificed to the low-cal gods, manufacturers often add too much salt. Kraft South Beach Diet Deli Ham & Turkey Wraps have 1,430 milligrams, and Quaker instant oatmeal has 270 mg. Even a cup of cottage cheese can have 900 mg. <br /><br /><b>2. Cheese</b> Parmesan packs almost 1,600 mg a serving, while American cheese can have 800 mg per regular 1-ounce slice - and 1,600 per low-fat slice. Swiss is lowest, with about 50 mg. <br /><br /><b>3. Canned Vegetables</b> Who knew eating vegetables could get you in trouble? Salt is often used as a preservative in canned produce, and canned green beans contain more than 400 mg per half cup. If you need your vegetables to stay fresh long term, opt for frozen.<br /><br /><b>4. Breads And <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/premium-packaged-foods"">Cold Cereals</a></b> A slice of Sara Lee Heart Healthy Multi-Grain bread has 190 mg. Check out cereals, too, before you buy: Cheerios have 210 mg of sodium per cup - 30 more than 20 Lay's potato chips. Two Eggo NutriGrain waffles have 420 mg. <br /><br />Once you've sidelined the worst sodium sinners, learn to love low-salt foods. It will take your palate about 2 weeks to adjust, then you won't notice a difference, says Cindy Moore, R.D., director of nutrition therapy at the Cleveland Clinic. To compensate for missing salt, find flavor elsewhere - specifically, herbs and spices. (Beware of herb-based prepared seasonings, though; many are loaded with salt.) Basil goes best with chicken or beef, dill works well with chicken and fish, and tarragon tastes great with any kind of meat. In terms of spices, cardamom is best with meats, fish, and poultry, while cinnamon is good with chicken.<br />","healthy eating,cooking"

Now what? WH explains how to <a href=""http://recipes.womenshealthmag.com/homepage.aspx"">cook fish</a> the easy, healthy way. <br /><br />Repeat after me: Deep frying is evil! Your two healthiest cooking options are pan roasting and baking. Rebecca Charles, chef and owner of Pearl Oyster Bar in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, and chef Kyle Shadix, R.D., a nutritionist and culinary consultant in New York City, offer these tips for <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/experts/nutrition-and-cooking-tips"">cooking fish</a> and getting perfect results.<br /><br /><b>Pan Roasting </b><br /><br />Because pan roasting requires flipping a filet, it's best for firm varieties such as sole or trout; more fragile species like cod or bass tend to fall apart. ""When you pan roast, you get a perfect golden brown crust,"" Charles says. You need just two pieces of equipment to achieve this tasty effect: a long spatula to flip the fish and a sautee pan big enough for your filets. Charles recommends soaking white fish filets like cod or sole in milk for 5 to 10 minutes before pan roasting, especially if you're not a huge fish fan. ""The milk will draw out any strong, unpleasant flavors and give the fish an added sweetness,"" she says. Toss in a pan with half a tablespoon of a trans fat-free oil like canola and cook on medium heat for 3 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Flip the filet just once to keep it from breaking up.<br /><br /><b>Baking </b><br /><br />Oven cooking works well for just about any kind of fish. Shadix's rule of thumb: Bake at 400 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes per inch of thickness. Cooking fish at high temperatures for short periods will prevent juices from evaporating and keep it from drying out. Rather than drowning fish in butter, spray it with cooking oil or drizzle with olive oil; tuck it into a pouch you've made from tinfoil along with some finely cut vegetables like leeks and carrots, plus lemons and/or herbs; and bake. For a <a href=""http://recipes.womenshealthmag.com/Recipe/penne-with-salmon-and-roasted-vegetables.aspx"">healthy fish</a> with Mediterranean flavor, rub pressed garlic into the fish, then top with fresh tomatoes, scallions, and a sprinkle of tangy cheese such as Parmesan or Romano. Or go Moroccan: Place the fish on foil, rub with cinnamon and curry, and top with chopped onion and fresh cilantro.<br />","healthy eating,cooking"

A<a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness-5""> strong core</a> reduces the likelihood of lower back and hamstring problems, helps in day-to-day activities like lifting a toddler, and in yoga class it ""will help you maintain your balance for longer periods of time and help you get in and out of the moves more easily,"" says Dr. Michele Olson, professor of exercise science at Auburn University in Montgomery, Alabama. <br /><br />The trick is targeting all of the crucial muscles around your middle. Welcome to Abs 101. The core is made up of around 30 muscles that connect your legs to your hips, spine, and rib cage and keep your torso stable. The mover and shakers include the obliques, the ""side"" muscles that rotate your torso; the rectus abdominis (RA), the contours of which form the famously drool-worthy ""six-pack"" and whose main function is to flex the trunk; the deep transverse abdominis (TVA) that acts like a corset around your midsection; as well as the stabilizing muscles of the hip and lower back. To cultivate a strong core and eye-popping abs, Hilary Lindsay of Active Yoga in Nashville developed this core-on-the-floor sequence that hits every major abdominal muscle. ""These movements are hands down more effective [than traditional crunches],"" Dr. Olson says.

Cars whiz by. She looks left, then right, then suddenly shouts over her shoulder: ""OK! Here we go!"" Great. An actress with a God complex. Then again, she does play a doctor on TV, and in a pinch, she probably could perform CPR. Or stanch a gushing head wound.</p><p>Well, maybe not. ""Hmm. I don't know if I could save you. But I am fascinated with neurology, so I know a lot about the brain,"" says Wilde, better known as Thirteen, the bisexual M.D. with a terminal brain disorder on Fox's hit series <i>House.</i> (""Not only am I dying, but I'm gay. Now, that's a juicy role,"" she says.) Her job leads her to self-diagnose every bump and itch she gets: ""Yesterday I was dehydrated and my fingers were twitching, so I thought, 'I have ALS and I probably have three years to live.' I freaked out.""</p><p>Thankfully, Wilde recovered. So much so that she suggested this leisurely if slightly treacherous ride to the Santa Monica <a href=""/life/change-the-world-with-the-food-you-eat"">farmers' market</a> for an al fresco lunch. For the self-described ""sort-of vegetarian who eats fish,"" the lure is a raw-food stand and a chance to plop down and wiggle her toes in a patch of grass. ""You're not going to believe this, but they have bike valets there,"" she says. ""Only in Los Angeles, right? So crazy.""</p><p>The same could be said for Wilde's rapid ascent from casting assistant to TV star. Since arriving here in 2002, the 24-year-old Irish-American has shape-shifted from a blonde nympho in the indie fave <i>Alpha Dog</i> to a sultry brunette in the slasher flick <i>Turistas.</i> (""Brunettes have more fun,"" she says, ""because people don't know what to expect from them."") She also just finished shooting a goofy period comedy called <i>The Year One</i> in Shreveport, Louisiana, alongside Jack Black, Michael Cera, and David Cross. ""It was freaking cold at times, and there were a lot of unpleasant conditions,"" she says, ""but I was surrounded by the funniest human beings I have ever met. There was zero drama.""</p><p>Her series of Sapphic smooches with Mischa Barton in the second season of The O.C. launched this Washington, DC, native into the role of male fantasy fodder. (The steamy kisses have garnered 100,000-plus YouTube hits, and she says she still gets letters from sexually confusedyoung women who consider Wilde a role model.) ""When I kiss a girl for a part, people think it's sexy. But if two guys kiss, suddenly there's a backlash. It's a double standard,"" she says, munching on a guacamole pesto taco. ""Honestly, I think we're all bisexual in some way.""</p><p>And who would top Wilde's own girl-on-girl tryst list? ""Angelina Jolie, hands down! Just seeing an actress who has been through it all and who doesn't care what other people say about her--someone who has forged her own path,"" she says. Wilde met her crush at last year's Golden Globes, where Jolie was up for her role as Mariane Pearl in <i>A Mighty Heart:</i> ""I was sitting at her knees and talking about my parents [well-known international journalists Leslie and Andrew Cockburn] and how dangerous being a journalist in a foreign country can be,"" she says. ""Later, I was like, 'Brad who?' I didn't even realize he was leaning over her shoulder the whole time. Everyone around her just disappeared.""</p><p>One guy Wilde has found impossible to ignore is her husband, Tao Ruspoli. Several years ago, she was feeling a bit turned off by L.A. guys--""they spend way more time looking in the mirror than I ever do,"" she says--when a friend of her parents suggested a set-up. She bristled. ""He wanted to introduce me to this Italian guy who made films and lived on a school bus. I said, 'Whoa! I don't want to meet a dude who lives on a bus!'"" Turns out the guy was an Italian prince whose family owns a palazzo in Rome and a castle in Vignanello, Italy. He's a filmmaker and documentarian; the bus is a mobile studio for a cinema collective he founded.</p><p>Within six months, the two had eloped--on the bus, no less. (They later had a proper wedding in Virginia.) Ruspoli was 27; Wilde, just 18. ""My dad did have a minor heart attack, and it was hard to imagine settling down at the time,"" she recalls. ""But there was this wave of romantic excitement and an overwhelming sense that we were supposed to be family. We were very open to the idea that if it didn't work, we would let it go its course. No pressure."" (A quick glance at her ring finger reveals a chunky gold band, not the honking emerald-cut rock favored by Hollywood royalty.) Wilde gets a kick out of people's first reaction to her titled spouse. ""Everyone expects him to pick me up in a limo or a yacht,"" she says. ""Then Tao rolls up in this old Thunderbird, wearing flip-flops, his hair all crazy. People are like, 'He's a prince?'"" </p><p>The two certainly don't live like nobility. Their bohemian Venice Beach loft is crammed with oversize abstract art, ethnic furniture, and cookbooks scarred with food stains. ""I used to play hooky from school so I could watch cooking shows,"" says Wilde, who loves to throw impromptu dinner parties. She tries to be relaxed about her eating, but she avoids bread and pasta as much as possible--not always easy when you're married to an Italian. Cheese and good wine, however, are daily staples. ""I don't own a scale, and Tao banned the word fat from our house,"" she says. ""If we eat too much, we say, 'I feel clogged up.'""</p><p>Wilde--who actually has won a few eating contests in her day--knows that feeling well. ""Once, in Australia, I ate 33 pancakes in 20 minutes, and I only did it because they said a girl could never enter the competition,"" she says proudly. ""I won against these giant men, and they were convinced I was cheating. Guys have some sort of sick fascination with girls who can eat."" Conversely, Wilde says, women seem to get off on women who don't eat. A year ago, during a visit to Thailand with her husband, she caught a nasty case of Dengue fever and lost about 15 pounds. ""I looked really thin, and all the men in my life were worried about me,"" she says. ""But all the women in my life were proud of me. They started calling it 'the Dengue diet.'""</p><p>To work off the occasional pound or three of pancakes, Wilde exercises daily. She spins at a local studio (a fact she's embarrassed to admit, since she's just blocks from the beach). ""I make fun of it, but it's amazing, because you have to push yourself through this resistance, which is so therapeutic,"" she says. ""And they say you can burn nearly 800 calories in, like, 45 minutes if you push it to the highest level."" She also does yoga, dabbles in karate, and hikes regularly with her dogs: a bulldog named Lola that she lovingly refers to as ""a side of ham"" and a fluffy mutt that goes by Paco. In 2006 Paco won a contest to be the ""spokesdog"" for Old Navy. He traveled, sat for photo shoots, and got paid (his salary went to a canine charity). ""He still acts like a doggie model sometimes. If I put a T-shirt on him, he won't move. He thinks he's back at the job; he'll strike a pose and just sit there."" </p><p>As for herself, she'll pass on posing for hours on end. ""It would be so depressing to be a model and not get to say a word,"" she says. ""There's no personality involved."" Even perfecting a paparazzi-worthy smile for the red carpet has been a challenge. ""I got a tip, which sounds ridiculous but actually works,"" she says. She suddenly flinches, like she's in extreme pain, and says ""Ouf!"" Is it appendicitis, doc? Another bout of Dengue fever?Nope. ""You have to smile like someone just punched you in the stomach. Bam! Smile! Bam! Smile!"" </p><p><b>Pop Quiz</b></p><p><b>Best advice from Mom</b><br />""Never believe anyone who tells you that you can't do what you want to do.""</p><p><b>Strangest thing in her fridge</b><br />""Kombucha. People think it looks like vomit, but I think it's fermented mushrooms, and it's good for you.""</p><p><b>One thing that people would be surprised to hear about her</b><br />""I'm shy. In fact, I was at a party last night and I was just sitting there praying that no one would come over and talk to me.""</p><p><b>Most embarrassing thing she listens to</b><br />""In my car, I have The Tempest on tape and it always comes on suddenly and really loud.""</p><p><b>Best beauty tip ever</b><br />""Wear mascara.

Cameron, her cheeks a seashell pink, her big hazel eyes wide and bright and smiling, doesn't look sick or act it. Indeed, she seems extraordinarily fit and healthy. And cheerful. No one could guess that the white box hidden behind the milk contains the medication that may - or may not - prevent her from becoming a complete invalid one day. Or that the 34-year-old Atlanta native wakes up every morning wondering what will happen to her if the medicine doesn't work and she ends up in a wheelchair, blind, or unable to think as clearly as she does today. But Cameron is tough and buoyant. And she tries to overcome her fear with the same iron will she harnesses to defeat the disease, <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/multiple-sclerosis-information"">multiple sclerosis</a>, that 5 years ago turned her life upside down.<br /><br />Syringe in hand, she sits atop a wooden kitchen stool, lifts her lavender miniskirt, and aims an inch-long needle into her upper thigh. ""Okay, okay, you can do this,"" she pants, her breath growing more shallow, her calm veneer melting in the Atlanta heat. ""God, I hate this,"" she says, her entire body shaking, the needle finally breaking the skin and diving down deep into her quadriceps, where the medicine is released. <br /><br />Within an hour Cameron's head pounds ""like there's an ice pick inside of it."" Later, her legs and back begin to ache, and she grows nauseated - all side effects that are as much a part of her treatment as the medication itself. Regardless, Cameron continues the conversation as though she's completely fine. She walks Rose, her Irish setter, in the late morning drizzle. She talks animatedly through a lunch of shrimp risotto while staying in touch with her office through her BlackBerry. ""As bad as I can feel sometimes, I try as hard as I can not to let MS interrupt my life,"" she says. <br /><br />Cameron endures this ordeal once a week when she injects herself with Avonex, one of a handful of FDA-approved medications that clinical trials show can - but don't always - slow the progression of MS's debilitating symptoms and reduce the incidence of relapse. No one knows how it works. What is known is that it can cause severe liver damage, lower the body's ability to battle infection, incite seizures, and lead to congestive heart failure. ""I don't know which is worse,"" Cameron ponders, ""my MS or the medicine I have to take that may or may not make it better."" <br /><br />Cameron is not the only woman facing this dilemma, of course. According to the National MS Society, 400,000 Americans now suffer from multiple sclerosis, with 10,000 new cases diagnosed each year. For reasons researchers are only beginning to understand, MS, a degenerative autoimmune disease that attacks the central nervous system, is at least twice as common in women as in men, and 90 percent of those it afflicts for the first time are under the age of 50. Even more frightening, it strikes suddenly and, with no cure, often leaves its victims physically, mentally, and emotionally devastated. ""It totally sucks,"" Cameron says, her eyes welling with tears, a smile still on her lips.<br /><br />Just 5 years ago Cameron was 29 and living almost a clich of the perfect life. She was married to her college sweetheart, living in a nice house, working hard at a good job, and hanging out regularly with friends. A self-described type A personality, Cameron often lived a full week in a single day, working full time, earning her MBA in the evenings, and yet always finding time for a round or two of golf. Both Cameron and her husband were ambitious, driven people who worked long hours, and, after a while, their marriage started to wilt from lack of attention and broken communication. But as she would with any other problem, Cameron tackled her marital troubles head on and brought her husband into couples counseling. ""I fully expected everything to work out and that one day we would have the white picket fence and 2.5 kids,"" she says. ""Failure simply wasn't something I ever considered."" <br /><br />That is, until her body failed her. Every hour in the United States, someone is diagnosed with MS. For Cameron that hour arrived late in the afternoon of September 23, 2000, a day after she awoke to play golf with some coworkers but instead got out of bed and collapsed to the floor, her left side paralyzed. Sensation returned within a few minutes, and she figured she'd pinched a nerve in kickboxing class the night before. But when her left side again went numb the next day, she says, ""I thought I was having a stroke."" An MRI revealed something else: seven lesions on her cerebral hemisphere, some that indicated the disease had been there - but asymptomatic - for several years, and some that were new and causing her central nervous system to backfire. When the on-call neurologist at the Northside Hospital emergency room delivered the news to her and her husband, Cameron remembers, ""My head spun around my neck like a cartoon character, and the blood completely drained from my face."" <br /><br />She didn't even know what multiple sclerosis was and confused it with muscular dystrophy, a degenerative disease of the skeletal muscles. ""I really had no idea what was wrong with me,"" she says. ""I only knew that it couldn't be good.""<br /><br />MS causes the body's immune system to attack myelin, the protective insulation surrounding the nerve fibers of the central nervous system, and replaces it with hard ""sclerotic"" tissue - those lesions in Cameron's brain. Sometimes it attacks the nerves themselves, causing paralysis, blindness, and cognitive impairment. Like heart disease or diabetes, it's an illness that doctors seek to control rather than to cure. And its symptoms are as individual as the person who has them; some feel strange sensations in their limbs, others don't feel their limbs at all. Some feel debilitating pain, others don't even know they have the disease - it all depends on where in the brain or along the spine the MS chooses to strike. And the truly weird thing is that symptoms can last a day, a week, a month, or years, and then as though by a miracle, disappear only to return weeks or months or years later. ""It's crazy-making,"" Cameron says. ""When I wake up I just don't know what my day will bring. I might feel fine, but an hour later I might not feel my leg.""<br /><br />But for Cameron and many other victims, the impact of the disease stretches far beyond the physical. Four months after she was diagnosed, her husband announced he was leaving her. Her disease, she says tearfully, finished them off. ""I got very dark,"" she says, ""and I couldn't focus on fixing our marriage when I was trying to understand who I was with MS."" Her faith in God slipping away, Cameron stopped going to church. ""My parents were like, 'Where is the sweet little Christian girl we raised?' I told them, 'She died when I got MS.'""<br /><br />And then in a way she was reborn. ""I got to the point where I just didn't want to feel bad anymore,"" Cameron says. ""I was so tired of scanning my body for symptoms and living in fear of relapses that I decided to start enjoying myself more."" Cameron even started making a ""party"" of her weekly Avonex shots; every Sunday night she'd play tennis with her friends, who would give her the shot, then take her out for Mexican food and margaritas. ""I knew I'd be sick the whole next day anyway, so why not have a little fun?""<br /><br />It's not that Cameron ignores her symptoms; she just tries to keep them in perspective. And she knows what will aggravate them. That's why she limits her outdoor sports in the summertime - heat fatigues her to the extreme - and plans evenings out only when she knows she has an easy day at the office (though she still works 50 to 60 hours a week). ""I have a limited amount of energy, and I am learning how to expend it efficiently,"" she says. <br /><br />Like many with MS, Cameron lives by a 24-hour rule. When she experiences a new numbness, weakness, or extreme fatigue, she waits it out for a day or so. If the feelings remain, she knows she may be relapsing, and calls her doctor. That happened in November 2001, when her right side showed signs of paralysis while she was at work. ""I couldn't hold a cup of coffee with one hand,"" she says. ""And I couldn't write; my fingers simply wouldn't move the pen around."" <br /><br />A relapse was confirmed, and Cameron underwent a 3-day regimen of intensive IV steroids - the same treatment she had in the hospital after her initial diagnosis. Just as before, the steroids caused her to grow bloated, irritable, and anxious. Relapses are so fear-inducing because, while patients generally recuperate, the recovery is rarely complete. ""My penmanship still isn't what it used to be,"" says Cameron, who used to do calligraphy as a hobby.<br /><br />Cameron is a director of strategic planning for Bell South, the perfect job for her Control Everything Before It Happens personality. Her disease is the one thing in her life that she can't dominate, but, boy, does she try. After reading an article about how mercury might exacerbate MS, she had her dentist replace all of her silver fillings with porcelain. And she's changed her meat- and cheese- loving diet to all things organic - fruits, grains, and vegetables grown without pesticides, and hormone-free meat (when she eats it at all). ""In a way I've never been healthier in my life,"" she says. <br /><br />That said, barely a day will pass without an uninvited appearance of one of MS's telltale symptoms, such as a sudden numbness in her leg that makes her trip, or the need to go to the toilet but the inability to urinate. ""It can just take a while before my brain responds to what my body tells it to do."" <br /><br />In some ways Cameron is fortunate. Lesions haven't yet formed lower in her brain or along her spine, which could further compromise her ability to function below the waist. And since the disease's degenerative pattern can generally be predicted within the first 5 to 10 years of diagnosis, she has reason to hope that she won't get much worse. ""She's in an ideal position to do very well,"" says William Stuart, M.D., director of the MS Center of Atlanta and Cameron's doctor. ""We caught the disease in its first episode, which we aren't always able to do with MS patients, and the medication appears to be successful in staving off further damage."" <br /><br />Still, the existing damage to Cameron's brain is permanent, and she will always suffer from symptoms of the disease. <br /><br />After her marriage ended, one of Cameron's biggest fears was that she would have to face the future by herself. ""Who was going to want someone with this disease, someone who might only have a few good years left?"" she remembers thinking. <br /><br />But along came Brent Mlott, 40, a handsome Bell South coworker who had known of Cameron's illness since shortly after it was diagnosed. When they began dating 3 years ago, Cameron resisted complaining about her symptoms for fear Mlott would see her as a negative person. But it was her very ability to overcome the daily fallout of her disease - the fact that she showed up to work early in the morning, stayed until late at night, took on every project offered to her, and laughed her way through her fear and vulnerability - that attracted him to her in the first place. Not only did he want to hear about her anguish, he wanted to help her through it. ""If it was going to be a part of her life, it was going to be a part of mine,"" he says. <br /><br />He hasn't always found that easy. For every night she has the energy to go to dinner with friends or walk hand in hand with him through an art museum, there's another night when she's just too exhausted to socialize. And even though they love traveling together, planning vacations around her weekly injections can be problematic because the medication always needs to be refrigerated, and so they can't travel too far for too long. <br /><br />And yet, Cameron is so active and energetic that Mlott often forgets about her MS entirely. On a recent vacation to a Tennessee horse farm, the two were jogging together when Cameron suddenly eased her pace. ""I ran back and jogged circles around her and teased her for slowing down until I noticed that her left leg was dragging a bit and she was having some symptoms,"" he says. <br /><br />Still, Mlott admits that he fears seeing Cameron decline, a feeling exacer-bated by his mother's stroke several years ago, which left her unable to walk, talk, or care for herself in any meaningful way. ""My father worked his whole life, raised two sons, put them through college, and in his retirement has to care for my mother 24/7,"" he says. ""I didn't want that for my life."" Mlott's periodic visits to his parents in Charleston, South Carolina, aggravated his fears. ""I would have proposed to Cameron 6 months earlier if not for the internal struggle I was battling.""<br /><br />But whenever he returned to Atlanta, seeing her smiling face erased all his fears. ""I got to the point where I didn't want to miss out on 20 or 30 great years because of what may or may not happen to her,"" he says.<br /><br />Finally, Mlott proposed, and the two will wed in February. Because both were married before, it will be a very small wedding. Indeed, it will be just the two of them in some faraway exotic locale yet to be decided upon. ""I want our wedding to set the stage for the kind of adventures we hope to have for the rest of our lives together,"" Cameron says. <br /><br />And if Cameron does end up in a wheelchair some day, Mlott says, ""I'll be there to push it.""<br /><br /><b>What You Can Do About It</b><br /><br />The National MS Society is the world's largest private sponsor of multiple sclerosis research, spending $35 million per year on attempts to find the cause of the disease, better treatments, and a cure. You can raise awareness of MS by wearing one of its ""Hope"" wristbands, or support its efforts directly by becoming a member. But there are other, more active ways you can help.<br /><br /><b>Walk, ride, or hike.</b> The society sponsors three different types of fund-raising events that anyone can get involved in: the MS Walk, the MS Bike Tour, and the MS Challenge Walk (a 3-day, 50-mile trek). To find an event near you or to learn how you can sponsor a participant in an event if you can't take part yourself, go to nationalmssociety.org.<br /><br /><b>Sell stuff on eBay.</b> You can now sell items on eBay and have from 10 percent to 100 percent of the proceeds go to the National MS Society. Go to givingworks.ebay.com for details.<br /><br /><b>Become an advocate.</b>The MS Action Network lobbies local, state, and federal government officials on issues affecting people with MS. One of the most pressing matters currently is the Respite Care Act, a bill introduced in Congress with bipartisan support that would provide relief for caregivers of people with MS.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/mandy-moore-interview,Life,1,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,,Interview with Singer-Actress Mandy Moore,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0907-mandy-moore.jpg,"<p>""It's a baby sperm,"" says Mandy, unzipping a motorcycle boot and slipping off her sock to expose a small black <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/tattoo-interpretation"">tattoo</a> near the arch of her right foot. It sure is, though honestly, it could also pass for a kid's balloon. She lets loose a laugh as she recalls the day, two years ago, when she trekked to an Omaha tattoo parlor with her five band members during her last tour. ""We were goofing off, writing a song about babies or something,"" she says. ""Somehow that evolved into everybody getting inked."" </p><p>Mandy reveals her proclivity for tats-she also has a heart on the top of one toe-during a Friday afternoon visit to the Getty Center, a breathtaking mecca of art, architecture, and landscaping in Los Angeles' Santa Monica Mountains. The singer-actress has spent the better part of an hour perusing a collection of photographs, and, settling onto a bench overlooking a maze of red azaleas, she explains that she's well aware that the image most people have of Mandy Moore doesn't include <a href=""/health-3"">body art</a>. ""I understand people have preconceived notions of who I am or what I do,"" she says, referring to her origins as a 15-year-old bubblegum-pop pixie who burst onto the scene 10 years ago cooing a light-as-air concoction called ""Candy"" and her most recent incarnation, as a fresh-faced ingénue in a string of films such as <i>License to Wed</i> and <i>Because I Said So</i>. ""But I do find it a bit bizarre that people find it bizarre that I've grown up."" </p><p>Which, of course, she has. Now 25, the Orlando native looks more indie rock than polished pop, in black Wayfarers, a long, slouchy cardigan, a scarf draped around her neck, and skinny jeans. (Her hair, dyed a warm chestnut brown after a ""hot second"" as a blonde, is pulled back into a bumpy ponytail. ""My hair's naturally dirty-dishwater light brown,"" she says. ""Ug-ly."") Her music has evolved, too. Amanda Leigh (the title is her given name), Mandy's recently released sixth album, is chock-full of introspective odes to self-discovery and the roller-coaster ride of relationships. Fortunately, Mandy's own love life is now firmly on track. But her <a href=""/sex-and-relationships/woman-who-cheat"">marriage</a> in March to singer-songwriter Ryan Adams has garnered unwelcome attention-earlier in the day, Mandy and her new husband were accompanied on their hike by paparazzi. ""It was like 9 in the morning, I'm having my period, I have a huge pimple on my face, and all of a sudden some guy pops out from behind a porta-potty,"" Mandy says, not bothering to disguise her annoyance. She didn't then, either: ""I said, 'Man, this is a private street.' He goes, 'I'm sorry.' I was like, 'No, you're not. If you were, you wouldn't be here.'"" </p><p>Mandy may not be shy about calling out an overly aggressive snapper, but even after a decade in the spotlight, she remains accessible. She offers up a ""bless you"" when a stranger across the gallery sneezes and eagerly obliges when a tourist-mistaking her for just another young Angeleno-asks her to snap his photo in front of a fountain (""I'll take another, just in case,"" she says). And after a fierce wind sends this writer's drink sailing all over Mandy's See by Chloe bag, she barely bothers to brush it off. ""Are you kidding me?"" she says. ""It's just iced tea."" </p><p>And it's that duality-sweet yet strong-that Mandy's closest friends admire. ""She can say 'good gracious' and 'fuck' in the same sentence, and they both sound convincing,"" says singer-songwriter Rachael Yamagata, who co-wrote a song for Mandy's last record. ""She has this beautiful purity and this up-for-anything edge. She really is otherworldly in that way.""</p><p>Mandy was decidedly down-to-earth during the making of her latest album. Instead of renting a recording studio, she and co-writer/producer Mike Viola moved into sound engineer Ducky Carlisle's modest home outside Boston and laid down tracks in the basement. Mandy often recorded in her flannel PJ's, with a candle burning nearby. ""I'd never sung sitting down before,"" she says, ""but there was something so intimate about the way we were doing the record. It was just the three of us, and we made the most of what we had. Typically, in a studio, every day you're conscious of how much money it's costing, but there was no pressure. It was like, let's go for this song today, and if it wasn't working, we'd come back to it later.""</p><p>Jon Leshay, who's managed Mandy since the beginning of her career, says that Amanda Leigh marks an important turning point in her career. ""Mandy's a perfectionist, ridiculously hard on herself,"" he says. ""But with this record, she was able to let go. She just let things be, rather than go over them 800 times. I think she realized there's a particular kind of beauty in that.""</p><p>Spend an afternoon with Mandy and it becomes clear that she's feeling a newfound, hard-won fulfillment not only professionally but personally. She's understandably protective of her marriage (""the more you give away, the less that's there for you""), but in the end, she can't help gushing. Mandy calls Ryan ""my best friend, someone I have so much respect for."" The pair were wed in a Savannah chapel after a month-long engagement, with no family or friends in attendance. ""We figured, 'Yeah, why not? Let's do it,'"" she says. ""It was never important for a wedding to be about anything other than me and my partner. A big celebration was never my cup of tea."" </p><p>The nuptials were pulled together so quickly that there wasn't time to size her wedding ring. She still hasn't gotten around to it. The two delicate eternity bands on her ring finger are part of her engagement set; they're a smidge big, too, which is why she rarely wears them at home. ""I'm so klutzy,"" she says. ""I'm constantly worried that they're gonna fall off.""</p><p>Truth be told, not long ago, Mandy doubted she'd ever slip anything on that particular finger. ""I didn't know if marriage was something that was super important to me,"" she says. ""I thought, maybe I don't need that in my life."" Part of the disillusionment: Last year, after 30 years of matrimony, Mandy's high-school sweetheart parents divorced. ""It shakes you to the core,"" she says. ""I didn't take the decision [to get married] lightly. I ventured into it realistically. But life takes you places you wouldn't have expected. I'm really content with what was in the cards for me.""</p><p>The newlyweds live in the L.A. home Mandy bought seven years ago, and together they've settled into a low-key routine that includes shopping in their funky East Side neighborhood, playing board games (""I tend to be really competitive when it comes to Scattergories""), and evenings in watching documentaries (a favorite lately: Style Wars, about New York City graffiti artists). Ryan handles most of the cooking; Mandy cleans up afterward. ""We're quiet people who live a normal, boring life,"" she says. Rounding out the family: Joni, a 1 1/2-year-old terrier mix, named after Joni Mitchell, that Mandy adopted from a shelter. ""She came right over and put her little chin on my knee, and sort of sighed, like, 'I'm home,'"" she recalls. ""I just knew."" </p><p>Similarly, Mandy follows her gut when it comes to nourishing her body and mind. ""I'm into having balance in my life and trying to treat myself well,"" she says. That means hikes, plus Pilates three to four times a week and acupuncture sessions. ""I've come to love acupuncture,"" she says. ""It's so restorative. It brings me back to myself."" She also goes to therapy, which she first tried a little over a year ago. ""You go in thinking, 'Wow, I have nothing to talk about. Where is this hour gonna go?' And before you know it, time's up,"" she says. ""I don't have to burden my friends with the same things over and over again, and it's fascinating to get an unbiased point of view, to not feel like anybody would judge you. It's very freeing.""<br /></p>",success stories

Squeeze the stability ball between your feet. Lift your legs toward the ceiling so they're over your hips. Keeping your right shoulder pressed to the floor, let your legs lower toward the left as far as you can. Use your core to pull the ball back to the starting position and repeat to the other side. 1-2Exercise   <br /><br />Back Rollout <br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0601_back_rollout.jpg"" /><br /><br />Kneel in front of the ball and place your hands on top of it, shoulder-width apart, arms straight.

Tighten your core to keep the ball still. Lift your right knee until your hip forms a 90-degree angle while simultaneously lifting your left arm overhead. Lower and repeat on the other side without letting the ball move. Perform 20 reps. Too easy? Grab a pair of 2- or 3-pound dumbbells. 1Exercise   <br /><br />Prone Cobra <br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0601_prone_cobra.jpg"" /><br /><br />Lie facedown on a stability ball, keeping it under your belly.

Repeat with the left leg and alternate for two sets of each sequence. 2Exercise   <br /><br />Step Lunge Pulse<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0601_step_lunge.jpg"" /><br /><br />Stand in front of a step (or Bosu or foam pad) and step onto it, placing your left foot flat on top. Sink your weight down into a lunge. Keeping your foot on the step, press up and then sink down again for another rep. Perform 10 reps and then switch sides for two sets. 2Exercise   <br /><br />0Lunge Kick and Curl<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0601_lunge_kick.jpg"" /><br /><br />Grab two dumbbells and step left leg back into a reverse lunge.

Do 10 reps before switching legs; do two to three sets.2-3Exercise   <br /><br />1Overhead Lunge Walk<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0601_overhead_lunge_walk.jpg"" /><br /><br />Hold a light barbell or two dumbbells at arm's length over your head, palms facing forward. Pull your abs in toward your spine to stabilize your core. Step your left leg forward into a lunge, then press up and step forward into a lunge with your right leg. 3-4Exercise   <br /><br />2Flamingo Lunge<br /><br /><img src=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0601_flamingo_lunge.jpg"" /><br /><br />Hold a medicine ball in front of your chest at shoulder height. Step back with your right foot into a reverse lunge. As you push up to start, press the ball over your head as you lift your right leg in front, bending your right knee to 90 degrees. Balance for a second. Lower the weight and repeat on the same leg for 10 reps. Then repeat with your left leg and alternate for two to three sets on each side.2-3",Workouts

To get the most from your water world, you have to apply the principles of thermodynamics, biology, and chemistry. You remember this stuff, right? Didn't think so. Which is why we tapped scientists, researchers, and beauty gurus for a refresher course and some help concocting a formula for the ultimate tub trip (no lab-geek goggles required). Now, be a good sponge and soak it up.<br /><br /><b>Pre-Tub Prep...</b><br /><br /><b>Tweak the temp</b><br />You want to soak in water that's 97 to 99 degrees--just like you are. Any hotter and your nervous system goes into overdrive, as it struggles to adjust your internal thermostat. Translation: Might as well drop a blow-dryer into the water. Avoid shocking your system by measuring the temperature of your tub. <br /><b><i>WH</i> Pick: Mobi Digital Bath and Room Thermometer</b> ($13, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://target.com"">target.com</a>)<br /><br /><b>Cue up the tunes</b><br />A 2006 Temple University study found that people who listen to music during a colonoscopy require less sedation. Now, you don't need to be unconscious to enjoy a bath. But if Lily Allen can make an intestinal probe more pleasant, just imagine what she could do for tub time. So crank your tunes, and think, ""At least I didn't have a colonoscopy today."" <br /><b><i>WH</i> Pick: Every Audio Shower Mirror </b>A transmitter beams music from your iPod to water-resistant speakers hanging on the shower wall.

To simulate twilight in your bathroom, turn off the lights and cleanse by candlelight. <br /><b><i>WH </i>Pick: SpaFinder No-Flame Candle </b>A flame-shaped LED mimics the light produced by a lit wick--flicker and all--minus the messy wax and fire risk. Coolest part: The light goes out when you blow on the bulb. Yabba dabba yawn. ($12, 800-367-2866)<br /><br /><b>In You Go...</b><br /><br /><b>Sink deeper</b><br />Dunk underwater until just your face peeks out. ""The more of you that touches that water, the more you benefit,"" says Reinhard Bergel, Ph.D., coauthor of <i>The Spa Encyclopedia</i>. Warmth dilates capillaries, increasing the stream of nutrients and oxygen to every cell in the body--relaxing you from your neck to your toes.<br /><b><i>WH</i> Pick: Deep Water Bath Overflow Cover</b> Block the overflow drain with this suction cup and fill your tub as high as you want.

Their key component is magnesium, a powerhouse mineral that regulates hundreds of enzymes in our bodies. So it's no big surprise that all kinds of pesky health complaints--from cramps to headaches to irritability--have been linked to magnesium deficiency.

Opt for coconut butter, which is rich in lock-thickening fatty acids.

A Cornell University study showed that those lucky people fall asleep faster and sleep more deeply. Study author Patricia Murphy, Ph.D., suggests emerging from a warm bath 60 to 90 minutes before bedtime to stimulate a quick dive in degrees. <br /><br /><b>Seal the deal</b><br />Moisturize with the same stuff Cleopatra used: pure oil. Because it doesn't mix with water, oil forms a film over wet skin, sealing in moisture, says Neil Sadick, M.D., a New York City dermatologist. If you have time to air-dry, skip the towel, lube up, wrap yourself in a robe, and let your skin soak it all in.<br /><b><i>WH</i> Picks: Origins Nourishing Oil for Body and Massage </b>($29 for 3.4 oz, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.origins.com"">origins.com</a> for stores); <b>Warmrails Wonderbar</b> Hang this heated bar from your towel rack to keep your robe toasty.

Your tired, creaky <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/build-muscle-strength"">muscles</a> are aching for a little attention too. Fortunately you can melt away muscle tension with a few good rubs and keep your pain from sidelining your workouts. Muscle creams are generally easy to find, and they soothe varying levels of soreness - even after just one application. Most work by <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/indigestion-or-heart-attack"">boosting circulation</a> enough to remove lactic acid, a buildup of muscular debris that occurs when you pump blood to your muscles faster than it flows back to your heart, says Allan Levy, Ph.D., coauthor of the Sports Injury Handbook. To help you loosen up, WH editors really pushed it (we ran harder and longer, put in extra time at the gym, and signed up for a new Pilates class), then tested six salves to see whether they hit the spot.<br /><br /><b>Aloette Soothing Muscle Rejuvenator</b><br /><br />2-oz tube sold as part of <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.aloettecosmetics.com"">Aloette's Stress Free Living Kit</a>: $45<br /><br /><b>Tester Says:</b>""This lightweight lotion left a cool layer of relief on my shoulders and back, and it lasted for a few hours after my weight-lifting session.""<br /><br /><b>Key Ingredients:</b>Menthol, witch hazel, and St. John's wort oil<br /><br /><b>Why it Works</b><br />Menthol combines with energizing witch hazel, a tingling astringent that draws inflammation from the area, says Sue Williams, N.D., a naturopathic physician at Phoenix Body Positive in Arizona. It also contains St. John's wort, ""an herb which has tannin and amentoflavone, components that also reduce inflammation,"" she says.<br /><br /><b>Best for</b> moderate soreness (like an achy deskbound back) and anytime you want continuous cooling relief. It smells a lot better than most rubs too - like cloves, not medicine. You can apply this cream frequently without irritating your skin - or your neighbors.<br /><br /><b>Hyland's Arnica Montana 1X</b><br /><br />$6.50 for 1 oz, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.homeopathiclaboratories.com/"">Homeopathic Laboratories</a><br /><br /><b>Tester Says:</b>""Surgery left my back muscles constantly sore, but this thick, nontingling ointment eased most of the tension and pain about 10 minutes after I applied. It also absorbed quickly, leaving my skin super smooth.""<br /><br /><b>Key Ingredients:</b>Arnica and beeswax<br /><br /><b>Why it Works</b> <br />It's virtually pure arnica (a European herb that grows from Spain all the way to southern Scandinavia), which increases blood flow, moving old blood (like bruises) away from an injury and bringing in fresh healing reserves. Beeswax thickens the cream to help bind the arnica to your skin so it won't rub off. <br /><br /><b>Best for</b> super-sore muscles and actual sprains. You can apply it as frequently as needed, and it's virtually fragrance-free (there's a hint of black licorice scent, but it's not offensive). You can also dab a little on bruises - just avoid broken skin.<br /><br /><b>Badger Sore Muscle Rub </b><br /><br />$8 for 2 oz, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://uncommonscents.com/"">Uncommon Scents</a><br /><br /><b>Tester Says:</b> ""This waxy balm completely calmed my shoulders and upper back after a day spent hunched over my computer, but it also left my hands sticky - so I waited just a few minutes before -putting on a shirt.""<br /><br /><b>Key Ingredients:</b>Cayenne extract, ginger, and extra virgin olive oil<br /><br /><b>Why it Works</b><br />Extra virgin olive oil is moisturizing and ultra-penetrating, so the cayenne pepper extracts (better known as capsaicin) can get into skin to work on reducing pain. Capsaicin (which dates back to the mid-16th century, when cayenne pepper was used for everything from stroke prevention to toothache treatment) works as a counter-irritant, producing a small amount of swelling and redness, which warms the area and increases healing circulation. The slight skin irritation it can cause helps mask deep-seated pain. <br /><br /><b>Best for</b> preemptive protection. The rub quickly increases circulation, so it can help warm and loosen your muscles faster before your workout. The spicy ginger smell also delivers a mental wake-up. It's good for minor soreness, but if you need to apply it more than twice, switch to a more potent balm.<br /><br /><b>Kathleen Lewis Stiff And Sore</b><br /><br />$24 for 4 oz, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://vickerey.com/"">Vickerey</a><br /><br /><b>Tester Says:</b>""After my first Pilates session in 2 months, I applied this light cream to my abs. It was a little greasy, but the next day I could stretch my arms over my head without feeling like I was going to tear myself in half.""<br /><br /><b>Key Ingredients:</b>Arnica, comfrey, and peppermint <br /><br /><b>Why it Works</b><br />Tea tree oil helps arnica quickly penetrate (the oil has -chemical properties that cause it to dissolve into your skin), and the comfrey is a centuries-old (we're talking monks in the Middle Ages), homeopathic bruise remedy that stimulates tissue repair and nerve regeneration. <br /><br /><b>Best for</b> deep-tissue massage. The balm contains grapeseed oil, which makes it slick. It will also soothe your sinuses, and the strong peppermint odor is -pleasant - like Doublemint gum.<br /><br /><b>Tiger Balm Pain Relieving Ointment </b><br /><br />$5 for .63 oz, <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.drugstore.com/"">Drugstore.com</a><br /><br /><b>Tester Says:</b>""My calves ball into rocks after I run. Within seconds of applying the slightly slippery ointment, my calves started tingling until they were practically numb. I woke up the next morning and the knots had unraveled.""<br /><br /><b>Key Ingredients:</b> Menthol and camphor<br /><br /><b>Why it Works</b> <br />These two ingredients make up a super-potent 11 percent of the balm - a highly concentrated dose compared with the amount in other balms, Dr. Levy says. Menthol (derived from peppermint and other mint oils that contain anesthetic properties) soothes and helps counter the topical numbing effect of the camphor. Camphor comes from an Asian evergreen tree, and, though it produces a cooling feeling like menthol, it tends to be stronger.

http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/back-pain-relief,Health,1,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,,How to Get Back Pain Relief,http://www.womenshealthmag.com/sites/womenshealthmag.com/files/images/0705-baby-got-1621.gif,"At 26, I felt feisty, athletic, and downright invincible.<b> </b>It wasn't until I broke a mean sweat at the gym on a random afternoon and something gave out in my lower body that my perspective began to change. My lumbar, bum, and left leg screamed like a trio of Mega Millions lottery winners -- the sensation was so intense that I was bed-bound the next day. My doctor's advice? Pop prescription-strength Aleve and get some rest (as if I had a choice). Sure enough, my pain eased after a week, and a month later, I seemed like myself again.<br /><br />Though I felt entirely alone in my achy breaky <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/yoga/yoga-to-ease-lower-back-pain"">back pain</a>, it turns out I'm just another stat. Studies show it's the number one cause of limitations to physical activity for people under the age of 45, and it's the number two reason we call in sick (just after colds and flu and that sadistic <i>Oprah</i> rerun with James Frey). So what gives -- besides our bodies?<br /><br />""In your 20s, it's most likely caused by a <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/fashion-hazards"">muscle strain</a> or a [problem with a] disk,"" one of the spongy cushions between the vertebrae, explains Daveed Frazier, M.D., an orthopedic spine surgeon at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City. (Dr. Frazier also became my specialist.) For most patients, back pain improves within a couple of weeks or so. But while most strains will eventually heal by themselves, an injured disk can grow worse -- that is, unless you take serious steps to prevent future problems. That's why I suggest starting now.<br /><br />Part of the trouble is that the human spine isn't as strong as one might imagine, and disks are among the weaker links. As early as your 20s, your spine suddenly becomes less willing to tolerate the abuse you put it through; sitting for long periods, slouching, lifting, and even exercising can cause damage. Disks are intended to absorb shock, but over time, they flatten and dry out. And should they bulge (called herniated or ruptured disks), they may end up poking nearby nerves, causing serious pain. Eventually, I was diagnosed with sciatica, which occurs when a herniated disk presses on the roots of the sciatic nerve that runs down each leg. This affects 1 to 2 percent of all people, usually between the ages of 30 and 50. Reminder: I was only 26 at the time. Lucky me.<br /><br /><b>Six years later...</b><br /><br />My back pain (and sciatica) returned -- this time during spinning class while I was training for a honeymoon cycling trip in France. And once again, my doctor prescribed a simple treatment: Rest for 2 to 3 days, ice for 20 minutes every hour for 2 days (if ice doesn't help, try heat compresses), and take over-the-counter pain meds as needed. What made his Rx different this time was that he suggested physical therapy (PT) after the rest period -- and told me to keep moving.<br /><br />Jeffrey Goldstein, M.D., a spine surgeon at the New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases, couldn't agree more about the need for physical activity -- and physical therapy. ""The biggest mistake people make with back pain is to lie around and eat Advil until the pain goes away,"" he says. For me, a typical 1-hour PT session included assisted stretching, as well as strengthening and stretching my lower torso, hips, and hamstrings. Weekly massages and electric stimulation can also ease muscle tension and help keep pain at bay. Regardless of your regimen, expect to visit a physical therapist 3 days a week for about a month. If you're not better after that, go back to your primary M.D. or see a pain, nerve, or orthopedic specialist. An epidural, more PT, or stronger meds may be in your future.<br /><br /><b>Haven't got time for the pain</b><br /><br />Just because you feel better doesn't mean you're off the hook. Talk to your doctor about trying these six steps to avoid a nasty redux.<br /><br /><b>1)Build fab abs. </b>""Don't just go for the six-pack,"" Dr. Frazier says. ""Strengthen the muscles that go around your entire spine: the obliques [the diagonal abdominal muscles on the sides of your torso], the abs in front, and the back muscles."" This helps evenly distribute impact on your vertebrae. Work your abs three or more times a week for at least 10 minutes at a time; <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/workouts"">click here</a> forgreat core-builders.<br /><br /><b>2)Make like Gumby. </b>When your hamstrings, hips, and back are tight, they put extra stress on your spine, which can cause pain later on. Stretch those muscles at least 5 minutes a day before bed and at the end of each workout.<br /><br /><b>3)Learn the pickup line.</b> You already know to lift everything from a 5-pound bag of groceries to a 50-pound barbell by bending your knees, hugging the object close, and pressing up with your legs and abs. But many make the mistake of twisting to one side as they lift. Not you! Lift facing the same direction as your hips, with equal weight on each leg.<br /><br /><b>4)Stand (and sit) smart.</b> Mom was right again! Slouching is bad -- it strains your lower back. So does sitting with your knees at the same height as your hips, experts say. Shut everyone up by lowering your knees below hip level while seated ""to maintain the natural curve in your back,"" says Natalia Glenn, a physical therapist in Katonah, New York.<br /><br /><b>5)Get a brand-new bag. </b>We don't care if your oversize Marc Jacobs makes your office rival more envious than a bald man at a Hugh Grant movie. The heavy-handbag trend is a common cause of back pain in women, according to the American Chiropractic Association. Don't let your purse weigh more than 10 percent of what you do.<br /><br /><b>6)Stop with the Snickers.</b> Extra jelly in your belly pulls you forward, creating an exaggerated curve in your back. ""It puts additional pressure on the disks, which can make them bulge,"" explains Michele S. Olson, Ph.D., a professor of exercise science at Auburn University Montgomery.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, I learned these preventive measures too late to benefit. Instead, I spent a year experimenting with everything from massages and meds to an epidural injection. But my bulging disk would not relent. At one point, the pain was so awful I could barely walk, not to mention leave the house for dinner -- or stay in for sex. That's when Dr. Frazier began t talk surgery. He performed a discectomy, which removed the part of the disk that bulged -- and sure enough, it worked. Eight years later, I have no plans to run a marathon, but I practice yoga and strength train, and I can ride my bike up and down hills with a 37-pound toddler in tow. Next year, who knows? Maybe Provence again.<br />",You and Improved

According to Carol Rossi, a yoga instructor based in Los Angeles, confidence can be developed the second you challenge yourself. ""The practice of yoga poses is a mirror for the practice of life,"" she says. ""So over time you will find yourself more confident in situations off the mat."" They key is realizing that while your body may never bend like Seane Corn's in a <a target=""_blank"" href=""/yoga/standing-forward-bend-pose""><strong>standing forward bend (uttanasana)</strong></a>, you can still get the same benefits. ""Confidence is developed by realizing that, in yoga, you're not just trying to achieve some ideal shape, but are working to appreciate your gifts and limitations,"" Rossi says. In other words, the goal in <em>uttanasana</em> is not to wipe the sweat from your brow on your shins. So try spending less time looking in the mirror and a little more looking within yourself at how the pose feels.

If you're balanced here, try these additional challenges: (a) move your foot higher up on the inside of the thigh and focus on the alignment of your hips; (b) slowly raise your arms over your head, keeping your palms together; (c) close your eyes for the ultimate balance test.

A meticulous training program, and lots and lots of laps.<br /><br /><b></b></p><p><br /><b>What are your goals for the Olympics? </b><br /><br />Definitely to medal. At Worlds I got to race the world record<br />holder, Jessicah Schipper. She won gold and I got silver. I'd love to<br />beat her. Just the opportunity to race her again would be great. She'll<br />bring out the best in me again I hope.</p><p><b>How do you handle the stress of it all? </b><br /><br />I just try to think of the process and not so much the end result. If<br />I'm working hard and doing everything I can, in the end it will all<br />come together. I'm taking care of the small details: sleeping, drinking<br />water, and eating healthy foods. Having that knowledge that I'm<br />preparing well gives me comfort and confidence.</p><p><b>What's your schedule like right now? </b><br /><br />My typical day is to wake up at 5:15 in the morning, and grab some<br />coffee and toast. I head to the pool from 6 to 8 A.M., then go to the<br />weight room from 8:15 to 9:15. I lift and do lots of stretching then.<br />In the springtime we swim again from 1:30 to 3:30 P.M., then sometimes<br />I'll do cardio, on an elliptical, for 30 to 40 minutes. Once or twice a<br />week <a href=""/fitness/kim-vandenberg-swimming-workout"">I do Pilates</a> at night.</p><p>I try to go to bed around 9, but I have a hard time sleeping that early. Usually it's closer to 10. </p><p><b>Wow. You must get sore a lot. What are your <a href=""/fitness"">fitness tips</a> to relieve sore muscles? </b><br /><br />I take hot showers--that usually helps. I have a great body oil that I<br />use from Dr. Hauschka's skin care line. It warms my muscles up. I'll<br />use that or go get a massage from a trainer. Stretching on a daily<br />basis really helps me too, and drinking lots of water.</p><p><b>How do you keep yourself going on tough days in the pool? </b><br /><br />That is a tough one. I just try to get through it when I'm not<br />feeling great. I just stay positive, and focus on little details like<br />my breathing and my body positions. That's really hard though and I'm<br />still working on that.</p><p>I tell myself that the pain I go through is only going to help me in<br />the end, and I keep that in the back of my mind. If it wasn't for pain<br />I wouldn't be improving. I try to embrace it and know it will help me.<br />And all the pain makes the end result that much more satisfying. </p><p><b>What kind of food do you eat when you're training? </b><br /><br />I never eat just two or three big meals.Instead I eat four to five smaller meals each day.I try to incorporate a lot of fruits and vegetables and plenty of water. For swimming I need lots of carbs and proteins, but I try to keep it all balanced.</p><p>Before practice I usually eat an energy bar--I love the Harvest Grain Bars. After practice I'll eat a sandwich with whole grain bread, turkey or tuna, cheese, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and lots of veggies in general.I love granola and cottage cheese, and fresh fruits.I can't stop eating pineapples and mangos.I go to Whole Foods every day almost.</p><p>We burn so many calories, that it's really important to keep enough food in your body.But I do try to make the foods I eat healthy ones, by eating really good balanced meals without huge portion sizes.</p><p><b>Do you have any guilty pleasures?</b><br />Definitely.I really like Italian food.Pretty much all Italian food is my guilty pleasure.Though some Italian is healthy, I like the dishes with the thicker cream sauces.There's this one dish--pumpkin tortellini with cream sauce--that I get at this restaurant we go to.I can't stop eating it!</p><p>I also like bacon.I try to eat turkey bacon, but sometimes I'll give in and go with regular.</p><p><b>Do you smell like chlorine all the time?I swim once a week and all my co-workers know exactly which day it is. </b><br /><br />Yeah, I really do. I always have to shower right after the pool.A lot of swimmers don't, but I take at least two or three showers a day.Still, I always have that faint scent.When the swimmers come to the weight room after practice, the whole place smells like chlorine.</p><p><b>What kind of swimming tips would you give to a rec swimmer like me?</b><br /><br />Try to focus more on your core, not on your legs or your arms.Power comes from the core; from your abs.A lot of rec swimmers kick really hard or flail their arms. They are wasting their energy.Rotation comes from the body.</p><p>A good drill is to lie on the water with your arms at your sides, then slowly start to kick to feel the balance between your head and your body.Finally, start to use your arms.You'll realize that your core is where it all comes from. </p><p><b>What's your favorite part of being a swimmer? </b><br /><br />The lifestyle.Living a healthy life, working out and being outdoors. We swim outside, unlike people in the Midwest and East Coast. This whole environment is awesome.Having teammates helping me to be the best I can be is a great feeling.</p><p><b>Your least favorite part? </b><br /><br />Probably waking up at 5 in the morning.And, in the winter when it's raining.When it's cold outside, I hate being half-naked and freezing the whole time.</p><p><b>Will you continue after the Olympics? </b><br /><br />Yeah, I would like to do some fall meets this year, starting in<br />October. There's a lot of meets in really cool places like Brazil and<br />South Africa. So hopefully that will work out. I could see myself<br />competing into 2009 but after that I'm not sure. It depends how I do<br />this year. So far I just want to get the best times I can. I'm still<br />getting better, so I don't see any reason to stop. </p><p><b>If you could choose an Olympic sport other than swimming, what would it be? </b><br /><br />Probably beach volleyball. I have a lot of fun playing volleyball, and<br />a lot of friends who played volleyball. I love to watch it. I'm just<br />not as graceful on land as I am in the water.</p><p><b>Do you ever get a chance to relax?What do you do? </b><br /><br />I love going to the beach. I'm 15 minutes from the water.Catching up with friends, watching movies, going out to eat, doing game nights.I'm pretty mellow because I train so much.</p><p>I like to read.I'm really into Jodi Picoult right now.I just read about five of her books and liked them all a lot.</p><p><b>What's the one piece of clothing you live in? </b><br /><br />My Havaianas sandals, because I'm so used to walking around barefoot.My feet get really hot when I wear real shoes!It's ridiculous.</p><p><b>We have <a target=""_blank"" href=""/life/what039s-the-weirdest-thing-in-your-purse"">an ongoing discussion</a> with readers about the weirdest thing in their purse.
